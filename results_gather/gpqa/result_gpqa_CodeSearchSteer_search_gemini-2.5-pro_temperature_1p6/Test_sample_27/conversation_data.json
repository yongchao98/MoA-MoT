    "The chemical transformation occurs in four sequential steps. Let's analyze the stereochemical outcome of each step to determine the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n(S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the hydroxyl group (-OH) as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (-OTBS). This step does not affect the stereocenter at C4, so the product is (S)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Tandem conjugate addition and alkylation**\nProduct 1 is treated with diphenylcopperlithium (Ph2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Conjugate Addition:** The phenyl group (Ph-) from the Gilman reagent adds to the C3 position of the α,β-unsaturated ketone in a 1,4-Michael addition. The bulky OTBS group at C4, which has an (S) configuration, directs the incoming phenyl nucleophile to the opposite face of the ring, resulting in a *trans* relationship. This establishes the stereochemistry at C3 as (R).\n*   **Alkylation:** The intermediate enolate formed is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The bulky phenyl group now at C3(R) directs the incoming benzyl group to add to the C2 position from the opposite face, leading to a *trans* arrangement between the benzyl and phenyl groups. This sets the stereocenter at C2 as (S).\n*   Therefore, Product 2 is (2S, 3R, 4S)-2-benzyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Methylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and iodomethane (CH3I) at a low temperature.\n*   **Enolate Formation:** LDA is a strong, sterically hindered base that, under low-temperature (kinetic) conditions, selectively deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon. In Product 2, the α-carbons are C2 (tertiary, substituted with benzyl) and C6 (secondary). LDA will preferentially remove a proton from C6 to form the kinetic enolate.\n*   **Alkylation:** The resulting enolate reacts with iodomethane. The bulky substituents already on the ring (benzyl at C2, phenyl at C3, and OTBS at C4) are most stable in equatorial positions. They sterically hinder one face of the molecule, forcing the methyl group to attack from the less-hindered axial direction. Axial methylation at the C6 position results in the (6S) configuration.\n*   Thus, Product 3 is (2S, 3R, 4S, 6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nProduct 3 is treated with aqueous HCl. The acid cleaves the TBS ether, converting the -OTBS group back into a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction does not affect any of the chiral centers.\nThe final product, Product 4, is therefore **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\nThis structure matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
