    "Here's a detailed analysis of the reaction sequences to determine the best path for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **Target Molecule Analysis**\n\nThe final product has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1. This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3. This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5. This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nAll three groups are in a *meta* position relative to each other (1,3,5-substitution). The key challenge is introducing the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at a *meta* position relative to the other two.\n\n### **Evaluation of Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's examine each option step-by-step:\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Bromobenzene**: This is a standard bromination.\n2.  **Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene**: Nitration of bromobenzene occurs mainly at the *para* position because the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This leads to the wrong isomer.\n3.  **1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene → ?**: A Friedel-Crafts acylation on this ring is extremely difficult because the ring is heavily deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone**: This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard procedure.\n2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone**: The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so bromination correctly places the bromine at the 3-position.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**: In this step, the ring has an acetyl group (at C1) and a bromo group (at C3).\n    *   The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The *ortho, para*-directing bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    Since the directing preferences of the two groups conflict, this reaction would likely produce a mixture of isomers, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired product. Furthermore, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) in this option are nonsensical as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl ; iv) H₃PO₂ ...**\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene**: Correct.\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline**: Correct reduction.\n3.  **Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**: Correct diazotization.\n4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene**: This deamination step converts the product back to the starting material, benzene. This entire sequence is unproductive.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n\nThis sequence is complex and employs a common synthetic strategy of using a powerful directing group which is later removed.\n\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene**: A standard nitration.\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH₂), which is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director.\n3.  **Aniline → Acetanilide**: Aniline reacts with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl). However, a Friedel-Crafts reaction on aniline fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. The actual reaction that occurs is N-acylation to form acetanilide (C₆H₅NHCOCH₃). This step serves to protect the amine and reduce its activating strength.\n4.  **Acetanilide → 4-Bromoacetanilide**: The acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is a strong *ortho, para*-director. Bromination will occur predominantly at the *para* position (C4) due to the bulkiness of the acetamido group, giving 4-bromoacetanilide.\n5.  **4-Bromoacetanilide → 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide**: Now, we nitrate 4-bromoacetanilide. The powerful *ortho, para*-directing acetamido group will direct the nitro group to its *ortho* position (C2), as the *para* position is blocked by bromine. The bromo group also directs *ortho* to the same position. This gives 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.\n6.  **4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide → 4-Bromo-2-nitroaniline**: This step should be the hydrolysis of the acetamido group back to an amino group, typically using acid or base (e.g., H₃O⁺/heat), to yield 4-bromo-2-nitroaniline. The sequence listed here (NaNO₂/HCl) is incorrect for this transformation and belongs later.\n7.  The final product required is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. None of the paths seem to lead directly to the product with high yield based on a strict reading.\n\nHowever, there is likely a typo in the options, and we must find the most plausible intended pathway. Let's reconsider Option B.\n\n**Revised Analysis of Option B:**\n1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone** (Good)\n2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone** (Good, acetyl is a meta-director)\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (Problematic due to conflicting directors, leading to low yield)\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction in step B(iii). Although the directors conflict, the directing power is not equal. The acetyl group is a moderate deactivator, while bromine is a weak deactivator. Both inductively withdraw, but bromine's lone pairs provide some resonance donation, activating the o,p positions. Position 5 is meta to both the acetyl and bromo groups, making it quite deactivated. However, it's also the only position where one of the groups (the acetyl group) directs. In practice, nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the 3-bromo-5-nitro product, along with other isomers. The problem states \"high-yield\", which this step might not fulfill.\n\nLet's rethink the entire synthesis from scratch to find the best route, which may highlight the intended logic of one of the options.\n\n**Optimal Synthesis Path (The \"Textbook\" Method):**\nA superior method to create a 1,3,5-substitution pattern with an o,p-director is to introduce a placeholder group that can be removed later. This involves diazotization and deamination.\n\n1.  **Start with Acetanilide**: (From Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Acetanilide).\n2.  **Brominate**: Bromination of acetanilide gives **p-Bromoacetanilide** (high yield).\n3.  **Nitrate**: Nitration of p-bromoacetanilide gives **4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide**. The powerful acetamido group directs the nitro group to the ortho position.\n4.  **Hydrolyze**: Acidic hydrolysis (H₃O⁺) removes the acetyl protecting group to give **4-Bromo-2-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **Diazotize**: React with NaNO₂/HCl at 0-5°C to convert the -NH₂ group into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), yielding **4-bromo-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n6.  **Reduce (Deaminate)**: React with hypophosphorous acid (H₃PO₂) to replace the diazonium group with a hydrogen atom. This gives **1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene**.\n7.  **Acylate**: Perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃. Both the bromo and nitro groups are deactivating and direct to position 5 relative to the bromo group (meta to both). This gives the final product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This final Friedel-Crafts reaction is on a highly deactivated ring and is therefore difficult.\n\nThis textbook route is long and has a difficult final step. Let's reconsider the direct approach from option B:\n**Benzene → Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\nThe key is the third step. While the directing groups conflict, the acetyl group strongly directs meta, and the position it directs to (C5) is the only one not strongly disfavored by the bromo group's electronics (it's not o/p). This pathway, while perhaps not \"high-yield\" in an absolute sense, is very direct. Given the significant flaws in the other options (A, C, D), option B presents the most chemically sound initial sequence, despite its subsequent nonsensical steps and the potential for isomer formation. The question might be flawed, but B is the most plausible choice among the flawed options.\n\nFinal evaluation concludes that sequence B is the most direct and logical approach to get to the target molecule, assuming the unnecessary final steps are disregarded. The conflicting directors in the last step are a drawback, but it is more viable than the incorrect isomer paths or failed reactions in the other options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
