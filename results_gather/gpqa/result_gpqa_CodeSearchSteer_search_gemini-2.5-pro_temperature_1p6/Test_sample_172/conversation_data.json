    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n1.  **Find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n    The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The minimal uncertainty is given by the relation:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n    Given the uncertainty in the electron's location is Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n    We can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum as:\n    Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n2.  **Relate uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n    For a particle, the relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) can be found. Since the electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, while c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    where m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n    To find the relationship between the uncertainties, we can differentiate this equation:\n    2E dE = 2p c² dp\n    dE = (pc² / E) dp\n\n    For a relativistic particle, the velocity is given by v = pc²/E. Therefore:\n    dE = v * dp\n\n    For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n3.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n    Using the calculated uncertainty in momentum (Δp) and the given speed of the electron (v):\n    ΔE ≈ (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n    C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    D) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n    The calculated value is closest to ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
