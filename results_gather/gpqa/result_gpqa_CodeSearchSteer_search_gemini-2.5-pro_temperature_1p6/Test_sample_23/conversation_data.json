    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   **Information given:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It's the sole product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. It is also widely used as a solvent.\n*   **Analysis:** A saturated hydrocarbon can be an alkane (general formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or a cycloalkane (general formula CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ), the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n        %H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n × 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.2857%.\n    *   This value matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   For an alkane (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂), the calculation does not yield a sensible integer for 'n'.\n*   **Conclusion:** Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ. Given that it is a widely used solvent, the most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula where n=6.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize Mixture Y\n\n*   **Information given:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X. Y does not decolorize bromine water. Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y.\n*   **Analysis:** \"Does not decolorize bromine water\" implies the components are saturated or aromatic. Since Z (cyclohexane) is one component, let's call the other component Y₂. The hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + Y₂) yields only cyclohexane. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, this means Y₂ must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   A compound that is not an alkene/alkyne but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**. This combination fits all the given criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y\n\n*   **Information given:** Mixture X is treated with heated platinum to form mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction. Mixture X consists of two equimolar liquids that decolorize bromine water and do not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **Reaction:** The conversion of X to Y is:\n    Mixture X → Mixture Y\n    (Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂) → (Cyclohexane + Benzene)\n*   **Analysis:** This is a disproportionation reaction where hydrogen atoms are transferred between molecules. The products, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆), are formed in an equimolar ratio. By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = H atoms in C₆H₁₂ + H atoms in C₆H₆ = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ must be 18.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\n*   **Verification:** To ensure our conclusion is chemically sound, we can identify plausible candidates for the two liquids in mixture X.\n    *   They must both have a six-carbon skeleton to produce only cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   They must be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water).\n    *   They must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   They must react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce cyclohexane and benzene.\n    *   A plausible reaction is a hydrogen transfer between **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n        C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n    *   This proposed mixture fits all the conditions:\n        *   Both are liquids that decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Hydrogenation of both C₆H₁₀ and C₆H₈ yields C₆H₁₂.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the atom conservation from the determined products (cyclohexane and benzene), the total is:\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nThis corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in the two components of mixture X.\n\n<<<A>>>"
