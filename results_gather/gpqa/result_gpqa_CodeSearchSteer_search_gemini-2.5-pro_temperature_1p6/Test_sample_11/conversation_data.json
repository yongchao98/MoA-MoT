    "The search results confirm my calculation method and the results.\n\n-   **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:** The decay of a stationary particle into two products means the products must have equal and opposite momenta. The initial energy (rest mass of the pion) is converted into the total energy (rest mass + kinetic energy) of the products.\n-   **Q-Value:** The total kinetic energy of the products is equal to the energy released in the decay (Q-value), which is the difference between the initial and final rest masses: Q = m_pi*c² - m_mu*c².\n-   **Calculated Values:** One source explicitly calculates the kinetic energy of the muon to be 4.12 MeV. Another source, using slightly different mass values (in terms of electron mass), calculates the muon's kinetic energy to be 4.08 MeV and the neutrino's to be 29.65 MeV, which is very close to my result. HyperPhysics also states the measured kinetic energy of the muon is 4.13 MeV.\n\nMy calculation steps were:\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** `p_mu = p_nu = p` (since the pion is at rest).\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`.\n3.  **Energy Expressions:**\n    *   For the muon: `E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2`\n    *   For the massless neutrino: `E_nu = KE_nu = p_nu * c = p * c`\n4.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E_mu^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n5.  **Solving for Energies:** By substituting and solving the system of equations, I found:\n    *   KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV\n    *   KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values directly correspond to option C.\n\nThe problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the decay of the stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ).\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The Pi+ is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν ≈ 0).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the initial momentum of the system is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles—the muon and the neutrino—must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call the magnitude of the momentum 'p'.\n*   `p_μ = p_ν = p`\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n*   `E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n*   `E_final = E_μ + E_ν`\n\nBy the conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`.\n*   `139.6 MeV = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n**4. Energy and Momentum Calculation:**\nThe energy of the massless neutrino is given by `E_ν = p * c`.\nThe total energy of the muon is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`.\n\nWe can substitute `E_ν` for `p*c` in the muon's energy equation:\n*   `E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, we have `E_μ = 139.6 MeV - E_ν`. Substituting this into the equation above:\n*   `(139.6 - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (105.7)²`\n*   `139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + 105.7²`\n*   `19488.16 - 279.2 * E_ν = 11172.49`\n*   `279.2 * E_ν = 19488.16 - 11172.49`\n*   `279.2 * E_ν = 8315.67`\n*   `E_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n*   **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\n**5. Kinetic Energy of the Muon:**\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass between the parent particle and the products.\n*   `KE_total = (m_π - m_μ) * c² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino.\n*   `KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν`\n*   `33.9 MeV = KE_μ + 29.8 MeV`\n*   `KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV`\n\nA more precise value can be found using the calculated total energy of the muon:\n*   `E_μ = 139.6 MeV - E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV`\n*   `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV`\n\nUsing the unrounded numbers gives:\n*   `KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This result is confirmed by multiple physics resources.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n*   B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n*   C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n*   D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
