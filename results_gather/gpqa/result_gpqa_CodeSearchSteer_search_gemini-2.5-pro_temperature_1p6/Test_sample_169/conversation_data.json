    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨Sy⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Normalize the spin state:**\nThe given unnormalized spin state is:\n|χ⟩ = [3i, 4]\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find its norm and divide by it. The squared norm is given by ⟨χ|χ⟩. The bra vector ⟨χ| is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector |χ⟩:\n⟨χ| = [-3i, 4]\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product:\n⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nThe normalization constant, A, is 1 over the square root of this value:\nA = 1/√25 = 1/5.\n\nSo, the normalized spin state is:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/5) * [3i, 4]\n\n**2. Define the spin operator in the y-direction (Sy):**\nThe spin operator S_y is related to the Pauli spin matrix σ_y by the formula:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n\nGiven the Pauli matrix for spin y:\nσ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nThe spin operator S_y is:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value ⟨Sy⟩:**\nThe expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨Sy⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩.\n\n⟨Sy⟩ = (⟨χ|/5) * S_y * (|χ⟩/5)\n⟨Sy⟩ = (1/25) * ⟨χ|S_y|χ⟩\n⟨Sy⟩ = (1/25) * [-3i, 4] * ((ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]) * [3i, 4]\n\nLet's first compute the result of S_y acting on |χ⟩:\n(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4] = (ħ/2) * [(-i * 4), (i * 3i)] = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]\n\nNow, multiply by the bra vector ⟨χ|:\n⟨Sy⟩ = (1/25) * [-3i, 4] * ((ħ/2) * [-4i, -3])\n⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]\n⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [(-3i * -4i) + (4 * -3)]\n⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [12i² - 12]\n⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-12 - 12]\n⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/50) * [-24]\n⟨Sy⟩ = -24ħ/50 = -12ħ/25.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
