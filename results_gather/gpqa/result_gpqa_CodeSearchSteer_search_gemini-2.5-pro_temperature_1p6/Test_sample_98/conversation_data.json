    "### Decoding the Spectra: Identification of an Unknown Compound\n\nAn unknown compound has been identified as **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** based on detailed analysis of its Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra. The spectroscopic data provided crucial clues to piece together the molecule's structure from four possibilities.\n\nThe initial analysis of the FTIR spectrum pointed towards a carboxylic acid functional group. A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer, and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, indicative of a C=O carbonyl stretch, were both observed. While this confirmed the presence of a COOH group, all four potential compounds contained this feature.\n\nThe definitive evidence came from the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The problem states that the spectrum contains a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a separate signal that is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. These complex multiplets arise when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent neighboring protons. The key was to find the structure where specific protons would exhibit these exact splitting patterns.\n\nA systematic analysis of each possible structure revealed that only option C, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, could produce both of these unique signals.\n\nLet's break down the splitting for structure C:\n**CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂(c)CH₃(d))-CH(e)(CH₂(f)CH₃(g))-CH₂(h)-COOH(i)**\n\n1.  **The Doublet of Triplets of Quartets (dtq):**\n    This signal corresponds to the proton labeled **H(b)**. Its splitting is determined by its neighbors:\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(e)** on the adjacent carbon, which splits its signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   It is also coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** in its ethyl substituent, resulting in a **triplet**.\n    *   Finally, it couples with the three protons of its own methyl group **CH₃(a)**, causing a **quartet**.\n    The combination of these couplings results in a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n2.  **The Doublet of Triplets of Triplets (dtt):**\n    This signal can be attributed to the proton labeled **H(e)**. Its splitting pattern is governed by its neighboring protons:\n    *   Coupling to the single proton **H(b)** on the neighboring chiral center splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   It couples to the two protons of the adjacent methylene group **CH₂(h)** in the main chain, which creates a **triplet**.\n    *   It also couples to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(f)** within its ethyl substituent, resulting in another **triplet**.\n    Thus, the signal for H(e) is a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\nThe other candidate structures were eliminated because they could not account for both of these specific and complex splitting patterns simultaneously. For example, structure A contains a proton that could be a doublet of triplets of quartets, but lacks a proton that would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets. Structures B and D do not have protons that would generate the required splitting patterns at all.\n\nThis detailed examination of the ¹H NMR splitting, combined with the confirmatory evidence from the FTIR data, unequivocally identifies the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
