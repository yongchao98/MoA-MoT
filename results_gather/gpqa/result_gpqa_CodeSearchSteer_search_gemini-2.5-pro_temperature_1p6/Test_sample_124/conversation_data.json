    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level is:\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, n=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   One quantum of energy in one mode and two in another: (2, 1, 0) and its 5 other permutations (e.g., (1, 2, 0), (0, 1, 2), etc.). This gives 6 states.\n*   Three quanta of energy in a single mode: (3, 0, 0) and its 2 other permutations ((0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)). This gives 3 states.\n*   One quantum of energy in each of the three modes: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: 6 + 3 + 1 = 10.\n\nBased on the calculations, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$ and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
