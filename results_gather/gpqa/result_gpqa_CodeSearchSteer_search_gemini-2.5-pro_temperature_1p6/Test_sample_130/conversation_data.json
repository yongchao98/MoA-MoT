    "This problem describes a classic Diels-Alder reaction and uses 2D NMR spectroscopy to distinguish between the resulting stereoisomers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks (137 ppm and 165 ppm). This perfectly describes **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent alkene protons give the single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons give the two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder) between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction is known to produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **major product** is the kinetically favored *endo* adduct, where the anhydride portion is tucked under the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The **minor product** is the thermodynamically more stable *exo* adduct, where the anhydride portion is oriented away from the ring system.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the NMR Spectra and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates that the corresponding protons are in close spatial proximity.\n    *   We are looking for a key spatial relationship that exists in the major (*endo*) product but is absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   Let's predict the chemical shifts of the protons in the product:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** These are the two protons from the original maleic anhydride. In the product, they are attached to sp³ carbons that are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift is expected to be deshielded, around **~3.5 ppm**. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in a singlet that integrates to **2H**.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the product. Their chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyls, around **~1.7 ppm**. Since there are two such equivalent methyl groups, this will be a singlet integrating to **6H**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are more shielded and appear further upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**. This will also be a 6H singlet.\n    *   **Spatial Relationships (The Key to NOESY):**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are on the concave face of the bicyclic system. This geometry places them very close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two sets of protons.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are on the convex face, pointing away from the rest of the ring structure. They are now distant from the vinylic methyl groups. Consequently, the NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the anhydride protons with the vinylic methyl protons. Based on our chemical shift predictions:\n    *   The anhydride protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinylic methyl protons are the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
