    "The problem asks for the maximum speed ($v_{max}$) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. To solve this, we can use the principle of conservation of energy, adapted for special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Total Relativistic Energy**: For a particle in a potential $U(x)$, the total energy $E$ is the sum of its rest energy ($mc^2$), its relativistic kinetic energy, and its potential energy. The total energy can be expressed as:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, $v$ is the speed, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy**: The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The corresponding potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy $E$ of the oscillator is conserved. We can evaluate the energy at two critical points of the motion: at the maximum amplitude and at the equilibrium position.\n\n4.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**:\n    *   At the point of maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   This makes the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is therefore: $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n5.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**:\n    *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is: $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Equating Energies**: Since the total energy is conserved, we can set the expressions for the total energy at the two points equal to each other:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n7.  **Solve for $v_{max}$**:\n    *   First, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$. Recall that $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Let's rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Isolate the velocity term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    *   Solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n    *   Finally, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into this equation:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
