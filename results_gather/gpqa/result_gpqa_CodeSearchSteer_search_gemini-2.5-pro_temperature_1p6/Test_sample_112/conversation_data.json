    "To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data will be analyzed step-by-step.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range (1690-1760 cm⁻¹) for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl protons are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This fragment is often observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids. Another possibility for m/z 45 is the [C2H5O]⁺ fragment from an ether or ethanol, but this is less consistent with the strong FTIR evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas:\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid, a molecule containing both a C=C double bond and a -COOH group. This structure requires a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 2 (one for the C=C bond and one for the C=O bond).\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the given formulas: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This degree of unsaturation does not account for both a C=C and a C=O double bond.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This fits the evidence perfectly, allowing for one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This formula also contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This has an insufficient degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. While the degree of unsaturation is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data are all consistent with a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only molecular formula that accommodates a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is C6H10O2, with a degree of unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
