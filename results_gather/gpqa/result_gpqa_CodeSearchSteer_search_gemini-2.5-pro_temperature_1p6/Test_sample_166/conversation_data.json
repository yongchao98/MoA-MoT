    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Understand the Non-Gaussianity Measure\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity (`del_b` or `nG`) is defined as the relative entropy between the given state `rho` and its corresponding reference Gaussian state `tau`. The reference Gaussian state `tau` is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as `rho`.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n`del_b = S(rho || tau) = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(rho * ln(tau))`\n\nA key property of relative entropy for this purpose is that it simplifies to the difference in von Neumann entropies:\n`del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\nwhere `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho))` is the von Neumann entropy of the state `rho`.\n\n### 2. Simplify the Expression for a Pure State\nThe given Schrödinger cat state `|psi>` is a pure state.\n*   `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N`\nThe density matrix for a pure state is `rho = |psi><psi|`.\nThe von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\n*   `S(rho) = S(|psi><psi|) = 0`\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n*   `del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau)`\n\n### 3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`\nWe need to find the first and second moments of `rho` to define `tau`.\n\n**Given parameters:**\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n\n**State properties:**\n*   `cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n*   The normalization constant squared is `N^2 = 1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-2 * 0.5^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5)`.\n*   The state becomes an odd cat state: `|psi> = ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-0.5)))`.\n\n**First Moment (Displacement):**\nThe displacement is `d = <a> = <psi|a|psi>`. For this specific state with `phi = -pi/4`, the displacement is:\n*   `<a> = (alpha/N^2) * cos(2*phi) = (0.5 / N^2) * cos(-pi/2) = 0`.\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` has zero displacement.\n\n**Second Moments:**\nWe need to calculate `<a^2>` and `<a^\\dagger a>`.\n*   `<a^2> = (alpha^2 / N^2) * [1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)] = (0.25 / (1 - exp(-0.5))) * [1 - 1*exp(-0.5)] = 0.25`.\n*   `<a^\\dagger a> = (alpha^2 / N^2) * [1 - sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)] = (0.25 / (1 - exp(-0.5))) * [1 + 1*exp(-0.5)]`. This is the average photon number, let's call it `n`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau` depends on the symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`, of its covariance matrix `V`.\n*   `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is the square root of the determinant of the covariance matrix, `nu = sqrt(det(V))`. For a zero-displacement state, the determinant is given by:\n*   `det(V) = (<a^\\dagger a> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2 = (n + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n*   `alpha = 0.5`, `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653`\n*   `n = 0.25 * (1 + 0.60653) / (1 - 0.60653) ≈ 0.25 * (1.60653 / 0.39347) ≈ 1.02074`\n*   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n\nNow we calculate `det(V)`:\n*   `det(V) = (1.02074 + 0.5)^2 - |0.25|^2 = (1.52074)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31266 - 0.0625 = 2.25016`\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is:\n*   `nu = sqrt(2.25016) ≈ 1.5`\n\nFinally, we calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n*   `del_b = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n*   `del_b = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `del_b = 2 * ln(2) - 0` (since `ln(1) = 0`)\n*   `del_b = 2 * 0.6931... ≈ 1.386`\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
