    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The radial velocity method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in the wavelength of a spectral line (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (v_r) of the star along the line of sight. The maximum observed wavelength shift (the amplitude of the shift, Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K).\n\n    The relationship is given by:\n    Δλ / λ = v_r / c\n    Therefore, K ∝ Δλ_max.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Stellar Velocity Amplitudes**\n    We are given the periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ_max1 = 5 milliangstrom\n    *   Δλ_max2 = 7 milliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity Amplitude to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) can be expressed as:\n\n    K = [ (2πG) / P ]^(1/3) * [ (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3) ]\n\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n    *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Ratio for the Two Systems**\n    We can write the equation for each system and then take their ratio:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = { [ (2πG) / P₂ ]^(1/3) * [ (m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / M_star2^(2/3) ] } / { [ (2πG) / P₁ ]^(1/3) * [ (m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / M_star1^(2/3) ] }\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio**\n    The problem provides the following information:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n\n    Although the inclinations (i₁ and i₂) are unknown, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the viewing conditions are comparable, so we assume sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).\n\n    With these simplifications, the terms for mass (m_p and M_star), inclination (sin(i)), and the constant (2πG) cancel out, leaving:\n\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (1 / P₂) ]^(1/3) / [ (1 / P₁) ]^(1/3)\n    K₂ / K₁ = ( P₁ / P₂ )^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Solve for the Orbital Period Ratio**\n    We now substitute the calculated value of K₂ / K₁ = 1.4 into the simplified equation:\n\n    1.4 = ( P₁ / P₂ )^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio P₁ / P₂, we cube both sides:\n\n    P₁ / P₂ = (1.4)³ = 1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 2.744\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We can find this by taking the reciprocal of our result:\n\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / (P₁ / P₂) = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    The calculated ratio P₂ / P₁ is approximately 0.3644. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
