    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes, we first need to establish the relationship between parallax and distance, and then use the given information about how the number of stars varies with parallax.\n\n### 1. Relationship between Distance and Parallax\n\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This fundamental relationship is given by the formula:\n\n`r = 1 / plx`\n\nHere, `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax angle in arcseconds. This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice-versa.\n\n### 2. Number of Stars per Unit Distance\n\nThe problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". In astronomical contexts, this typically refers to the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as dN/d(plx), where N is the number of stars.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\nThe question asks for how the number of stars changes with distance *per unit range of distance*, which is the quantity dN/dr. To find this, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\nThis type of conversion between distributions is a standard technique in astronomy, often involving a Jacobian transformation.\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nFirst, let's find the term `d(plx)/dr`. Starting from the relation `plx = 1/r`, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n\n`d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases, which is expected. When considering the density of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of this change, so we use the absolute value:\n\n`|d(plx)/dr| ∝ 1/r²` or `r⁻²`\n\nNow, we substitute everything into the chain rule formula. We need to express all terms as a function of `r`:\n\n*   We are given: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n*   Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `plx⁻⁵ ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`.\n*   We just found: `|d(plx)/dr| ∝ r⁻²`.\n\nMultiplying these proportionalities gives:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (r⁻²) = r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance `r` varies as `r³`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
