    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of approximately 1/3 (32%) are characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of all four possible compounds is ~156 g/mol, consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features:\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, effectively ruling out options B (an aldehyde) and C (an acid chloride derivative).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:** The NMR data provides the final clues to pinpoint the exact isomer:\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** (integrating to 1H) is in the typical chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for a highly deshielded carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two doublets at **8.02 ppm** (2H) and **7.72 ppm** (2H) are indicative of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* arrangement creates two sets of equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its neighbor. This pattern is a fingerprint for 1,4 substitution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid (D)** fits all the spectral data. It is a carboxylic acid, it contains one chlorine atom, its molecular weight is 156.57, and its *para* substitution pattern matches the 1H NMR spectrum perfectly. 2-chlorobenzoic acid (A) would show a much more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
