    "The search results confirm my reasoning. Several sources mention that for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass can be determined from the period and the radial velocity amplitudes. Specifically, source states that for an eclipsing binary, the inclination `i` can be determined, which breaks the degeneracy and allows for the determination of individual masses. As the problem describes eclipsing binaries, assuming an inclination of 90 degrees (sin(i)=1) is a standard and valid approach. The mass ratio is given by m1/m2 = K2/K1, and the total mass involves the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K1+K2). The key relationship is derived from Kepler's third law.\n\nMy derived formula for the ratio of the total masses appears correct:\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ( (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) )^3\n\nThe calculation was:\nM1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * ( (10 + 5) / (15 + 10) )^3\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)^3\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This means it is less massive than system_2. The question asks \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2\", and since the factor is less than 1, it implies it is less massive.\n\nThe calculation and the underlying physics principles are sound. The result robustly points towards ~0.4.\n\nFinal check of the question and my interpretation.\n- \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" asks for the ratio M1/M2.\n- My calculation yielded M1/M2 ≈ 0.432.\n- This is closest to option A.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Identify the relationship between total mass (M), orbital period (P), and radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) for a double-lined eclipsing binary system. The key formula is that M is proportional to P * (K1+K2)^3.\n2.  Set up the ratio M1/M2, which eliminates the physical constants.\n3.  Plug in the given values for periods and velocity amplitudes for both systems.\n4.  Calculate the final numerical value.\n5.  Compare the result to the given options.\n\nAll steps have been completed and checked. I am confident in the result.To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2).\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) by the following equation, derived from Kepler's third law:\n\nM = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations for the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the orbital inclination (the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, and therefore sin(i) is approximately 1.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the masses of the two systems. The constant term (2πG) and the sin³(i) term (assuming it's 1 for both) will cancel out.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio M₁ / M₂. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s, as the units will cancel out.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
