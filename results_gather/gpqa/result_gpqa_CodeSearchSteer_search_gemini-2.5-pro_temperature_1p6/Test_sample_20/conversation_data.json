    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structures that are readily interconvertible. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) that can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In p-benzoquinone, the carbon atoms of the carbonyl groups (C=O) are bonded to carbons that are part of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). These adjacent carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because p-benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms adjacent to these carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups and therefore have α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to exhibit tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to its aromaticity and is the predominant tautomer.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is typically chiral if it contains a **chiral center**, which is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. Such molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (–H)\n    3.  A methyl group (–CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (–COOCH₃)\n\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is optically active and exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R) and (S) forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, is the *trans* isomer of a diester. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. As an achiral molecule, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. It is, however, a geometric isomer (a diastereomer) of dimethyl maleate.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **(A)** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **(B)** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
