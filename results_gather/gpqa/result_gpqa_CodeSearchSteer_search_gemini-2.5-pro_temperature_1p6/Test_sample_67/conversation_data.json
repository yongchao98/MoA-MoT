    "The physical process described is known as Larmor precession. When the magnetic field is switched from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, the particle's spin, which was initially aligned with the Z-axis, begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: At time t=0, the particle's spin is aligned with the +Z direction. The state vector is `|+z>`, which is the eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction, `S_z`, with an eigenvalue of `+ħ/2`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: For t ≥ 0, the magnetic field is `B` in the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ · B = -γS_yB`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator in the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, can be found to evolve in time as:\n    `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n    This calculation shows that the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field (Y-axis).\n\n4.  **Larmor Precession**: This precession of the spin vector around the magnetic field is called Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. For a magnetic field `B`, the angular frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component**: As the spin vector precesses in the XZ-plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis oscillates. The initial state is entirely on the Z-axis, so the expectation value `<S_z>(t)` will oscillate between its maximum value `+ħ/2` and its minimum value `-ħ/2`. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe detailed calculation confirms this:\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the spin evolves as: `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Since the z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`, its expectation value also oscillates: `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nThe oscillation is described by the term `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency `ω` is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
