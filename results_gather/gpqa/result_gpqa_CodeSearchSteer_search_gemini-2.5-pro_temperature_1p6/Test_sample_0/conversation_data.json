    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This fundamental limit is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of a quantum state is inversely related to its lifetime (τ) by the formula:\n\n**ΔE ≈ ħ / τ**\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolvable, their energy separation must be significantly larger than these calculated energy uncertainties. The first state has the shorter lifetime and therefore the larger energy width (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), which is the dominant factor for distinguishability.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy width of both states.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also significantly smaller than the energy widths.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is the smallest option and thus not resolvable.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is about 1,000 times larger than the broader energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) of the two states.\n\nAn energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is substantially greater than the natural energy widths of both states, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
