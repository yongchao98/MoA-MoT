    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of a system with four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) = n²E\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level *n* and the spin projection (spin up or spin down). Therefore, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Energy Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 x E₁ = 2 x (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Energy Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 x E₂ = 2 x (2²E) = 2 x 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   **Energy Level n=1:** Still holds two particles. Energy = 2E.\n*   **Energy Level n=2:** Now holds only one particle. Energy = 1 x E₂ = 1 x (2²E) = 4E.\n*   **Energy Level n=3:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 x E₃ = 1 x (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider the different ways to excite the system from the ground state.\n*   **Option 1: Promote a second particle from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: 2 x E₁ + 2 x E₃ = 2 x (1²E) + 2 x (3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Option 2: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy: 1 x E₁ + 2 x E₂ + 1 x E₃ = 1 x (1²E) + 2 x (2²E) + 1 x (3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Option 3: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy: 2 x E₁ + 1 x E₂ + 1 x E₄ = 2 x (1²E) + 1 x (2²E) + 1 x (4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
