    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we must calculate its total relativistic energy.\n\nThe nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 protons and, as specified, 3 neutrons. This makes it the isotope Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is given by the equation:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_0$ is the rest mass of the nucleus.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, calculated as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**1. Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\nGiven the speed v = 0.96c:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$) of the Nucleus**\nA precise calculation would use the nuclide mass of Lithium-6, which is 6.0134771 atomic mass units (u). However, comparing this calculation to the provided options suggests an approximation is used. The most plausible method that aligns with the given options is to approximate the nucleus's mass as the sum of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons), using the mass of a neutron as the average nucleon mass.\n\n*   Number of nucleons in $^{6}$Li = 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.\n*   The rest energy of a neutron is approximately 939.565 MeV.\n\nApproximated rest energy of the $^{6}$Li nucleus:\n$E_0 \\approx 6 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV}$\n$E_0 \\approx 5637.39 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\nNow, we combine the Lorentz factor and the approximated rest energy:\n$E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n$E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5637.39 \\text{ MeV}$\n$E \\approx 20133.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Convert to GeV**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert the energy to GeV:\n$E \\approx \\frac{20133.5}{1000} \\text{ GeV}$\n$E \\approx 20.1335 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is extremely close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
