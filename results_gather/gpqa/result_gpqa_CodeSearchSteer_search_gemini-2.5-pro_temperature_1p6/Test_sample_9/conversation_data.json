    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze the options based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, essentially representing Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For rocky planets with the same composition, density increases with mass. This is because the stronger gravity of a more massive planet compresses the material more tightly. Therefore, a planet that is 5 times the mass of Earth but made of the same \"stuff\" will be significantly denser than Earth due to this gravitational compression.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with a smaller mass will have weaker gravity and therefore less compression. Its density will be lower than that of an Earth-mass planet with the same composition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the scenarios:\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) will have a density significantly *greater* than 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n*   Planet (d) will have a density *less* than 5.51 g/cm³ due to lower gravitational compression.\n\nThus, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass will have the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
