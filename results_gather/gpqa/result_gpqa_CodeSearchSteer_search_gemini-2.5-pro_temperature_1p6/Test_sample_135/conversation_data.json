    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f**(r) over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field is given by its magnitude f(r) = 1/r² and is directed radially outward. In spherical coordinates, this can be expressed as **f** = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nTo solve this, we need to evaluate ∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV.\n\nThere are two primary methods to approach this problem:\n\n### Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states:\n\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ **f** ⋅ d**S**\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R. The differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n\nThe vector field **f** on the surface of the sphere (where r = R) is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n\nNow, we can compute the surface integral (the flux):\n\n∮ₛ **f** ⋅ d**S** = ∫₀²π ∫₀π ( (1/R²) **r̂** ) ⋅ ( R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂** )\n\nThe dot product **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** is 1, and the R² terms cancel out:\n\n= ∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n\n= (∫₀²π dφ) × (∫₀π sin(θ) dθ)\n= [φ]₀²π × [-cos(θ)]₀π\n= (2π - 0) × (-cos(π) - (-cos(0)))\n= 2π × (-(-1) - (-1))\n= 2π × (1 + 1)\n= 4π\n\nA crucial point is that the vector field **f** = (1/r²) **r̂** has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where it is undefined. The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be continuously differentiable throughout the volume. However, by excluding a small sphere around the origin and applying the theorem to the remaining volume, it can be shown that the flux through the outer sphere is equal to the flux through the inner sphere, leading to the same result. The singularity at the origin acts as a \"source of divergence\".\n\n### Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nThe divergence of the vector field **f** = (1/r²) **r̂** can be calculated directly using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a field with only a radial component Fᵣ, the divergence is ∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² Fᵣ)/∂r.\n\nHere, Fᵣ = 1/r².\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence is zero everywhere *except* at the origin (r=0), where the field is not defined. The divergence at the origin is infinite. This type of function is described by the Dirac delta function. The divergence of this specific field is known to be:\n\n∇ ⋅ ( **r̂** / r² ) = 4πδ³(**r**)\n\nwhere δ³(**r**) is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, which is zero everywhere except at **r**=0, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the volume integral:\n\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∫ᵥ 4πδ³(**r**) dV\n\nSince the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin, it contains the point **r**=0. Therefore, the integral evaluates to:\n\n= 4π ∫ᵥ δ³(**r**) dV = 4π × 1 = 4π.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
