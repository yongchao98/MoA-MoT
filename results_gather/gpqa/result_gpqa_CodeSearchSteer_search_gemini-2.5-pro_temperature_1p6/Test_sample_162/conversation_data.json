    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum amount of a strong monobasic acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a final volume of 100 cm³, and determine the pH of this final solution.\n\n**1. Molar Mass and Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved. The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is the sum of the atomic masses of its elements:\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.867 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.867 g/mol ≈ 9.357 × 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\n**2. Dissolution Reaction and Stoichiometry**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds according to the following net ionic equation:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 3 moles of H⁺ are consumed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃ that dissolves.\n*   Moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 × (9.357 × 10⁻⁴ moles) ≈ 2.807 × 10⁻³ moles.\n\n**3. Equilibrium and Final pH**\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be considered \"dissolved\", the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must not exceed the solubility product constant (Ksp). To find the minimum acid required, we assume the system is at equilibrium (saturated). The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 4 x 10⁻³⁸, though values can range.\n\nFirst, we find the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 × 10⁻⁴ moles) / 0.1 L = 9.357 × 10⁻³ M.\n\nNext, we use the Ksp to find the maximum allowed hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   4 × 10⁻³⁸ = (9.357 × 10⁻³ M) × [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (4 × 10⁻³⁸) / (9.357 × 10⁻³) ≈ 4.275 × 10⁻³⁶ M³\n*   [OH⁻] = (4.275 × 10⁻³⁶)¹/³ ≈ 1.623 × 10⁻¹² M.\n\nNow, we can find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] and the pH of the resulting solution using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n*   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.623 × 10⁻¹²) ≈ 6.162 × 10⁻³ M.\n*   pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(6.162 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.21.\n\nThis pH value does not match any of the options closely. Let's re-evaluate using a different Ksp value from another source. A Ksp of 6 x 10⁻³⁸ is also commonly cited.\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (6 × 10⁻³⁸) / (9.357 × 10⁻³) ≈ 6.412 × 10⁻³⁶ M³\n*   [OH⁻] = (6.412 × 10⁻³⁶)¹/³ ≈ 1.858 × 10⁻¹² M.\n*   [H⁺] = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.858 × 10⁻¹²) ≈ 5.382 × 10⁻³ M.\n*   pH = -log₁₀(5.382 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.27.\n\nThis pH is still not matching. Let's analyze the problem from the perspective of the given answers. The pH values in the options (2.04, 2.69, 3.16, 4.94) suggest a specific equilibrium condition. Let's test the pH from option C.\n\nIf the final pH is 2.04:\n*   [H⁺]final = 10⁻².⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 × 10⁻³ M.\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution = (9.12 × 10⁻³ mol/L) × 0.1 L = 9.12 × 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\n**4. Total Acid Required**\nThe total amount of acid that must be added is the sum of the acid that reacted with Fe(OH)₃ and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the required pH.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = Moles of H⁺ reacted + Moles of H⁺ remaining.\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = (2.807 × 10⁻³ moles) + (9.12 × 10⁻⁴ moles) = 3.719 × 10⁻³ moles.\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this amount of H⁺:\n*   Volume = Total moles / Molarity = (3.719 × 10⁻³ moles) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03719 L.\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.03719 L × 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (37.19 cm³) is not close to the 28.05 cm³ in option C. There seems to be a discrepancy in the problem statement, the provided options, or the standard Ksp values.\n\nLet's re-calculate by forcing the volume from option C and seeing what pH it yields.\n\nIf Volume = 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L):\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.02805 L * 0.1 mol/L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ moles.\n*   We know from stoichiometry that 2.807 × 10⁻³ moles of H⁺ are required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃. The amount of acid provided in option C (2.805 × 10⁻³ moles) is almost exactly the amount needed for the stoichiometric reaction, leaving virtually no excess H⁺ to lower the pH. This would imply a final pH close to 7, which contradicts the acidic pH values given.\n\nThere appears to be an inconsistency in the question's parameters. However, if we must choose the best option, we can work backward from the provided answers. The calculation that yields a pH and volume pair closest to one of the options should be considered the intended answer. Let's try to match option C (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³) as it's a common pattern for these problems to have a correct numerical pairing, even if based on slightly different standard values.\n\nLet's assume the moles of H+ added from option C (2.805 x 10⁻³ mol) is incorrect, but the pH is correct.\npH = 2.04 -> [H+] = 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n[OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁴ / 9.12 x 10⁻³ = 1.096 x 10⁻¹² M\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (0.009357)(1.096 x 10⁻¹²)³ = 1.23 x 10⁻⁴⁴. This is far from the accepted Ksp.\n\nLet's assume the volume from option C (28.05 cm³) is correct.\nMoles H+ added = 0.02805 L * 0.1 M = 0.002805 moles.\nMoles H+ reacted = 0.002807 moles.\nThis is essentially a 1:1 match, leaving no excess acid. This would mean the solution is not acidic, contradicting all pH values.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, there is likely an error in the problem statement or options. However, let's re-examine the moles calculation. Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 / 106.867 = 0.0009357 mol. Moles H+ required for reaction = 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol. This requires 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid just for the neutralization. This is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ in option C. If we accept this volume, the remaining H+ is negligible, and the final pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. This hydrolysis (Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺ + H₃O⁺) would result in an acidic pH. The Ka for Fe³⁺(aq) is about 6.3 x 10⁻³. Calculating the pH from this hydrolysis is complex but would result in an acidic solution. It's plausible that the question intended this path. If we assume the 28.05 cm³ is the correct volume, the resulting pH would be acidic. The closest pH value given is 2.04.\n\nFinal check of logic:\n1. Moles H+ needed for reaction: ~28.07 cm³. Option C provides 28.05 cm³. This is a near-perfect match.\n2. At this volume, all added H+ is consumed by the OH- from Fe(OH)₃.\n3. The resulting solution contains Fe³⁺ ions.\n4. The Fe³⁺ ion hydrolyzes water to produce H₃O⁺, making the solution acidic.\n5. Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n6. Using Ka for Fe³⁺ (~6.3x10⁻³) and the concentration of Fe³⁺ (0.009357 M), we can estimate the pH.\n   Ka = [H⁺]² / ([Fe³⁺] - [H⁺]). Approximating, [H⁺] ≈ sqrt(Ka * [Fe³⁺]) = sqrt(6.3x10⁻³ * 0.009357) ≈ sqrt(5.9x10⁻⁵) ≈ 0.00768 M.\n   pH = -log(0.00768) ≈ 2.11.\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.11 is very close to the 2.04 provided in option C. This line of reasoning provides the most self-consistent result among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
