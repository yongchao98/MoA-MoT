    "### Calculation of the Silicon Abundance Ratio in Two Stars\n\nTo determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we will utilize the provided elemental abundances, which are expressed in the standard astronomical dex notation. This notation, [X/Y], compares the logarithm of the abundance ratio of two elements (X and Y) in a star to the same ratio in the Sun.\n\nThe formula is defined as:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀(Nₓ/Nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(Nₓ/Nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nWhere Nₓ and Nᵧ represent the number of atoms of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nThe abundances can be related using the following property:\n[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]\n\n**For Star 1:**\nWe are given:\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex\n\nWe need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, [Si/H]₁. Using the property mentioned above:\n[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁\n[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex\n\nThis means:\nlog₁₀(n_Si/n_H)₁ - log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun = 0.3\nlog₁₀(n_Si/n_H)₁ = 0.3 + log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun\n(n_Si/n_H)₁ = 10⁰·³ * (n_Si/n_H)_sun\n\n**For Star 2:**\nWe are given:\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex\n\nWe can relate these abundances to find [Si/H]₂:\n[Mg/H]₂ = [Mg/Si]₂ + [Si/H]₂\n0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]₂\n[Si/H]₂ = -0.3 dex\n\nThis implies:\nlog₁₀(n_Si/n_H)₂ - log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun = -0.3\nlog₁₀(n_Si/n_H)₂ = -0.3 + log₁₀(n_Si/n_H)_sun\n(n_Si/n_H)₂ = 10⁻⁰·³ * (n_Si/n_H)_sun\n\n**Ratio Calculation:**\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres is the ratio of their number densities relative to hydrogen, (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂.\n\nRatio = [10⁰·³ * (n_Si/n_H)_sun] / [10⁻⁰·³ * (n_Si/n_H)_sun]\nRatio = 10⁰·³ / 10⁻⁰·³\nRatio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))\nRatio = 10⁰·⁶\n\nCalculating the value of 10⁰·⁶:\n10⁰·⁶ ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The masses of the stars and the specific solar abundance values for Fe and Mg were not required for the final calculation, as the terms canceled out. The calculation relies solely on the interpretation of the bracket notation for elemental abundances.\n\nThus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2 is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
