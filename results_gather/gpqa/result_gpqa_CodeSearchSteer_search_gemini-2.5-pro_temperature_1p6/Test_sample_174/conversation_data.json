    "An oscillating charge distribution, such as a spheroid, acts as an electric dipole. The radiated power from such a dipole has a specific dependence on the angle of observation and the wavelength of the radiation.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It follows a `sin²(θ)` relationship, where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case). The formula is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum power, `A`, is radiated at `θ = 90°`, where `sin²(90°) = 1`. This corresponds to the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we calculate `sin²(30°)`.\n*   `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n*   `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power, `A`.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is related to the frequency (and thus, wavelength) of the oscillation. The total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` (`P ∝ ω⁴`). Since the angular frequency `ω` is inversely proportional to the wavelength `λ` (`ω = 2πc/λ`), the radiated power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is a hallmark of electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh scattering, and it explains, for instance, why the sky appears blue, as shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths. The radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, will also follow this dependence.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4, and the possible form of the function `f` for the radiated power per unit solid angle includes a `λ⁻⁴` term.\n\n<<<D>>>"
