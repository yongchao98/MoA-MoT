    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Compound X from IR and NMR Data**\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This wide absorption band is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons, indicating a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons, indicating a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2 protons, likely a methylene group (-CH₂) with multiple different neighbors.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1 proton, likely a benzylic proton (a C-H group attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\n**Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\nThe signals for the alkyl group are consistent with a *sec*-butyl group (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring.\n*   The benzylic proton is the -CH at 2.9 ppm.\n*   It is attached to a methyl group (doublet at 1.4 ppm) and a methylene group.\n*   The methylene group (-CH₂-) appears as a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.\n*   This methylene group is attached to a terminal methyl group (triplet at 0.9 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:**\nCombining all the spectral data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: The Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. When a carboxylic acid is treated with red P and HI, the entire carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is:\nR-COOH + 6HI (in presence of red P) → R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 is an alkane group and will not be affected by the reaction conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe calculated final product matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
