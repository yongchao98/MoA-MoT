    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the observable `P` when the system is in the state represented by the column matrix `(-1, 2, 1)`. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Normalize the State Vector**\n\nFirst, we normalize the given state vector `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ`.\nThe squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ`\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\n\nNext, we find the eigenvalues of the operator `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\nThe matrix `P` is:\n```\n| 0      1/√2    0    |\n| 1/√2    0      1/√2 |\n| 0      1/√2    0    |\n```\nThe characteristic equation is:\n`det | -λ   1/√2    0    |`\n`    | 1/√2  -λ     1/√2 | = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n`    | 0    1/√2   -λ    |`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**\n\nNow, we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\nLet `|v₀⟩ = (x, y, z)ᵀ`.\n```\n| 0    1/√2   0    | |x|   |0|\n| 1/√2  0    1/√2  | |y| = |0|\n| 0    1/√2   0    | |z|   |0|\n```\nThis gives the system of equations:\n*   `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n*   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `(x, 0, -x)ᵀ`. We can choose `x = 1` to get an unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀_un⟩ = (1, 0, -1)ᵀ`.\n\n**4. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nWe normalize the eigenvector `|v₀_un⟩`.\nThe squared norm is:\n`⟨v₀_un|v₀_un⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\n\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is:\n`|v₀⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)ᵀ`\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is `P(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\nFirst, we compute the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) ] · [ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1) ]`\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ]`\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, we square the magnitude to find the probability:\n`P(0) = | -1/√3 |² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
