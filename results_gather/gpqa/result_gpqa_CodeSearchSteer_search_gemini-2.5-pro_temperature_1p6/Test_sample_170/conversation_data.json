    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and properties of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, the substituents are classified based on their directing effects for electrophilic substitution:\n*   **Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. Generally, these are activating groups (electron-donating).\n    *   **1) -CH3 (methyl):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (ethyl):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **3) -Cl (chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. These are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   **4) -NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **6) -COOH (benzoic acid):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nNext, we evaluate the expected yield of the para-isomer for each substance:\n\n**Meta-Directing Substances:**\nFor substances with meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inherently very low. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the lower the formation of ortho and para products.\n*   **4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with the para-isomer yield being extremely low (around 0.2%).\n*   **2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5) and 6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH):** Both the ester and carboxylic acid groups are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. The para-isomer yields are very small. For nitration of ethyl benzoate (a similar electrophilic substitution), the para yield is about 5%. For bromination, we expect similarly low yields. Theoretical calculations and experimental data show that for deactivating groups like these, the meta product is highly favored. The para yield for ethyl benzoate bromination is typically around 6%. The para yield for benzoic acid bromination is generally reported to be very low, often just a few percent. Based on the relative deactivating strengths (-NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5), the order of increasing para yield is expected to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate.\n\n**Ortho/Para-Directing Substances:**\nFor substances with ortho/para-directing groups, a significant portion of the product will be the para-isomer. The ratio between ortho and para isomers is primarily influenced by steric hindrance.\n*   **1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3):** The methyl group is relatively small. In bromination, the para-isomer is favored over the ortho-isomer. Reported yields for the para-isomer are around 67%.\n*   **5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer. Therefore, the para-isomer yield for ethylbenzene should be greater than that for toluene.\n*   **3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl):** Halogens are deactivating overall but direct ortho/para. The para isomer is significantly favored in the bromination of chlorobenzene. Typical yields for para-bromochlorobenzene are very high, often around 87-89%. Some specialized catalytic methods can push this selectivity even higher.\n\n**Consolidated Order:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can establish the following order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Extremely low para yield (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Very low para yield (a few percent).\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Low para yield (around 6%).\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Significant para yield (~67%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** High para yield (higher than toluene due to sterics).\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Very high para yield (~89%).\n\nThus, the final order from lowest to highest weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
