    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can follow these steps based on the provided data. The fundamental principle is that the enthalpy of formation of a compound from its elements in their standard state is equal to the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements minus the total bond energies of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the bonds.**\n\nThe chemical structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH3) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH3) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n*   **Bond Counting:**\n    *   C-H bonds: There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   C=C bonds: There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH=**C(CH3)2**. This gives **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   C-C bonds: The total number of bonds between the 12 carbon atoms in this non-cyclic structure is 11. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.**\n\nThis value represents the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol.\n*   **Total bond energy** = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the constituent elements.**\n\nThe elements are 12 moles of carbon and 22 moles of hydrogen atoms (from 11 moles of H2 gas).\n*   Enthalpy of atomization for Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**.\n*   Enthalpy of atomization for Hydrogen: We are given the bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. To form 22 moles of H atoms, we need to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**.\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of elements** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f).**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy required to atomize the elements minus the energy released when forming the compound's bonds (which is the total bond energy).\n*   ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the answer to the required units.**\n\nThe options include units of kJ/g. We need to convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
