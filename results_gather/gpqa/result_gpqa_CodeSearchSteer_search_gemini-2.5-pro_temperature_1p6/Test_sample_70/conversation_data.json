    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods (P) for five planets: P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    We are interested in the ratio of the periods of Planet\\_4 (P₄) and Planet\\_2 (P₂).\n    From the given ratio, P₄/P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance (d).\n    P² ∝ d³\n    We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    (P₄/P₂)² = (d₄/d₂ )³\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances:**\n    Substitute the known ratio of the periods into the equation:\n    (1.75)² = (d₄/d₂ )³\n    3.0625 = (d₄/d₂ )³\n    To find the ratio of the distances (d₄/d₂), we take the cube root of both sides:\n    d₄/d₂ = (3.0625)^(1/3) ≈ 1.452\n\n4.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. This energy is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. The temperature is related to this energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, resulting in the following proportionality (assuming the albedo is the same for both planets):\n    T_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = d^(-1/2)\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet\\_4 and Planet\\_2 is:\n    T_eq₄ / T_eq₂ = (d₂/d₄)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    We know d₄/d₂ ≈ 1.452, so d₂/d₄ ≈ 1 / 1.452 ≈ 0.6887.\n    Now substitute this value into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq₄ / T_eq₂ = (0.6887)^(1/2) ≈ 0.8299\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
