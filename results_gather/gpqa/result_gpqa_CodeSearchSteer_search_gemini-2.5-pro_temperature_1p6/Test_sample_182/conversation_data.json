    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its IHD\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO group (an aldehyde).\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C₁₀H₁₂O₃, the IHD is:\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the rings and π bonds in the structure:\n*   One ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the vinyl group: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the formyl group: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group: IHD = 1\n*   **Total IHD = 5**\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is capable of reducing several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are completely reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product and its IHD\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the reducible functional groups in the starting molecule:\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nThe original carbon skeleton consists of 10 carbon atoms, and this number does not change during the reduction. All oxygen atoms are removed. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents: 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (the exact numbering depends on IUPAC rules, but the molecular structure is what matters).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double and triple bonds have been saturated, the only feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency (compared to a non-cyclic alkane) is the ring itself. The molecular formula for a substituted cycloalkane is CnH2n. With 10 carbon atoms, the formula for our product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
