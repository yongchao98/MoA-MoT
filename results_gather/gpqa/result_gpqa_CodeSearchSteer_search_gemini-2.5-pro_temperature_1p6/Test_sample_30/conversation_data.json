    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the final product and its molecular symmetry group:\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically, the nitration of toluene. The combination of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and directs electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the major product formed is *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene). This is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*p*-Nitrotoluene is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation reaction. MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent that can oxidize the benzylic methyl group. While very strong oxidizing agents convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is often used for the selective oxidation of benzylic carbons to the aldehyde stage. Therefore, **Product 2** is *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. In some cases, MnO₂ in the presence of H₂SO₄ and HNO₃ can lead to dinitrobenzaldehyde, but the sequence given suggests a stepwise approach. Assuming the oxidation of the methyl group to an aldehyde is the intended reaction is the most chemically sound pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde reacts with acetone in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation known as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which occurs between a ketone and an aldehyde that has no α-hydrogens. The hydroxide ion removes a proton from acetone to form an enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting intermediate typically dehydrates under the reaction conditions to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product, **Product 3**, is (*E*)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nThe structure of the final product, (*E*)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is:\n\nO₂N—(C₆H₄)—CH=CH—C(=O)—CH₃\n\nTo determine its molecular symmetry group, we analyze its symmetry elements:\n*   **Planarity**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, a C=C double bond, and a C=O double bond, all conjugated. This extensive conjugation favors a planar arrangement of the main atomic backbone to maximize orbital overlap.\n*   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ)**: There is no axis of rotation (other than C₁) that would leave the molecule unchanged. The nitrophenyl group on one end and the acetyl group on the other make it asymmetric along its length.\n*   **Mirror Plane (σ)**: Assuming the favored planar conformation, the plane containing the heavy atoms of the backbone (aromatic ring, enone system) is a plane of symmetry. The hydrogens of the methyl group can be arranged so that one lies in this plane and the other two are positioned symmetrically above and below it. Therefore, the molecule possesses a single mirror plane.\n*   **Inversion Center (i)**: The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that only possesses the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
