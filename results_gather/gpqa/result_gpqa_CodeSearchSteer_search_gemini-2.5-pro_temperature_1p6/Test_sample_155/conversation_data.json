    "### Analysis of Chromatographic Separation\n\nThe problem asks for the number of peaks observed when a mixture of reaction products is analyzed by standard (achiral) and chiral High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). To determine this, we must first identify the stereochemical outcome of each reaction.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Product 1**\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with m-CPBA. This is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, which results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, this step produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The epoxide ring is opened by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product has two chiral centers but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 yields a single, achiral meso-diol.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Product 2**\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) undergoes a *syn*-addition with m-CPBA to form a *cis*-epoxide. This cis-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The subsequent *anti*-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide leads to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, this reaction produces a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\n**HPLC Analysis**\n\nThe chemist runs this three-component mixture on two types of HPLC columns:\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus co-elute, appearing as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks: one for the meso-diol and a second, larger peak for the unresolved racemic mixture.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. Consequently, a chiral HPLC can resolve all three stereoisomers in the mixture. It will separate the meso compound from the enantiomers (as they are diastereomers) and will also separate the two enantiomers from each other. This results in three distinct peaks in the chromatogram: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
