    "To determine the correct option, we need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) and assess the renormalizability of the theory based on that.\n\n### 1. Determining Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nIn natural units (where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\)), the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}\\) is dimensionless. Since the differential \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of \\([M]^{-4}\\), the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\([M]^4\\).\n\nLet's find the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\):\n\n*   **Fermion Field \\(\\psi\\):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is \\(\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing \\([\\partial_\\mu] = [M]^1\\), the dimension of \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\) must be \\([M]^3\\). This implies that the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) (and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\)) has a mass dimension of \\([M]^{3/2}\\).\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the dimension of \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) must be \\([M]^2\\).\n*   **Sigma Tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\):** The term \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]\\) is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless constants. Therefore, \\([\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^0\\).\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mass Dimension of \\(\\kappa\\)\n\nThe interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) must have the same mass dimension as the rest of the Lagrangian, which is \\([M]^4\\).\n\nWe can set up the equation for the dimensions of the interaction term:\n\\[[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^4\\]\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n\\[[\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] + 5 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] = -1\\]\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n### 3. Determining Renormalizability\n\nIn quantum field theory, renormalizability can be assessed by power counting. A key criterion is the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the Lagrangian.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a non-negative mass dimension (\\([\\text{g}] \\ge 0\\)), the theory is generally renormalizable.\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension (\\([\\text{g}] < 0\\)), the theory is considered non-renormalizable by power counting. Interactions with negative mass dimension coupling constants become problematic at high energies and lead to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.\n\nSince we found that \\([\\kappa] = -1\\), which is negative, the theory described by this interaction Lagrangian is not renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
