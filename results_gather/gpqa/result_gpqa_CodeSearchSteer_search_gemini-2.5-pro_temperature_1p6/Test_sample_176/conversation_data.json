    "The reasoning is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (total power radiated) of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature. This confirms that luminosity is proportional to R²T⁴.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The wavelength of peak emission (λ_max) for a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (λ_max = b/T). This means if λ_max is known, temperature can be determined.\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light**: The observed wavelength of light is shifted depending on the relative velocity between the source and observer. For a source moving away, the wavelength increases (redshift). The problem specifies the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same, which means the temperatures must be adjusted for the Doppler shift of Star 2. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c). A positive velocity indicates a redshift (moving away).\n*   **Mass-Luminosity Relation**: There is a relationship between a main sequence star's mass and its luminosity (L ∝ M^3.5), but this is an empirical relation. The problem gives enough specific information (radius, peak wavelength, velocity) to use the more fundamental black body laws, making the mass information likely a distractor.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation derived in the thought process is sound and based on the correct physical principles confirmed by the search.\n\n**Calculation Recap:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula:**\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:**\n    Given R1 = 1.5 * R2, so (R1/R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   It is given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    *   Wien's Law gives the rest-frame peak wavelength: λ_rest = b/T.\n    *   For Star 1 (v1 = 0), λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 = b/T1.\n    *   For Star 2 (v2 = 700 km/s), the observed wavelength is Doppler shifted: λ_obs,2 ≈ λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c).\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c).\n    *   This gives the temperature ratio: T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   L1 / L2 = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v2/c)]⁴\n    *   v2 = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s\n    *   c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v2/c ≈ 0.002333\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937\n    *   L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
