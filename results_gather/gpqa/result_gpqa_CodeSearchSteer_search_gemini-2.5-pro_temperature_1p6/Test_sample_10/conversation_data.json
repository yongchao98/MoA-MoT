    "### Statement A Evaluation\n\nProgrammed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2 is a -1 frameshift event, meaning the ribosome shifts backward by one nucleotide. This process is facilitated by a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. The pseudoknot structure creates tension that causes the ribosome to pause and slip at the slippery site. The frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar in sequence and structure to that of SARS-CoV. Functional studies show that both viruses have nearly identical levels of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF), and their pseudoknots have virtually identical global structures. Therefore, statement A is correct.\n\n### Statement B Evaluation\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF3a has been shown to induce apoptosis. Studies have observed that ORF3a expression leads to the activation and cleavage of caspase-8. Caspase-8 is a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is typically triggered by death receptors. The same studies found that ORF3a did not alter the expression levels of Bcl-2, an important regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway. However, other research indicates that the activation of caspase-8 by ORF3a can lead to the cleavage of Bid into tBid, which in turn triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and the subsequent activation of caspase-9, a key component of the intrinsic pathway. Thus, ORF3a appears to initiate apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway (caspase-8 activation), which then cross-talks with and activates the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, the statement that apoptosis is induced *via* the extrinsic pathway is a correct interpretation of the initial events.\n\n### Statement C Evaluation\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins nsp14 and nsp10 form a heterodimer complex. The nsp14 protein has an N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain that possesses a proofreading function, excising mismatched nucleotides during RNA replication. The activity of the nsp14-ExoN is significantly stimulated (over 35-fold) when it binds to its cofactor, nsp10. This complex is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of the large RNA genome by performing mismatch repair. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex acts on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), degrading it from the 3' to 5' direction and removing mismatched nucleotides at the 3' end. However, a study showed that a mutation in the nsp14-ExoN domain led to a *decrease* in dsRNA intermediate aggregation, not prevention of its breakdown. In fact, the complex's primary function is to degrade RNA, specifically to remove incorrectly incorporated nucleotides from dsRNA, thereby preventing errors, not preventing the breakdown of dsRNA itself. Therefore, the last part of the statement, \"prevents the breakdown of dsRNA,\" is incorrect as the complex actively degrades dsRNA to perform its proofreading function.\n\n### Statement D Evaluation\n\nResearch on ribosomal frameshifting has explored the relationship between the structure of the RNA pseudoknot and the efficiency of frameshifting. Studies using optical traps have shown that for some viral pseudoknots, the rate of frameshifting is correlated with their conformational plasticity—their ability to adopt multiple non-native structures under tension. Specifically, a linear correlation has been described between the in vitro frameshifting rate and the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. Both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting signals have been observed to adopt two main conformations when placed under tension, which is consistent with their comparable frameshifting rates. Thus, statement D is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, statement C contains an inaccuracy. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex's role is to perform mismatch repair by *degrading* dsRNA to remove errors, not to prevent its breakdown.\n\n<<<C>>>"
