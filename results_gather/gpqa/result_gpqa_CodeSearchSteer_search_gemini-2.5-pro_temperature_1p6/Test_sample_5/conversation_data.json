    "The provided potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). To solve for the energy spectrum, it is convenient to convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\nThe relationships between Cartesian and polar coordinates are:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these, we can express the terms in the potential as:\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n*   r^2 cos^2(θ) = (r cos(θ))^2 = x^2\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The total potential is V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by the formula E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where ω = sqrt(K/m) and K is the effective spring constant.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy for the x-component is:\nE_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the effective spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy for the y-component is:\nE_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nSince the motions are independent, the total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies for the x and y directions.\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (2n_x + 1)ℏ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
