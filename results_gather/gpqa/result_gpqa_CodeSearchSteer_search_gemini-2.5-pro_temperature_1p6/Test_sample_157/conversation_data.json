    "A dominant-negative mutation is one where the altered gene product not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein present in the same cell. This phenomenon is common in proteins that need to form dimers or larger complexes to be active.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scenario and the options:\n\n*   **Normal Function:** The transcription factor subunit must dimerize (pair up) to enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription.\n*   **Mutation Y:** This mutation is in the dimerization domain. Because it is dominant-negative, the mutant protein (Y) must be stable enough to interact with the wild-type protein (WT). When a mutant Y protein dimerizes with a wild-type WT protein, it forms a non-functional WT-Y heterodimer. This \"poisons\" the complex, preventing the wild-type protein from performing its job.\n*   **Consequence:** This interference actively causes a loss of function of the protein produced from the wild-type allele, which is the hallmark of a dominant-negative effect.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function phenotype, not a gain-of-function.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can occur with some mutations and lead to a loss of function, it isn't the most specific mechanism for a dominant-negative effect involving a dimerization domain. The key is the interference with the wild-type partner, not just clumping of the mutant protein.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely phenotype. The phrase \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" perfectly describes the outcome of a dominant-negative mutation where the mutant protein antagonizes the wild-type one. A plausible molecular mechanism for this is that the non-functional heterodimer formed between the mutant and wild-type subunits is recognized as faulty by the cell and targeted for degradation. This would lead to the degradation of both the mutant and the wild-type proteins that are trapped in the complex.\n*   **D) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A complete loss of the ability to dimerize would likely result in a recessive mutation, as the mutant protein would not be able to interfere with the wild-type proteins, which could still form functional WT-WT dimers. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutation, by definition, produces a mutant, not a wild-type, phenotype.\n\n<<<C>>>"
