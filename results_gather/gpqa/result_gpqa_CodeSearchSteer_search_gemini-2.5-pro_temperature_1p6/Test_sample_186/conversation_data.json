    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, several factors need to be considered: the star's brightness, its location in the sky, and the spectrograph's capabilities. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a one-hour exposure with one of the 8-meter VLT telescopes.\n\n### ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude\n\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO) states that ESPRESSO, when coupled with a single 8-meter Unit Telescope (1-UT mode), can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10 for a star with a V-band magnitude of 20 in a one-hour exposure. Therefore, stars with an apparent visual magnitude brighter than or equal to 20 should be detectable under the specified conditions, provided they are observable from the Paranal Observatory.\n\n### Star Analysis\n\nFirst, the location of the Paranal Observatory must be considered. Located at a latitude of about 24 degrees south, it cannot observe stars that are very far in the northern celestial hemisphere.\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Observability:** It has a declination of about -52 degrees, making it easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Since its magnitude of -0.74 is much brighter than the limiting magnitude of 20, Canopus is detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Polaris has an apparent visual magnitude that fluctuates around 2.0.\n*   **Observability:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of about +89 degrees. Due to its extreme northern declination, it is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Detectability:** Polaris is not detectable from Paranal, regardless of its brightness.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** Using the distance modulus formula, m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10), where M_V is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0\n*   **Observability:** Located at a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With a magnitude of 15.0, it is brighter than the limiting magnitude of 20, making it detectable.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at 200 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5\n*   **Observability:** Located at a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** Its magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of 20, so it is not detectable.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5\n*   **Observability:** Located at a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** With a magnitude of 13.5, it is brighter than the limiting magnitude of 20 and therefore detectable.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at 50 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5\n*   **Observability:** Located at a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** Its magnitude of 18.5 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of 20, making it detectable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTallying the detectable stars:\n*   **Canopus:** Yes\n*   **Polaris:** No (not observable)\n*   **Star c (V=15.0):** Yes\n*   **Star d (V=21.5):** No (too faint)\n*   **Star e (V=13.5):** Yes\n*   **Star f (V=18.5):** Yes\n\nA total of four stars from the list are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the given conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
