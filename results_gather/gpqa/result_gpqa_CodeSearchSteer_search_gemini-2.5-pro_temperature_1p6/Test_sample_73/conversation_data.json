    "This is a classic problem involving the principles of radioactive decay, which is governed by an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ) from the initial information provided. The probability of decay, P(decay), within a certain time *t* is given by the formula:\n\nP(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nBy rearranging the equation, we can solve for the term containing λ:\n\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. We want to calculate P(decay) for t = 150 minutes.\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite the exponent:\n\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nSince we already calculated that e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68, we can substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating the value:\n\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, calculating the probability of decay:\n\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nWhen converted to a percentage, the probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
