    "Here's a breakdown of the reactions and the resulting analysis:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n**(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.**\n\n*   The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, has a single chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from either face, leading to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n**Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.**\n\n*   The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is an achiral molecule.\n*   Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   The reduction can result in three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. It is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Products and HPLC Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate diastereomers, but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a single peak. This gives another **two peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be **4**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\n*   Since the final mixture contains five chemically distinct stereoisomers, the chiral HPLC will resolve each of them.\n    1.  Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be **5**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
