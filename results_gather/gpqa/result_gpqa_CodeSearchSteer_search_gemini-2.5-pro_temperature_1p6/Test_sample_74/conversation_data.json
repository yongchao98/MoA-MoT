  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To understand why the protein is not being expressed, we must analyze the provided DNA sequence by translating it into an amino acid sequence.\n\nThe sequence begins with 5'-ATG..., which is the correct start codon for translation. The plan is to have an N-terminal HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.\n\nThe standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence for this tag is typically 5'-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3'.\n\nLet's translate the beginning of the provided construct sequence codon by codon:\n*   **1. ATG:** Methionine (Start codon)\n*   **2. TAC:** Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **3. CCA:** Proline (P)\n*   **4. TAC:** Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **5. GAT:** Aspartic Acid (D)\n*   **6. GTT:** Valine (V)\n*   **7. CCA:** Proline (P)\n*   **8. GAT:** Aspartic Acid (D)\n*   **9. TAC:** Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **10. GCC:** Alanine (A)\n*   **11. AAA:** Lysine (K)\n*   **12. TGA:** **Stop codon**\n\nThe translation shows two issues. First, there is a missense mutation in the HA tag sequence; codon 6 is GTT (Valine) instead of the canonical CCA/CCT/CCG (Proline). This would result in an MYPYD**V**PDYA tag sequence.\n\nHowever, the most critical error comes immediately after. The 12th codon in the sequence is TGA. TGA is one of the three standard stop codons (along with TAA and TAG) that signal the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis. The presence of this premature stop codon means that the ribosome will stop translation after adding the 11th amino acid (Lysine). The full-length GADD45G protein will not be produced at all. Only a very short, non-functional 11-amino acid peptide will be created, which would explain the complete inability to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome terminated the translation early due to an unintended stop codon in the engineered sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
