    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the state |alpha>\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet's write it as `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`, where C is the normalization constant.\n\nIn matrix notation, where `|up>` is `[1, 0]^T` and `|down>` is `[0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = C * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\nFor the state to be normalized, the inner product `<alpha|alpha>` must be equal to 1. The corresponding bra vector `<alpha|` is `C* * [1-i, 2+i]`.\n\n`<alpha|alpha> = C*C * [1-i, 2+i] * [1+i, 2-i]^T = 1`\n`|C|^2 * ((1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)) = 1`\n`|C|^2 * ((1 - i^2) + (4 - i^2)) = 1`\n`|C|^2 * ((1 + 1) + (4 + 1)) = 1`\n`|C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 1`\n`7 * |C|^2 = 1 => |C|^2 = 1/7`\n\nChoosing the real, positive root for C, we get `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\n### 2. The Operator A and its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aii = 0`. This gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli matrix `sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = hbar^2 / 4`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [x, y]^T = 0`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it gives the first eigenstate `|a₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [x, y]^T = 0`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`.\n    Normalizing it gives the second eigenstate `|a₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_k` is given by `P(λ_k) = |<a_k|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₁) = |<a₁|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<down|down> ]`\n    `<a₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₂) = |<a₂|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i)<up|up> - (2-i)<down|down> ]`\n    `<a₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - (2 - i)) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n1.  Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:\n    `<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n    `<A> = hbar/7`\n\n2.  Using the matrix representation `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`:\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * ( (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] ) * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i + i²) + (2 + 3i + i²) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
