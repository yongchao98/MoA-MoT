    "An electron in a hydrogen atom undergoes a transition from an initial state \\(|n,l,m\\rangle\\) to a final state by emitting a photon. The rules that govern these electric dipole transitions, known as selection rules, dictate the change in the quantum numbers. Specifically, the orbital angular momentum quantum number, \\(l\\), must change by \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\), and the magnetic quantum number, \\(m\\), must change by \\(\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1\\). The principal quantum number, \\(n\\), is not subject to a specific selection rule but must decrease for emission.\n\nThe decay from the \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) state to the \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\) state cannot occur directly because it would require \\(\\Delta l = 0\\), which violates the selection rules. Therefore, the transition must proceed through an intermediate state via two successive dipole transitions.\n\n**First Transition: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle\\)**\n\n*   **Initial State:** \\(n=3, l=0, m=0\\)\n*   Applying the selection rule \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\), the intermediate state must have \\(l'=1\\).\n*   Applying the selection rule \\(\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1\\), the intermediate state can have \\(m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1\\).\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, so \\(n' < 3\\). The most probable decay cascade occurs to the next lowest energy level, which is \\(n'=2\\).\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\), \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\).\n\n**Second Transition: \\(|2,l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)**\n\n*   **Final State:** \\(n=1, l=0, m=0\\)\n*   For each of the possible intermediate states, we must check if the transition to the ground state is allowed:\n    *   From \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\): \\(\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1\\) and \\(\\Delta m = 0-0 = 0\\). This is an allowed transition.\n    *   From \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\): \\(\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1\\) and \\(\\Delta m = 0-1 = -1\\). This is an allowed transition.\n    *   From \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\): \\(\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1\\) and \\(\\Delta m = 0-(-1) = +1\\). This is an allowed transition.\n\nAll three pathways are permitted by the selection rules. The question now is about the probability of each route.\n\nThe initial state, \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\), is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, the atom has no preferred direction of emission. Consequently, the transitions to the three intermediate states \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\), \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\) are equally probable. Since there are three possible and equally likely decay routes, the probability of the atom decaying through any single specific route is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\): The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\): The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\): The transition route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   D) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\): The transition route is valid, and the corresponding probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
