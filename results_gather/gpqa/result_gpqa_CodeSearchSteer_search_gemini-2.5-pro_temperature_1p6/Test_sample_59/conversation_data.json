    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take for the 22-year-old astronaut, we need to follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).**\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. This means light takes 163,000 years to travel from the LMC to us.\n\n**2. Calculate the travel time from an Earth-based observer's perspective (Δt').**\nThe spacecraft travels at a speed (v) of 0.99999987*c*. The time it would take as measured from Earth is the distance divided by the speed.\n\n*   **Distance (D):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n\nΔt' = D / v = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c ≈ 163,000.0212 years\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on Earth, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n**3. Calculate the time elapsed for the astronaut using the principles of time dilation.**\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time for the moving astronaut will pass much slower than for a stationary observer. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = γ * Δt\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δt'** is the time for the stationary observer (on Earth).\n*   **Δt** is the time for the moving observer (the astronaut), which is what we need to find.\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:  γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given speed:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow, we can find the time elapsed for the astronaut (Δt) by rearranging the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = Δt' / γ\nΔt = 163,000.0212 years / 1961.16\n**Δt ≈ 83.1 years**\n\n**4. Determine the astronaut's age upon arrival.**\nThe journey will take approximately 83.1 years from the astronaut's point of view. Since the astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the mission, their age upon arrival at Earth would be:\n\n22 years + 83.1 years = 105.1 years\n\nThis is well within the average lifetime of 150 solar years for this alien species, so the astronaut would survive the journey.\n\nComparing our calculated travel time of roughly 83 years with the given options, the closest answer is 81 years. The slight discrepancy can arise from using a slightly different distance to the LMC (some estimates are closer to 160,000 light-years) or rounding during calculations. Let's re-calculate with a distance of 160,000 light-years:\n\nΔt' = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c ≈ 160,000.0208 years\nΔt = 160,000.0208 years / 1961.16 ≈ **81.58 years**\n\nThis result is very close to 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
