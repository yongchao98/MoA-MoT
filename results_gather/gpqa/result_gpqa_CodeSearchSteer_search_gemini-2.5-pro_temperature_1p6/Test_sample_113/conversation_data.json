    "Based on the principles of organic chemistry and the provided search results, we can determine the appropriate reagents for each reaction.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. A ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with cyanide to form a cyanohydrin.\n\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** The reaction requires a source of protons to generate hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) and to protonate the alkoxide intermediate that forms after the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon. Often, this reaction is carried out by adding a strong acid to a mixture of the carbonyl compound and sodium cyanide. The notation H3O+ represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution, which serves as the necessary proton source. Therefore, A = H3O+.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a process known as hydrolysis.\n\n*   **Role of Reagent B:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either an acid or a base in the presence of water. Strong mineral acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) are commonly used for this purpose. The nitrile is typically heated with the dilute acid to drive the reaction. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\nCombining these findings, reagent A is H3O+ and reagent B is HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
