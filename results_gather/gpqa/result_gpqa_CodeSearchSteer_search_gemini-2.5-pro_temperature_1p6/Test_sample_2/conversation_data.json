    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in matrix form.\n\nThe spin-up and spin-down states are represented by the vectors:\n*   |↑⟩ =\n*   |↓⟩ =\n\nThe given state of the spin-half particle is a linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\nIn vector notation, this is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2]\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are defined as:\n*   σz = [, [0, -1]]\n*   σx = [,]\n\nThe operator for which we want to find the expectation value is:\nÔ = 10σz + 5σx\nSubstituting the matrices:\nÔ = 10 * [, [0, -1]] + 5 * [,]\nÔ = [, [0, -10]] + [,]\nÔ = [, [5, -10]]\n\nThe expectation value ⟨Ô⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. First, we find the bra vector ⟨ψ|, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector |ψ⟩. Since the components are real, it's just the transpose:\n⟨ψ| = [0.5, (√3)/2]\n\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩:\n⟨Ô⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [, [5, -10]] * [[0.5], [(√3)/2]]\n\nLet's first multiply the operator matrix Ô by the ket vector |ψ⟩:\n[, [5, -10]] * [[0.5], [(√3)/2]] = [[(10 * 0.5) + (5 * √3/2)], [(5 * 0.5) - (10 * √3/2)]] = [[5 + 2.5√3], [2.5 - 5√3]]\n\nNow, multiply the resulting vector by the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n⟨Ô⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[5 + 2.5√3], [2.5 - 5√3]]\n⟨Ô⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 2.5√3) + (√3)/2 * (2.5 - 5√3)\n⟨Ô⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5*3)/2\n⟨Ô⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5\n⟨Ô⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨Ô⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨Ô⟩ = -5 + 4.33\n⟨Ô⟩ = -0.67\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately. The expectation value of the sum of operators is the sum of their individual expectation values:\n⟨Ô⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\nThe expectation value of σz is:\n⟨σz⟩ = |c↑|² - |c↓|² = (0.5)² - ((√3)/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nThe expectation value of σx is:\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [,] * [[0.5], [(√3)/2]]\n⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[(√3)/2], [0.5]]\n⟨σx⟩ = 0.5 * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * 0.5 = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, combine these to find the total expectation value:\n⟨Ô⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨Ô⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n⟨Ô⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67\n\nThe calculated expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\n<<<B>>>"
