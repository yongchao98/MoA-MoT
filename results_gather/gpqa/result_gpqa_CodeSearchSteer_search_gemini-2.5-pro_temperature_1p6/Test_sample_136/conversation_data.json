    "The confirmatory search of existing literature and example problems confirms the methodology used in the initial thinking process.\n\n*   The energy gain in a cyclotron-type accelerator is achieved by passing particles through an accelerating gap multiple times.\n*   The total number of revolutions can be calculated by dividing the total kinetic energy to be gained by the energy gain per revolution.\n*   A synchrocyclotron varies the RF frequency to account for relativistic effects, but the principle of energy gain per turn remains the same. It involves a synchronous phase (Φs) at which the particle crosses the accelerating gap.\n*   The energy gain per pass is given by ΔT = q * V, where V is the instantaneous voltage. In this case, V = U₀ * cos(Φs).\n*   Typically, cyclotrons have two D-shaped electrodes (dees), and particles are accelerated twice per revolution, once on entering a dee and once on leaving. The problem statement explicitly says there are two accelerations per revolution.\n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the total energy gain required:**\n    The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (T_initial ≈ 0) and needs to reach a final kinetic energy of T_final = 950 MeV.\n    Total energy gain (ΔT_total) = T_final - T_initial = 950 MeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy gain per revolution:**\n    The peak accelerating voltage is U₀ = 190 kV = 0.190 MV.\n    The proton crosses the gap at a synchronous phase of Φs = π/4.\n    The energy gained in a single pass across the gap is:\n    ΔT_pass = e * U₀ * cos(Φs)\n    Substituting the values (and using units of MeV for energy and MV for potential, so 'e' cancels):\n    ΔT_pass = 0.190 * cos(π/4) MeV\n    ΔT_pass = 0.190 * (√2 / 2) MeV ≈ 0.13435 MeV.\n    Since there are two accelerations per revolution, the energy gain per revolution is:\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔT_pass = 2 * 0.190 * (√2 / 2) MeV = 0.190 * √2 MeV.\n    ΔT_rev ≈ 0.2687 MeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of revolutions:**\n    The total number of revolutions (N) is the total energy gain divided by the energy gain per revolution.\n    N = ΔT_total / ΔT_rev\n    N = 950 MeV / (0.190 * √2 MeV)\n    N ≈ 950 / 0.2687\n    N ≈ 3535.53\n\n4.  **Interpret the result:**\n    The number of revolutions must be an integer. After 3535 revolutions, the proton's energy would be 3535 * (0.190 * √2) ≈ 949.8 MeV, which is less than the required 950 MeV. Therefore, the proton must undergo acceleration in the 3536th revolution to reach or exceed the target energy. Thus, the total number of revolutions is 3536.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
