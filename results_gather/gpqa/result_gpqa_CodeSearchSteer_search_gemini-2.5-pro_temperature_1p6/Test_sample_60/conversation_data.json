    "Here is the step-by-step synthesis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO₃ and H₂SO₄**\nThis is the nitration of benzene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. Benzene reacts with the nitronium ion to form nitrobenzene.\n\n*   **Product 1 is Nitrobenzene.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with Br₂ and iron powder**\nThis reaction is the bromination of nitrobenzene. The nitro group (–NO₂) is a deactivating and *meta*-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. The iron powder acts as a catalyst with bromine to form the electrophile. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the position *meta* to the nitro group.\n\n*   **Product 2 is 3-bromonitrobenzene.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (3-bromonitrobenzene) is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\nThis is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This process is a standard method for reducing a nitro group (–NO₂) to a primary amino group (–NH₂).\n\n*   **Product 3 is 3-bromoaniline.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO₂ and HBF₄**\nThis is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (3-bromoaniline) reacts with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and a strong acid (in this case, hydrofluoroboric acid, HBF₄) to form a diazonium salt.\n\n*   **Product 4 is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.**\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole**\nThis is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which involves the coupling of a diazonium salt with another aromatic compound to form a biaryl system. The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt, upon heating, forms a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the anisole (methoxybenzene) molecule. The methoxy group (–OCH₃) on anisole is an ortho-, para-director. Due to less steric hindrance, the coupling preferentially occurs at the *para* position. This results in the formation of a biphenyl molecule with a bromine at the 3-position of the first ring and a methoxy group at the 4'-position of the second ring.\n\n*   **Final Product 5 is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n*   B) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n*   C) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl\n*   D) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n\nThe correct structure matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
