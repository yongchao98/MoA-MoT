    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electrostatic potential energy from all pairs of charges. The system consists of a central charge and 12 charges on the surface of a sphere. The total energy is the sum of two components: the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 surface charges, and the interaction energy among the 12 surface charges themselves.\n\n### 1. Interaction Energy: Central Charge and Surface Charges\n\nThe potential energy `U` between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `r` is given by `U = k * q1 * q2 / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`≈ 8.988 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`).\n\nIn this system:\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n*   Elementary charge, `e = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   So, `q = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   The distance from the central charge to each of the 12 charges is `R = 2 m`.\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge and one surface charge is `U_pair = k * q^2 / R`. Since there are 12 such charges, the total energy for this component is:\n`U_cs = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n### 2. Interaction Energy: Among the 12 Surface Charges\n\nTo find the minimum energy for the 12 identical charges on the surface of a sphere, they must arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is a well-known problem called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is given by `U_ss = C_12 * (k * q^2 / R)`, where `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of scaled inverse distances between all pairs of vertices of the icosahedron. This constant has a known value of approximately `49.16548`.\n\n### 3. Total Minimum Energy\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two energy components. The presence of the central charge exerts an equal radial force on all surface charges and does not change their optimal icosahedral arrangement.\n\n`E_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n`E_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (49.16548 * k * q^2 / R)`\n`E_total = (12 + 49.16548) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`E_total = 61.16548 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values:\n*   `k ≈ 8.988 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `q^2 = (3.204353268 × 10^-19 C)^2 ≈ 1.0267877 × 10^-37 C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\n`E_total = 61.16548 * ( (8.988 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²) * (1.0267877 × 10^-37 C²) / 2 m )`\n`E_total = 61.16548 * ( (9.2286 × 10^-28 J⋅m) / 2 m )`\n`E_total = 61.16548 * ( 4.6143 × 10^-28 J )`\n`E_total ≈ 2.82208 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.822 × 10^-26 J`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
