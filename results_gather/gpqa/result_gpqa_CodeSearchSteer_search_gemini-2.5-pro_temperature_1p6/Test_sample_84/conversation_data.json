    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe can write the ratio for the two planets as:\n`(T_eq1) / (T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`), most terms cancel out:\n`(T_eq1) / (T_eq2) = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a_1)) / (R_star / (2 * a_2)))`\n`(T_eq1) / (T_eq2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the star's velocity wobble (semi-amplitude `K`) caused by the orbiting planet. For a circular orbit, this is given by:\n`K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `a` is the semi-major axis, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n`K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**5. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):**\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁):**\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**7. Determine the Ratios of Masses and RV Semi-Amplitudes:**\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   `M_p1 = 7 M_earth` and `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   The Doppler shift `Δλ` is proportional to the radial velocity `K` (`K = c * Δλ/λ`). Therefore, the ratio `K_1 / K_2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å` and `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n    `K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n**8. Substitute the Ratios to find a₂/a₁:**\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the value of `a_2 / a_1` back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n`(T_eq1) / (T_eq2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`(T_eq1) / (T_eq2) = 15 / 28`\n`(T_eq1) / (T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
