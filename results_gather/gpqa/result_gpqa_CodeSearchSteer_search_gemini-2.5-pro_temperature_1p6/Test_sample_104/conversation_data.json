    "The initial analysis and calculation seem robust and are based on fundamental principles of astrophysics. The search results confirm the standard formulas used.\n\n*   **Exoplanet Transit Depth:** Multiple sources confirm that the transit depth (the dip in brightness) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which simplifies to (R_pl / R_star)². This matches the formula used in the derivation.\n\n*   **Starspot Photometric Variation:** The brightness variation of a spotted star is due to the contrast in flux (and therefore temperature) between the normal photosphere and the cooler spots. As the star rotates, the total observed flux changes depending on the visibility of the spotted regions. The Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴) is the correct physical principle to calculate the flux contrast. My derivation for the amplitude of the signal, `A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`, correctly models this by considering the fractional area covered by spots (`f`) and the relative flux difference between the spots and the photosphere.\n\nThe problem requires equating these two effects: the amplitude of the rotational modulation due to spots and the amplitude of a hypothetical transit.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Variation from the Spotted Star:**\n    *   The star's unspotted flux (when the clean hemisphere faces the observer) is proportional to `F_phot = σ * T_eff⁴`.\n    *   The flux from the spotted hemisphere is a combination of the unspotted portion and the spotted portion. The spots cover a fraction `f = 0.2` of this hemisphere. The flux from this side is proportional to `(1-f) * F_phot + f * F_spot`.\n    *   The flux from the spots is `F_spot = σ * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The relative amplitude of the brightness variation is `A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   This simplifies to `A = f * [1 - (F_spot / F_phot)] = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`.\n\n    *Plugging in the numbers:*\n    *   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    *   `f = 0.20`\n    *   `A = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n    *   `A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n    *   `A = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n    *   `A = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n    *   `A = 0.10355`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size:**\n    *   The transit depth for an exoplanet is given by `TD = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n    *   We set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the starspot variation: `TD = A`.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\n3.  **Solve for the Radius Ratio:**\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis result is approximately 0.32, which corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic.\n- The model assumes the observer sees the full hemisphere face-on, which is a simplification for calculating the maximum variation amplitude.\n- The equation for transit depth is standard.\n- The equation for the spotted star variation is derived directly from the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the definition of flux variation.\nThe calculation is straightforward and leads directly to one of the provided answers. No more information is needed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
