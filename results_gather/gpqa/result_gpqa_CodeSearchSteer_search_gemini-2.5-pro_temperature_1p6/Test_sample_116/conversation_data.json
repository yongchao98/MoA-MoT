    "To determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule's structure must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a molecule contains a chiral center or exhibits axial chirality.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound belongs to a class of molecules called biphenyls. Certain substituted biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality known as atropisomerism. This occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered by large substituent groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are occupied by bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. This significant steric hindrance prevents free rotation, leading to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound is optically active. The discovery of optical activity in the related compound, 6,6'-dinitrodiphenic acid, was a landmark in understanding this type of isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. To check for optical isomerism, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (D and L isomers) and is optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone, (C₆H₅)₂C=O, features a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This central carbon is sp²-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups, not four. Furthermore, the two phenyl groups attached to it are identical. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is the *trans*-isomer, meaning the methoxycarbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to the presence of the double bond, the molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
