    "### Analyzing the Mean Free Paths\n\nThis problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths within the same volume of gas:\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. It is governed by the principles of the kinetic theory of gases. The formula for this mean free path includes the number density of the gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section of the molecules (σ_gas). Specifically, λ1 is described by the formula:  \n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)\n    The term σ_gas is related to the physical diameter of the gas molecules, and the √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules.\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This is the average distance a high-energy electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a residual gas molecule. Its formula depends on the same number density (n) of gas molecules but involves a different effective cross-section, that of electron scattering (σ_electron):  \n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_electron)\n    In this case, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets because the 1000 kV electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, making the thermal motion of the gas molecules negligible in comparison.\n\n### Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in understanding the difference between the collision cross-sections, σ_gas and σ_electron.\n\n1.  **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gas):** This represents the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. It's determined by their physical size (kinetic diameter). For a typical molecule like N₂, this diameter is a few angstroms.\n\n2.  **Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section (σ_electron):** This is the effective area a gas molecule presents for a scattering event with a high-energy electron. A 1000 kV electron is a highly energetic, relativistic particle. Its interaction with a gas molecule is not like a collision between two billiard balls. Instead, it scatters off the electric fields of the atom's nucleus and its electrons. For such high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section is significantly *smaller* than the physical cross-section of the gas molecule. The electron is a tiny particle moving very fast, making it much less likely to interact with the gas molecule compared to another gas molecule of comparable size.\n\n### Conclusion on λ1 and λ2\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), the relationship between them is as follows:\n\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ_gas.\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ_electron.\n\nGiven that the electron scattering cross-section (σ_electron) is much smaller than the gas-gas collision cross-section (σ_gas), the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nTherefore, **λ2 > λ1**.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect. The interaction physics are different.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This would imply electrons are more likely to scatter, which is false for high-energy electrons.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22\\*λ1: This correctly identifies λ2 as larger than λ1 but imposes a very small upper limit that is physically unwarranted. The difference is expected to be much larger.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22\\*λ1: This is the only option that correctly establishes that λ2 is larger than λ1 and allows for the significant difference expected from the physics of the interactions. The factor 1.22 simply serves to create a definitive inequality that is consistent with the physical reasoning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
