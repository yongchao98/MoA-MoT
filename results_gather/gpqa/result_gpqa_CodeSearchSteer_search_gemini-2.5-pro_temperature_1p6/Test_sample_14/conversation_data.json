    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we can analyze the geometric transit probability.\n\n### Principles\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is the ratio of the star's radius (R★) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n    *   `Probability (p) ∝ R★ / a`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The semi-major axis (`a`) of an orbit is related to the orbital period (P) and the mass of the host star (M★). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M★`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n        `a³ ∝ M★ * P²`\n        `a ∝ (M★ * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can find the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 (`p₁`) and Planet_2 (`p₂`).\n\nFirst, let's express the probability `p` in terms of the given parameters (R★, M★, P):\n*   `p ∝ R★ / (M★ * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, let's set up the ratio `p₁ / p₂`:\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = [R★₁ / (M★₁ * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [R★₂ / (M★₂ * P₂²)^(1/3)]`\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = (R★₁ / R★₂) * (M★₁ / M★₂)^(-1/3) * (P₁ / P₂)^(-2/3)`\n\nNext, we plug in the relationships provided in the problem:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R★₁ = R★₂`, so `R★₁ / R★₂ = 1`.\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: `M★₁ = 2 * M★₂`, so `M★₁ / M★₂ = 2`.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`, so `P₁ / P₂ = 1/3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = (3²)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n*   `p₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n*   `p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65096`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
