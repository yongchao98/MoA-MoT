    "To definitively identify the unknown organic compound, the provided ¹H NMR data will be analyzed step-by-step and compared with the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet peak with an integration of 3H around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). It's a doublet, meaning it is coupled to (split by) one adjacent proton. The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, *J*, of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemistry-dependent. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration across the double bond. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller coupling constant (usually 6-15 Hz). This strongly suggests the unknown is a *trans* isomer, allowing us to rule out Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is also a vinylic proton. The multiplicity \"dq\" means it is a doublet of quartets. This indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (a methyl group, giving the quartet).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to three protons, indicating a methyl group. It is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n\n### Evaluating the Remaining Options:\n\nBased on the large coupling constant, we are left with two possibilities: Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n1.  **Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃):**\n    *   **Acetate methyl ( -C(=O)CH₃):** This matches the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   **Vinylic protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two. The proton attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen (H-C-O) is coupled to the other vinylic proton, which would appear as a doublet. This corresponds to the signal at 7.0 ppm. The other vinylic proton is coupled to both the first vinylic proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet). This \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) perfectly matches the signal at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Other methyl (CH₃-C=):** The protons of this methyl group are coupled to the adjacent vinylic proton, which would split their signal into a doublet. This matches the signal at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data.\n\n2.  **Trans-butenyl acetate (e.g., Trans-crotyl acetate or (E)-but-2-en-1-yl acetate, CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃):**\n    *   This structure would have an acetate singlet (CH₃CO-).\n    *   It has vinylic protons (-CH=CH-), which would show trans-coupling.\n    *   It has a methyl group on the double bond (CH₃-CH=), which would appear as a doublet.\n    *   However, it also has a methylene group (-CH₂-O-) not adjacent to a chiral center, whose protons would be coupled to the neighboring vinylic proton, resulting in a doublet around 4.0-4.5 ppm. This signal is absent from the provided data. Instead of the complex signal at 5.5 ppm (dq), we would expect two vinylic protons in a more complex multiplet pattern and the separate methylene doublet. Thus, Trans-butenyl acetate is not a match.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe provided ¹H NMR data, particularly the chemical shifts, multiplicities, and the large *trans* coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, unequivocally matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
