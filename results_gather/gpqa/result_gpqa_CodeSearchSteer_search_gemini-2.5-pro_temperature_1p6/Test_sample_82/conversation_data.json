    "Here is a step-by-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points of the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of CH₃COOH:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = 0.020 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **New concentration after dilution:**\n    New volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n    New Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = **0.025 M CH₃COOH**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nThis point is before the equivalence point, where some of the acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Determine the volume at the equivalence point:**\n    The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n    Moles of acid (0.001 mol) must equal moles of base.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH added at 25% titration:**\n    Volume of NaOH added = 25% of 10.00 cm³ = 2.5 cm³ = 0.0025 L\n    Moles of NaOH added = 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol\n\n*   **Calculate moles of acid and conjugate base:**\n    *   The 0.00025 mol of NaOH will react with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (conjugate base) formed = 0.00025 mol\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH (acid) remaining = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\n*   **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    The pKa of acetic acid is calculated from the given Ka value (1.85 x 10⁻⁵). Note that the literature value can vary slightly, but we will use the one provided.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 mol / 0.00075 mol)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH = 4.253** ≈ **4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.001 mol\n    *   Total volume = Initial volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for the conjugate base:**\n    *   The reaction with water is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   **Kb = 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰**\n\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    *   We can set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is very small, we can simplify: x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) = **3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M**\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n    *   **pH = 8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
