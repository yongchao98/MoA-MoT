    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the problem statement.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\nThe mixture of gases from the decomposition was passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes reveal the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules in the gas phase, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):**\n    *   Volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP) = 2.24 liters.\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   To identify gas C, we can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂ = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   The gas with a molar mass of approximately 28 g/mol that is unreactive with the previous tubes is nitrogen (N₂). This is a common product in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe decomposition of the equimolar mixture of salts A and B yields 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂. The fact that only gases are formed suggests that the salts are likely ammonium salts of oxygen-containing acids. Let's consider common ammonium salts that decompose upon heating.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to nitrogen and water.\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition is complex and depends on temperature. At temperatures around 200°C, it can decompose into nitrous oxide and water, but under strong heating or with catalysts, it can decompose to nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Let `x` be the number of moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   **Decomposition of `x` mol of NH₄NO₂:**\n    `x` NH₄NO₂ → `x` N₂ + `2x` H₂O\n\n*   **Decomposition of `x` mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    `x` NH₄NO₃ → `x` N₂ + `0.5x` O₂ + `2x` H₂O (based on the 2:2:1:4 stoichiometry)\n\nNow, let's sum the products from both reactions:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `x` (from nitrite) + `x` (from nitrate) = `2x`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2x` (from nitrite) + `2x` (from nitrate) = `4x`\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `0.5x` (from nitrate) = `0.5x`\n\nThe ratio of the products is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = `2x` : `4x` : `0.5x` = 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nLet's compare this to the observed moles of products:\n*   N₂ = 0.10 mol\n*   H₂O = 0.20 mol\n*   O₂ = 0.025 mol\nThe observed ratio is 0.10 : 0.20 : 0.025, which simplifies to 4 : 8 : 1.\n\nThe theoretical and observed ratios match perfectly. We can now solve for `x` using the actual mole values:\n*   `0.5x` = 0.025 mol of O₂\n*   `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of Salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's verify the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g.\nThis is consistent with the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   The formula contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) **\n    *   The formula contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
