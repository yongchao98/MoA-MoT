    "A textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV absorbs red light. This conclusion is reached through a two-step process involving the determination of the emitted light's color and the principle of complementary colors.\n\nFirst, the energy of the emitted light is used to calculate its corresponding wavelength. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Converting the given energy of 2.3393 eV into joules and solving for the wavelength gives approximately 530 nanometers (nm).\n\nLight with a wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green portion of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the organic compound emits green light.\n\nThe color that a substance appears to be is determined by the wavelengths of light it reflects or transmits, not the ones it absorbs. An object that appears a certain color is absorbing the light of its complementary color. In the case of this textile dye, since it emits, and therefore appears, green, it must be absorbing the complementary color of green.\n\nOn the color wheel, the complementary color to green is red. While more precise definitions might pair green with magenta, in the common context of primary and secondary colors, red is the widely accepted complement to green. When the dye absorbs red light from the visible spectrum, the remaining light that is reflected or emitted is perceived by the human eye as green.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
