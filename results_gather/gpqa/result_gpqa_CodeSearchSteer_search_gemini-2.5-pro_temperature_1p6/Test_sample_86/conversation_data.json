    "### Analysis of the Compound\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula Information**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring and a total of 8 carbon atoms. The aromatic ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6), leaving 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents combined.\n2.  **FTIR Spectral Data**: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond is indicated. This means one substituent is a halogen (-X) attached directly to the aromatic ring, and the other substituent contains a carbonyl group.\n3.  **Determining the Structure**: To account for the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group, the second substituent must be an acetyl group (-COCH3). Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure has 6 carbons in the ring, plus 2 in the acetyl group, for a total of 8 carbons. It also has a halogen attached to the ring and a carbonyl group, fitting all the given information.\n\n### Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe structure is a di-substituted benzene, which can exist as ortho, meta, or para isomers. The ¹H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted)**: This is the most symmetrical isomer. Due to the plane of symmetry, there are only two types of aromatic protons. This leads to a characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2 protons (2H). The acetyl group (-COCH3) will appear as a singlet (s) since its three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. This peak typically appears around 2.3–2.6 ppm.\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution**: These less symmetrical isomers would result in more complex splitting patterns for the four aromatic protons, typically producing four distinct signals that might appear as multiplets, rather than a clean pair of doublets.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the predicted spectrum for *para*-halo-acetophenone with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. The methyl ketone protons (-CH3) are absent. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.0 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to B, this option lacks signals in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This is the classic AA'BB' pattern (often appearing as two doublets) for a *para*-substituted benzene ring, indicating 4 aromatic protons. The downfield chemical shifts are consistent with deshielding by two electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl and halogen).\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This signal is a singlet integrating to three protons with a chemical shift (~2.3-2.6 ppm) that perfectly matches a methyl ketone (-COCH3). For example, the methyl singlet in 4-chloroacetophenone is at 2.59 ppm, and in 4-bromoacetophenone, it is at 2.57 ppm.\n    *   This spectrum is fully consistent with a *para*-halo-acetophenone, such as 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only one that correctly represents the ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
