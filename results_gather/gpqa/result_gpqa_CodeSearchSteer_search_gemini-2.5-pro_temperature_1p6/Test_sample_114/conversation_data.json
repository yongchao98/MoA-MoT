    "This problem is solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   We have an electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺), which is the electron's antiparticle with the same mass but opposite charge.\n    *   The electron moves from the left with a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4.\n    *   The positron moves from the right with a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2.\n    *   The total initial energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the electron and positron. The energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where 'm' is the rest mass and 'c' is the speed of light.\n        *   Total Initial Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = (γ_e * mc²) + (γ_p * mc²) = (4 + 2)mc² = 6mc².\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The annihilation produces two photons (γ).\n    *   It is given that the two photons have equal energy (E_ph).\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons: E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2E_ph.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Equating the initial and final energy: 6mc² = 2E_ph.\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon: E_ph = 3mc².\n\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = γmv, but it's often easier to calculate using the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This gives p = (1/c) * sqrt(E² - (mc²)²).\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) in the positive x-direction:\n        *   p_e = (1/c) * sqrt((4mc²)² - (mc²)²) = (1/c) * sqrt(16m²c⁴ - m²c⁴) = (1/c) * sqrt(15m²c⁴) = sqrt(15)mc.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) in the negative x-direction:\n        *   p_p = (1/c) * sqrt((2mc²)² - (mc²)²) = (1/c) * sqrt(4m²c⁴ - m²c⁴) = (1/c) * sqrt(3m²c⁴) = sqrt(3)mc.\n    *   The total initial momentum is purely along the horizontal (x) axis:\n        *   P_initial = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mc.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_ph = E_ph / c.\n        *   p_ph = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. As the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) to the horizontal axis.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        *   P_final = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ).\n\n5.  **Equating Momenta and Finding the Angle:**\n    *   By the law of conservation of momentum, P_initial = P_final.\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mc = 6mc * cos(θ).\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n    *   Using the approximate values sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732:\n        *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568.\n    *   Solving for θ:\n        *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n        *   Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
