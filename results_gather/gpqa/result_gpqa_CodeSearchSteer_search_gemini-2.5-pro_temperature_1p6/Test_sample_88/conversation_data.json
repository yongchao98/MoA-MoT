    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with an excess of a strong base (KOH) at high temperature (240°C). These harsh conditions suggest that a simple substitution or elimination is unlikely. Instead, a complex rearrangement is expected. The provided analytical data for product 1 is:\n*   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The total of 14 protons indicates the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\nThe reaction likely proceeds through a series of rearrangements of the adamantane cage. While the exact structure of Product 1 and its unusual NMR spectrum are not straightforward to determine from common literature, the subsequent reaction steps provide the necessary clues.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1, a ketone, is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid like aluminum isopropoxide can also promote a subsequent dehydration reaction. This leads to the formation of an alkene. Therefore, the overall transformation is a one-pot reduction-dehydration, converting the ketone (Product 1) into an alkene (Product 2).\n\nKetone (C₁₀H₁₄O) ⟶ Alcohol ⟶ Alkene (C₁₀H₁₄)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2, an alkene, is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds, and the reductive workup ensures that aldehydes, if formed, are not oxidized to carboxylic acids. This reaction opens the cyclic structure of the alkene at the site of the double bond, resulting in a product with two carbonyl groups (Product 3, C₁₀H₁₄O₂).\n\n### Deducing the Structure and Coupling\n\nThe exact structure of the initial products is difficult to ascertain without more information. However, we can deduce the nature of the final product and solve the problem by considering the likely chemical transformations and the provided options.\n\n1.  **Nature of Product 3:** It is a dicarbonyl compound formed by cleaving a C=C bond within a polycyclic system. Depending on the substitution of the alkene, the product can be a diketone, a keto-aldehyde, or a dialdehyde.\n\n2.  **The Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule with ketone and/or aldehyde groups, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is almost always an aldehyde proton (-CHO), with a typical chemical shift of 9-10 ppm. Protons alpha to a carbonyl are less deshielded (2-4 ppm).\n\n3.  **Coupling Pattern:** The options provided are triplet, doublet of triplets, triplet of triplets, and pentet. A simple doublet, which would arise from an aldehyde proton coupled to a single proton on the alpha-carbon, is not an option. This suggests a more complex coupling environment.\n\n4.  **Long-Range Coupling:** In rigid polycyclic molecules, spin-spin coupling can occur over more than three bonds (long-range coupling), especially when the interacting protons have a 'W' or 'M' shaped arrangement. An aldehyde proton can exhibit such long-range coupling to protons four bonds away (⁴J coupling).\n\nLet's deduce the splitting pattern based on this:\n*   The most plausible reaction pathway for adamantane rearrangements leads to a product where ozonolysis creates a keto-aldehyde.\n*   The most deshielded proton is the aldehyde proton.\n*   This aldehyde proton will be coupled to the proton(s) on the alpha-carbon (³J coupling). A reasonable structure would have a single proton on the alpha-carbon, which would split the aldehyde signal into a **doublet**.\n*   This primary doublet signal would then be further split by long-range coupling (⁴J) to other nearby protons in the rigid cage. If the aldehyde proton is coupled to two other magnetically equivalent protons through a favorable long-range pathway, this would split the doublet into a **triplet**.\n\nTherefore, the final coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (the aldehyde proton) would be a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
