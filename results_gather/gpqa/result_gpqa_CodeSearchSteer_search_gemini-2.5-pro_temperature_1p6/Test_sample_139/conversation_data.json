    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Substance X and calculate the required value.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Substance X and Related Compounds\n\n*   **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope and reacts violently.** This points to a common laboratory reagent where isotopic labeling is used, likely a powerful reducing agent.\n*   **A gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Several gases fit this description, including Deuterium (D₂, ²H₂ - 2 protons, 2 neutrons), deuterated methane (CD₄ - 10 protons, 10 neutrons), and Nitrogen (N₂ - 14 protons, 14 neutrons). The violent reaction and heavy isotope clue make a deuterated reagent likely.\n*   **The reagent and its close analog are used in organic chemistry.** This strongly suggests powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   Let's assume **Substance X is LiAlD₄**. It contains the heavier isotope Deuterium (D). Its non-isotopic analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reagent. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water.\n*   If LiAlD₄ reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas with equal protons and neutrons, let's test possible reactions. If Y is normal water (H₂O), the gas is HD (2 protons, 1 neutron), which does not fit. However, if **Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**, the reaction is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    The gas released (W) is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n*   **A precipitate G is formed, which when heated, releases B.** In the reaction above, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would form as a precipitate (G). Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes decomposition:\n    2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O\n    This reaction releases heavy water, so **Substance B is D₂O**.\n*   **The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. Converting 277 Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is an excellent match.\n*   **The product of a keto acid reaction with X has 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols. For example, a generic keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH) would be reduced to a diol (R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH). This resulting diol product contains exactly two oxygen atoms.\n\nAll clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Mass\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), considering the sum of masses for all instances of those elements. For this calculation, we use the mass numbers (the total number of protons and neutrons) of the most common or specified isotopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄**: The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n2.  **Identify the specific isotopes**:\n    *   The problem specifies the presence of a heavier isotope of hydrogen, which we've identified as Deuterium (D or ²H). Its mass number is 2.\n    *   Aluminum's only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n    *   Lithium has two stable isotopes, ⁶Li and ⁷Li. ⁷Li is the most abundant (92.4%). Its mass number is 7.\n3.  **Determine the lightest and heaviest elements**:\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (atomic mass ~1 amu)\n    *   Intermediate element: Lithium (atomic mass ~7 amu)\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (atomic mass ~27 amu)\n4.  **Calculate the sum of masses for each required element as it appears in the formula LiAlD₄**:\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are four atoms, all of which are the Deuterium isotope (²H).\n      *   Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al).\n      *   Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n5.  **Calculate the final cumulative mass**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
