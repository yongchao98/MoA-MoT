    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n### 1. Understand the relationship between decay width and lifetime\n\nThe lifetime (τ) of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). This relationship is a consequence of the energy-time uncertainty principle and is given by the formula:\n\n*   τ = ħ / Γ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n### 2. Determine the particle's lifetime in its own rest frame (τ₀)\n\nFirst, we'll convert the given decay width (Γ_X) into GeV to maintain consistent units with the constants we will use.\n\n*   Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n*   The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s.\n\nNow, we can calculate the proper lifetime (τ₀), which is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame:\n\n*   τ₀ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / 0.320 GeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n### 3. Calculate the relativistic factors (Lorentz factor γ and beta β)\n\nDue to the high energy of the particle, we need to consider relativistic effects. The mean decay distance observed in the laboratory frame will be longer than it would be in the particle's rest frame due to time dilation.\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the particle's energy (E_X) to its rest mass energy (m_X):\n\n*   γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667\n\nThe factor beta (β) is the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (c), and it's related to γ by:\n\n*   β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √391 / 20 ≈ 0.9887\n\n### 4. Calculate the mean decay distance\n\nThe mean decay distance (d) in the laboratory frame is the particle's velocity (v = βc) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame (τ = γτ₀). A more direct formula combines these factors. A particularly useful form uses the product ħc (the reduced Planck constant times the speed of light), which is approximately 1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m.\n\nThe formula for the mean decay length (L) is:\n\n*   L = (p / m) * c * τ₀\nwhere 'p' is the momentum of the particle.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n*   L = (√[E_X² - m_X²] / m_X) * (ħc / Γ_X)\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n*   E_X = 8 GeV\n*   m_X = 1.2 GeV\n*   Γ_X = 0.320 GeV\n*   ħc ≈ 1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m\n\nFirst, calculate the term involving energy and mass:\n\n*   √[E_X² - m_X²] / m_X = √[8² - 1.2²] / 1.2 = √[64 - 1.44] / 1.2 = √62.56 / 1.2 ≈ 7.9095 / 1.2 ≈ 6.591\n\nNow, calculate the mean decay distance:\n\n*   d = 6.591 * ( (1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m) / 0.320 GeV )\n*   d ≈ 6.591 * (6.166 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n*   d ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result is very close to one of the given options.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
