    "In a universe with isolated magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles), two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified.\n\nFirst, Gauss's law for magnetism, which in our universe is ∇⋅B = 0, would be changed. This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which is a mathematical way of saying that magnetic poles always come in pairs (a north and a south). If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, meaning the divergence would be non-zero and proportional to the magnetic charge density. This affects the equation related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\nSecond, the movement of these magnetic monopoles would constitute a magnetic current. Just as a moving electric charge creates a magnetic field, a moving magnetic charge would create an electric field. This would require a modification to Faraday's Law of Induction, which would need an additional term to account for this magnetic current. Faraday's Law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a \"curl\" in the electric field, so this change affects the equation related to the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the ones governing the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
