    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands under the hypothetical scenario, a step-by-step analysis of the solar neutrino spectrum is necessary.\n\n### Breakdown of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reactions within the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The primary neutrino-producing reactions and their energy characteristics are:\n*   **pp-I Chain:** The initial `p + p` reaction produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with energies up to about 420 keV.\n*   **pp-II Chain:** This branch features the electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). This process creates mono-energetic neutrinos, with 90% of them at a sharp energy line of 861 keV and the remaining 10% at 383 keV.\n*   **pp-III Chain:** This branch involves the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos, up to about 15 MeV. This reaction is not a major source of energy in the Sun but is significant for producing high-energy neutrinos.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** Reactions involving Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen also produce neutrinos with continuous spectra. For instance, `¹³N` decay neutrinos reach up to 1.20 MeV and `¹⁵O` decay neutrinos up to 1.73 MeV.\n\nThe problem states that light and neutrinos take about 8.5 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth. Therefore, the hypothetical stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core 8.5 minutes ago means its effects are observable on Earth *now*.\n\n### Analyzing the Flux in Each Band\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the flux in two energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700 keV - 800 keV\n*   **Band 2:** 800 keV - 900 keV\n\nLet's analyze the neutrino sources in each band with and without the pp-III branch.\n\n1.  **Normal Operation (with pp-III branch):**\n    *   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** Neutrinos in this range come from the continuous spectrum of the `⁸B` decay (pp-III) and the CNO cycle.\n    *   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** The dominant source is the very strong, sharp `⁷Be` line at 861 keV from the pp-II branch. The continuous spectra from `⁸B` decay and the CNO cycle also contribute to the flux in this range.\n\n2.  **Hypothetical Scenario (pp-III branch stops):**\n    *   The stoppage of the pp-III branch means the flux from `⁸B` decay becomes zero across all energy levels.\n    *   All other reactions, including the entire pp-II chain and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio in the New Scenario\n\nWith the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, we are left with:\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** The only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`).\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** This band is now almost entirely dominated by the `⁷Be` mono-energetic line at 861 keV, a product of the unaffected pp-II branch. There is also a small contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\nBy examining a standard solar neutrino spectrum graph, we can compare the magnitudes of these remaining fluxes. The `⁷Be` line at 861 keV represents a very high flux, appearing as a tall, sharp spike. In contrast, the flux from the CNO cycle neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range is part of a low, continuous spectrum. The flux of the `⁷Be` line is significantly greater—by about two orders of magnitude (a factor of ~100)—than the CNO flux in the adjacent 700-800 keV band.\n\nTherefore, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV), dominated by the `⁷Be` line, will be substantially larger than the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV), which only contains the much weaker CNO contribution.\n\nThe ratio Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) will be approximately Flux(CNO) / Flux(`⁷Be`). Given the large difference in their respective fluxes, this ratio will be very small. A value of 0.01, or 10⁻², is the most plausible approximation for this ratio.\n\n<<<B>>>"
