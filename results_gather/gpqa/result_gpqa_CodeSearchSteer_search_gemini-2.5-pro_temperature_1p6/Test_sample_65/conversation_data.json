    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators, built from Standard Model fields, to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are required to respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\nBased on the foundational principles of SMEFT:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The operators in SMEFT are constructed to be invariant under the Poincaré group, which includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. This is a fundamental assumption in the construction of the theory.\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** As a consequence of being a local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, SMEFT respects CPT (Charge-conjugation, Parity, and Time-reversal) symmetry.\n*   **CP Symmetry:** In contrast, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT. The framework explicitly allows for new sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. Many studies focus on classifying and constraining these CP-violating operators.\n\nTherefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
