    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the substance A4 and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M_Y), the molar mass of fluorine (M_F ≈ 19 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is given by:\n    *M_Y ≈ n × M_F × (1/ωF - 1)*\n    *M_Y ≈ n × 19 × (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ n × 40.45*\n\n    We can test integer values for *n* (the oxidation state):\n    *   If n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol) or Selenium (Se, M=79.0 g/mol).\n    *   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=6, M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Incorporate Other Chemical Clues to Pinpoint Y.**\n    *   **Oxidation of Xenon:** Substance A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon under normal conditions. This requires an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent. Known examples include Krypton difluoride (KrF₂), and hexafluorides of elements like Platinum and Plutonium. Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃) is not strong enough. This narrows the possibilities, favoring Krypton or a heavy transition metal.\n    *   **Number of Compounds:** The problem states that five binary fluorides of Y are known. This is a key piece of information.\n        *   Uranium and Osmium are known to form five or more binary fluorides.\n        *   Krypton is only definitively known to form KrF₂. While KrF₄ is studied theoretically and has been claimed, the existence of five \"known\" binary compounds is questionable.\n        *   Antimony only forms two stable fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   **Color and Decomposition:** A1 is a \"bright-red\" substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C). Many of the potential candidates do not match this color description. For instance, KrF₄ is a colorless solid. This clue seems to contradict other evidence, suggesting it might be an error in the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Use the Molecular Weight Ranges to Eliminate Candidates.**\n    This is the most definitive step. We check if any of the fluorides of our candidate elements fall into the given MW ranges.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** M(PuF₃)=301, M(PuF₄)=320, M(PuF₆)=358. None fit the ranges.\n    *   **Uranium (U):** M(UF₃)=295, M(UF₄)=314, M(UF₅)=333, M(UF₆)=352. None fit the ranges.\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** M(SbF₃)=178.8 g/mol. This falls into range A (160-180). However, as established, Sb fails on the key chemical clues (number of compounds, oxidizing power).\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** The known molecular fluorides are KrF₂ and KrF₄.\n        *   M(KrF₂) = 121.8 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **B) 110-130**.\n        *   M(KrF₄) = 159.8 g/mol. This falls squarely in range **D) 140-160**.\n\n4.  **Final Identification of A4.**\n    The fact that the molecular weights of krypton's fluorides match the given ranges perfectly, while those of other strong candidates do not, makes Krypton the only viable answer, despite the inconsistencies regarding the number of compounds and color. We must now determine if A4 is KrF₂ or KrF₄.\n\n    *   The problem states A4 exists in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\"\n    *   Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) is extremely unstable and decomposes at temperatures well below room temperature (around -38 °C). Therefore, preparing a \"hot\" solution of it is chemically impossible.\n    *   Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is more stable (decomposing around 60°C) and can exist in solution.\n    *   Therefore, A4 must be KrF₂. The molecular weight of KrF₂ is 121.8 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The substance A4 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂), which has a molecular weight of 121.8 g/mol. This value falls within the 110-130 range.\n\n<<<B>>>"
