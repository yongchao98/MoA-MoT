    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we use the method of images. A charge *q* placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces an image charge, which allows for the calculation of the potential and force.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere itself is an equipotential surface with a potential of zero. The effect of the induced surface charge can be modeled by a single image charge *q'* located within the sphere along the line connecting the center and the external charge *q*.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is at a distance `d' = R²/d` from the center.\n\n2.  **Force between Charge and Sphere**: The force between the real charge *q* and the grounded sphere is equivalent to the force between the real charge *q* and its image *q'*. Since *q* and *q'* have opposite signs, this is an attractive force.\n\n3.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to its position at distance *d* from the center of the sphere. This is calculated by integrating the force on the charge with respect to distance.\n\n    The force F on the charge *q* at a distance *x* from the center is the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at a distance `x' = R²/x`. The distance between the real and image charge is `x - x' = x - R²/x = (x² - R²)/x`.\n\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')² = k * q * (-qR/x) / ((x² - R²)/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\n    The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to *d*, which is the negative of the work done by the field:\n    `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[d to ∞] -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)² dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, let `u = x² - R²`, which means `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = -k * q² * R / 2 * ∫[d²-R² to ∞] du/u²`\n    `U = -k * q² * R / 2 * [-1/u] |_[d²-R² to ∞]`\n    `U = -k * q² * R / 2 * (0 - (-1/(d² - R²)))`\n    `U = -k * q² * R / (2 * (d² - R²))`\n\n    This can also be expressed as half the potential energy of interaction between the real charge and the final image charge.\n\n    The final derived formula is:\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
