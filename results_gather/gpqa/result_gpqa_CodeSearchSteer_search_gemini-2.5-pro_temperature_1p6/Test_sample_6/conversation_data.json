    "The annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$) is a key process that limits the distance very high-energy gamma rays can travel in the universe. To determine the energy threshold for this interaction, we can use the principles of special relativity.\n\nThe reaction is:\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nFor this process to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the resulting electron-positron pair.\n\n**1. Energy and Momentum Conservation:**\nLet $E_\\gamma$ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $\\epsilon$ be the energy of the CMB photon. The rest mass energy of an electron is denoted by $m_e c^2$. Since an electron and a positron have the same mass, the minimum energy required to create the pair is $2m_e c^2$.\n\nThe rest mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². Therefore, the total rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair is about 1.022 MeV.\n\n**2. Threshold Energy Calculation:**\nThe threshold energy is the minimum energy $E_\\gamma$ required for the reaction. This minimum occurs for a head-on collision between the high-energy photon and the CMB photon. The condition for the threshold energy is derived from the invariance of the square of the four-momentum:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\epsilon = (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nThis formula relates the energies of the two photons to the rest mass energy of the electron.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray, $E_\\gamma$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare this with the given options, we convert the energy from electronvolts (eV) to gigaelectronvolts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to the value given in option C. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies around and above this threshold will have their lifetimes significantly limited by annihilation with CMB photons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
