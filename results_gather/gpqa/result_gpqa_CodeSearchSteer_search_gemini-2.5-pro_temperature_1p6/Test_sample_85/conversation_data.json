    "The provided problem requires identifying the correct stereoisomers of a starting material that, upon reaction with two different reducing agents, yield specific stereoisomers of a lactone product.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It also has a chiral center at the third carbon (C3), where the ethyl group is attached.\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The formation of this lactone requires a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and a hydroxyl group separated by three carbons (a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid). The reduction step in each reaction is responsible for creating this necessary hydroxyl group. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) corresponds to the C4 position in the lactone product. Since the reactions do not involve breaking or forming bonds at this chiral center, its stereochemical configuration (R or S) is retained from the starting material to the product.\n\n#### **Reaction A:**\n**A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is first deprotonated by the hydride to form a lithium carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction, while the ester group is reduced to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group on the starting material to a primary alcohol. The molecule then becomes a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. Subsequent treatment with acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is the (R)-lactone. Since the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n#### **Reaction B:**\n**B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent highly chemoselective for carboxylic acids, reducing them preferentially over esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. This forms a 5-hydroxy ester intermediate. Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification to yield the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is the (S)-lactone. As the stereochemistry is preserved throughout the reaction, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents and the principle of stereochemical retention at the chiral center:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
