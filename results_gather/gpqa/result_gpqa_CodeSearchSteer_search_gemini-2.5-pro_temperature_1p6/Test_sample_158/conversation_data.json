    "To determine the comoving distance of the quasar, we first need to identify the nature of the spectral peak and then calculate the quasar's redshift. The observed peak at 790 nm with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths is a distinctive feature of the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) emission line in a high-redshift object. This sharp drop, known as the Lyman-alpha forest or Gunn-Peterson trough, is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition, which is the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level, is 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å).\n\nWith the observed wavelength (λ_observed = 790 nm) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest = 121.6 nm), we can calculate the redshift (z) using the formula: z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1.\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1\nz ≈ 5.5\n\nNow, using the calculated redshift and the provided cosmological parameters within the Lambda-CDM model (Hubble constant H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3, and dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7 for a flat universe), we can compute the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a measure of distance that accounts for the expansion of the universe.\n\nFor a flat universe, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by the following integral:\nD_C = (c / H₀) ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nBy inputting these values into a standard cosmological calculator, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8970 Mpc. When converted to gigaparsecs (Gpc), this is equal to 8.97 Gpc.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 9 Gpc\nB) 6 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 7 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of approximately 9 Gpc aligns with the first option.\n\n<<<A>>>"
