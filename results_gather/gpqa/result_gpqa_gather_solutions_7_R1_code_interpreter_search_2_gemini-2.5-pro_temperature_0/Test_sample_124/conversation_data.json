Identify the Physical System\nThe problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the oscillatory frequency $\\omega$ is the same in all three dimensions.\n\n### 2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe Hamiltonian for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$) because the potential can be written as $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This means the system behaves like three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies from the three independent dimensions:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels can be expressed more compactly as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### 3. Find the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** Corresponds to the lowest possible energy, $n=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=1$.

This immediately eliminates options A and C.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (i.e., combinations of $n_x, n_y, n_z$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy ($g_n$) of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states.\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states.\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (the degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.

This is the standard potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ is the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   The energy levels are indexed by $n$:\n        *   Ground State: $n=0$, Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   First Excited State: $n=1$, Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   Second Excited State: $n=2$, Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$, Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   This result for the energy, $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, is correctly derived in all candidate answers that use the appropriate formula.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share that energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to counting the number of different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level is $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For $n=3$, the degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be confirmed by listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The single state (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    *   Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level. This result is also consistently reached by all candidate answers.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Correct Potential:** The energy formula used must correspond to the harmonic oscillator potential. The energy expression $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$ seen in options A and C is characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and is incorrect for this problem.\n*   **Indexing of States:** It is crucial to remember that the ground state corresponds to $n=0$.

This is the standard potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ is the sum of the quantum numbers for each Cartesian dimension: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   The energy levels are indexed by $n$:\n        *   Ground State: $n=0$, Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   First Excited State: $n=1$, Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   Second Excited State: $n=2$, Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n        *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3$, Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   This result for the energy, $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, is correctly derived in all candidate answers that use the appropriate formula.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share that energy eigenvalue.

This result is also consistently reached by all candidate answers.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Correct Potential:** The energy formula used must correspond to the harmonic oscillator potential. The energy expression $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$ seen in options A and C is characteristic of a different system (the infinite spherical well) and is incorrect for this problem.\n*   **Indexing of States:** It is crucial to remember that the ground state corresponds to $n=0$. Consequently, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly calculate the energy to be $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy to be 10. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (e.g., <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, <<<D>>>) is due to them being presented with different orderings of the same options. The underlying physics conclusion is unanimous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the provided options:\n\n*   A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy.\n*   B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 - **Correct energy and degeneracy.**\n*   C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n*   D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical System and its Properties\nThe problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for motion along all three Cartesian axes.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy eigenvalue, $E$, is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators.\nThe energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the 3D system, the total energy is:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy formula simplifies to:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### Step 3: Find the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** Corresponds to the lowest energy, $n=0$. $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=1$. $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=2$. $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=3$. $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is therefore $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have an incorrect energy formula.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (i.e., combinations of $n_x, n_y, n_z$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nAlternatively, we can list the combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 states.\n2.  One is 2, one is 1, one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → 6 states.\n3.  All three are 1: (1,1,1) → 1 state.\nThe total number of states is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is equal to the degeneracy, which is 10.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n*   B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n*   C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n*   D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n\nThe correct option is A. All the candidate answers correctly calculated these values, although some made errors in selecting the corresponding letter from the options. The physics and mathematics are unambiguous.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
