Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe first step is to find the number of moles of the reactive species (H⁺ from acids and OH⁻ from the base) before they are mixed.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to provide **two** hydroxide ions for every one formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This factor of 2 is crucial.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with and neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). The reaction goes to completion because a strong base is involved.\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Compare total acid and total base:**\n    *   Total Moles of Base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n    *   Total Moles of Acid (H⁺) = 0.130 mol\n*   Since the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n*   **Calculate the moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = Total Moles OH⁻ - Total Moles Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH.**\nThe pH of the final solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The question asks for the **pH**, not the pOH.

The candidate answers show a consensus on the calculation method but differ in their final selection, highlighting several critical points that require careful attention.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the Initial Moles of Acidic and Basic Species**\n\nThe first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of each reactive species being mixed.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   As a strong acid, HCl dissociates completely.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   As a strong base, Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n\n**Careful Point #1: Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂**\nBarium hydroxide is a dihydroxic base, meaning each formula unit releases two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This is a crucial detail.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Perform Neutralization Stoichiometry**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ equivalents):**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Compare total acid and total base:**\n    *   Total Moles of Base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n    *   Total Moles of Acid (H⁺) = 0.130 mol\n*   Since the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n*   **Calculate the moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = Total Moles OH⁻ - Total Moles Acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH**\n\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n**Careful Point #2: Distinguishing pOH from pH**\nThe calculated value of 1.38 is the pOH, not the pH. Option A is 1.38, making this a potential trap. The question asks for the pH.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   Using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step calculation confirms that the final pH of the solution is 12.62. All the candidate answers that show their work arrive at this same numerical result. The discrepancies arise from two main errors:\n1.  Mistaking the calculated pOH (1.38) for the final pH.\n2.  Incorrectly matching the correct pH value (12.62) to the corresponding letter option.\n\nThe correct pH is 12.62, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this acid-base chemistry problem by first calculating the initial moles of all acidic and basic species involved. Then, I will determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reaction. Finally, I will calculate the concentration of the excess species in the final volume and use that to determine the pH of the solution.

Barium hydroxide provides two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This factor of 2 is crucial.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.300 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.180 mol.\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:**\n    *   The strong base will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n    *   Total moles of acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol.\n    *   Total moles of base = 0.180 mol.\n    *   Since moles of base (0.180) > moles of acid (0.130), the base is in excess.\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of excess OH⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The calculation from [OH⁻] gives pOH first. The question asks for pH.\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The calculated pH is 12.62.\n    *   The calculated pOH is 1.38.\n    *   Looking at the options: A) 1.38, B) 12.62, C) 8.92, D) 8.68.\n    *   The correct option is B.

Calculate the final pH.**\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the final volume.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Careful Point #2:** This value, 1.38, is the pOH, not the pH. It is listed as option A and is a common distractor.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point #3:** The relationship pH + pOH = 14 must be used to find the final pH.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step calculation shows the final pH of the solution is **12.62**. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62\nD) 8.92\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows that nearly all of them performed the calculation correctly and arrived at the pH value of 12.62. However, many failed in the final step of matching this value to the correct letter, with some choosing the pOH value (A) and others making random errors. The chemical calculation is sound and consistently points to 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
