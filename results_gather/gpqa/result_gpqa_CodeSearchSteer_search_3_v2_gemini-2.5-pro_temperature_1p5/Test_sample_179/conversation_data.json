    "The minimum energy of the system of 13 identical charges is `2.822 x 10^-26` Joules. This is determined by calculating the total electrostatic potential energy of the configuration.\n\nThe total energy of this system is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interactions between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface.\n\nFor the system to have minimum energy, the 12 charges on the surface must arrange themselves into a configuration of lowest potential energy. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the solution is that they reside at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n**1. Energy of Central-Surface Interaction:**\n\nEach of the 12 particles on the surface has a charge `q = 2e` and is at a distance `r = 2 m` from the central charge, also `q = 2e`. The potential energy `U_cs` is calculated as follows:\n*   Charge `q = 2 * e = 2 * (1.602 x 10^-19 C) = 3.204 x 10^-19 C`.\n*   Coulomb's constant `k ≈ 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n*   The potential energy between the central charge and one surface charge is `U_pair = k * q² / r`.\n*   With 12 such particles, `U_cs = 12 * (k * q² / r)`.\n*   `U_cs = 12 * ( (8.988 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19)² / 2 ) ≈ 5.537 x 10^-27` Joules.\n\n**2. Energy of Surface-Surface Interaction:**\n\nThe potential energy of the 12 charges arranged in an icosahedron (`U_ss`) is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of these charges. An icosahedron has 12 vertices, and the distances between them fall into three categories for a sphere of radius `r=2m`:\n*   **30 pairs** of nearest neighbors at a distance `d_1 ≈ 2.103 m`.\n*   **30 pairs** of next-nearest neighbors at a distance `d_2 ≈ 3.403 m`.\n*   **6 antipodal pairs** at a distance `d_3 = 2 * r = 4 m`.\n\nThe total potential energy for this surface configuration is given by the sum over all pairs:\n*   `U_ss = k * q² * (30/d_1 + 30/d_2 + 6/d_3)`.\n*   `U_ss ≈ (8.988 x 10^9) * (3.204 x 10^-19)² * (30/2.103 + 30/3.403 + 6/4.0)`.\n*   `U_ss ≈ 2.269 x 10^-26` Joules.\n\n**Total Minimum Energy:**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n`U_total ≈ 5.537 x 10^-27 J + 2.269 x 10^-26 J`\n`U_total ≈ 0.5537 x 10^-26 J + 2.269 x 10^-26 J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8227 x 10^-26` Joules.\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.822 x 10^-26` J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
