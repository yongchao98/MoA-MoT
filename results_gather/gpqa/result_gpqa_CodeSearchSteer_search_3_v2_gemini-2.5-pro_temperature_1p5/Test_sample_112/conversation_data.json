    "To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry must be analyzed in conjunction with the possible chemical formulas.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   Another strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, suggesting the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinylic protons typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule that is a carboxylic acid and also contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires the presence of two oxygen atoms (-COOH) and at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the given formulas to see which one fits the structural features identified.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. A single degree of unsaturation cannot account for both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid containing a double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. While this has two degrees of unsaturation, it only has one oxygen atom and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which accommodates both a C=O bond and a C=C bond. It also has two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that aligns with all the provided data: two oxygens for the carboxylic acid, and two degrees of unsaturation for the carbonyl group and the alkene C=C double bond. The FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data all support the identification of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
