    "Here is a detailed analysis of the products of each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The incoming hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3 (R or S). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the products are diastereomers.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Result of Reaction I:** A mixture of two compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a standard reagent for reducing ketones to alcohols. Since it is used in excess, both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, resulting in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. There are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (This is a *meso* compound, as it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral).\n*   **Result of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers, which have different physical properties.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are **diastereomers**. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The **enantiomers** ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on a normal-phase column and will elute as a **single peak**.\n    *   The ***meso*** **compound** is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules with different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers form temporary diastereomeric complexes with the CSP, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  *meso*-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nAll five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct and will have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the others, will also elute as a distinct peak. Since all five compounds in the mixture are different stereoisomers, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
