    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Compound A**\n\nThe proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals: a triplet for 6 hydrogens (6H) and a quartet for 4 hydrogens (4H). This 3:2 hydrogen ratio and the triplet-quartet splitting pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃-CH₂-). In a simple acyclic molecule, the most plausible structure that fits this description is n-butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃). The two outer methyl (CH₃) groups are equivalent (6H) and are split by the adjacent methylene (CH₂) group, resulting in a triplet. The two inner methylene (CH₂) groups are also equivalent (4H) and are split by the adjacent methyl (CH₃) group, giving a quartet. While the coupling between the two methylene groups would create a more complex pattern in a high-resolution spectrum, \"triplet and quartet\" is a common simplification for n-butane in textbook problems.\n\n*   **Compound A is n-butane.**\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Compound B**\n\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction. Bromination is selective and will preferentially substitute a hydrogen on the carbon atom that forms the most stable free radical. In n-butane, there are primary hydrogens (at C1 and C4) and secondary hydrogens (at C2 and C3). A secondary radical is more stable than a primary radical. Therefore, the major product will be 2-bromobutane.\n\n*   **Compound B is 2-bromobutane.**\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Compound C**\n\nCompound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction that results in an elimination (E2) reaction, forming an alkene. The reaction follows Zaitsev's rule, which states that the more substituted alkene will be the major product. Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form but-1-ene (less substituted) or but-2-ene (more substituted). Thus, but-2-ene is the major product. The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (*cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene).\n\n*   **Compound C is but-2-ene.**\n\n**Step 4: Identification of Compound D**\n\nCompound D is formed from the reaction of the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n*   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n*   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene\n\nThe reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants:\n1.  **From the dienophile**: The use of *cis*-but-2-ene means that the two methyl groups added to the new ring (at positions C5 and C6) must be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n2.  **From the diene**: The use of an (E,E)-diene means that the substituents on the ends of the diene (the -OH group at C1 and the -CH3 group at C4) will be *trans* to each other in the product.\n\nThe product is a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol. We can eliminate options A and C because they have a \"4,6,6-trimethyl\" substitution pattern, which is incorrect. We are left with options B and D.\n\nWe must now analyze the stereochemical descriptors:\n*   We need the two methyl groups at C5 and C6 to be *cis*. This relative configuration corresponds to an (R,S) or (S,R) pairing.\n*   We need the -OH group at C1 and the methyl group at C4 to be *trans*. This relative configuration corresponds to an (R,R) or (S,S) pairing.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **B) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n    *   (1S, 4R) indicates a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C1 and C4. This matches our requirement.\n    *   (5S, 6R) indicates a *cis* relationship between the substituents at C5 and C6. This matches our requirement.\n*   **D) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n    *   (1S, 4R) indicates a *trans* relationship. This is correct.\n    *   (5S, 6S) indicates a *trans* relationship between the substituents at C5 and C6. This is incorrect, as our dienophile was *cis*.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
