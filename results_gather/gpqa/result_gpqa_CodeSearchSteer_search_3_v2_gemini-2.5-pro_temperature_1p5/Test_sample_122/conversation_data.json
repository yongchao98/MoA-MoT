    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the given information:\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that has passed in the ejecta's frame of reference is 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it is the time measured in the moving frame.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** For this calculation, we will use the approximate value c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Understand the goal:\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this, we need to determine how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame, which will be different from the time passed in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\nThe Lorentz factor is essential for calculations in special relativity. The formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β):\nβ = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √(0.96)\nγ ≈ 1.02062\n\n### 4. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):\nTime dilation means that for a stationary observer (the Galaxy), time appears to pass more slowly for the moving object (the ejecta). The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) is related to the proper time (Δt₀) by the formula:\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nUsing the values we have:\nΔt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\nΔt ≈ 51.031 s\n\n### 5. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d):\nFinally, calculate the distance traveled by multiplying the ejecta's velocity (as measured in the Galaxy's frame) by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\nd = v * Δt\n\nUsing the values:\nd = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\nd ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nThis result is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n### Alternative Method: Using Length Contraction\n\n1.  **Consider the ejecta's reference frame.** In this frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. The time elapsed is Δt₀ = 50 s.\n2.  **Calculate the distance.** The distance the Galaxy's center travels in the ejecta's frame is:\n    d' = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n3.  **Apply length contraction.** This distance, `d'`, is a \"contracted length\" because it's measured in a frame that is moving relative to the \"proper length.\" The proper length (d) is the distance in the Galaxy's rest frame. The formula for length contraction is `L = L₀ / γ`. In our case, `d' = d / γ`.\n4.  **Solve for the proper distance (d):**\n    d = d' * γ\n    d = 3,000,000 km * 1.02062\n    d ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The calculated distance is approximately 3,060,000 km, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
