    "Based on the mechanistic analysis of the two reactions, the major products are determined as follows:\n\n**Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) → A**\n\nThis reaction proceeds via a sophisticated, well-documented cascade mechanism.\n1.  **Alkoxide Formation:** The strong base, potassium hydride (KH), deprotonates the tertiary alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide. The use of a base to form an alkoxide greatly accelerates the subsequent rearrangement.\n2.  **Anionic Oxy-Cope Rearrangement:** The reactant, a 1,5-dien-3-ol derivative, is perfectly set up for a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the oxy-Cope rearrangement. The anionic nature (due to the alkoxide) makes the reaction rapid and generally irreversible. This step involves the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond and the formation of a new one, expanding the initial spirocyclic system into a larger 10-membered ring enolate intermediate.\n3.  **Transannular Ene Reaction:** The 10-membered ring intermediate is conformationally flexible and undergoes a subsequent intramolecular (transannular) ene reaction. This second rearrangement forms a new carbon-carbon bond across the ring, resulting in a bridged bicyclic system.\n4.  **Tautomerization:** Upon acidic workup (H+), the enolate intermediate from the oxy-Cope step tautomerizes to form the final, stable ketone product.\n\nThis specific tandem anionic oxy-Cope/transannular ene reaction sequence for spirocyclic vinyl alcohols is known to produce bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane skeletons. Therefore, product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) → B**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.\n1.  **Alkoxide and Ester Formation:** First, the strong base, lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), deprotonates the alcohol to form a lithium alkoxide. This alkoxide then reacts with acetyl bromide in an esterification reaction to form an allyl acetate, (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** LDA, being a very strong base, then deprotonates the carbon alpha to the ester's carbonyl group, creating a lithium enolate. This specific intermediate, a lithium enolate of an allyl ester, is the key reactant for the subsequent rearrangement.\n3.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement (Ireland-Claisen):** The lithium enolate undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic rearrangement. This involves the breaking of the oxygen-allyl carbon bond and the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, ultimately leading to a chain-extended carboxylic acid derivative.\n4.  **Final Product:** The rearrangement directly produces the lithium salt of the carboxylic acid. As no acidic workup is specified to neutralize the product, the final product remains as the salt. Tracing the connectivity of the atoms through the rearrangement reveals the structure to be **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing these results to the given options:\n*   **A** = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one\n*   **B** = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
