    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have zero rest mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\nE_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (ν):\nE_final = E_μ + E_ν\nWhere E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ*c² (KE_μ is the kinetic energy of the muon) and E_ν = KE_ν (since the neutrino's rest mass is zero).\n\nBy conservation of energy:\n139.6 MeV = (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV) + KE_ν\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 - 105.7\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.\np_μ = -p_ν\nThe magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n**3. Calculation**\nWe can calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) which is equal to its momentum times the speed of light (p*c). The formula derived from energy and momentum conservation is:\n\nKE_ν = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π*c²) ]\nKE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nKE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) using the energy conservation equation from step 1:\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\nKE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These results are confirmed by multiple physics resources. For example, one source measures the muon's kinetic energy to be 4.13 MeV. Another calculation provides values of 4.08 MeV for the muon and 29.65 MeV for the neutrino, which are very close to our findings.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
