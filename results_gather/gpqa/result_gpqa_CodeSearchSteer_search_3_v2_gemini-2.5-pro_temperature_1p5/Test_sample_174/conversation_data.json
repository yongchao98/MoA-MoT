    "An oscillating charge distribution that is small compared to the wavelength of radiation can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. A spheroid shape with oscillations along the symmetry z-axis fits this model.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n\nThe radiated power is at its maximum, `A`, when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`. Therefore, the maximum power `A` is radiated perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we calculate the ratio:\n\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = `(C * sin²(30°)) / (C * sin²(90°))`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `sin(90°) = 1`, the fraction is:\n\nFraction = `(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4`\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴) and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (λ⁻⁴). This relationship arises from the fundamental principles of electrodynamics and is a key feature of dipole radiation. The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, therefore has a λ⁻⁴ dependence.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
