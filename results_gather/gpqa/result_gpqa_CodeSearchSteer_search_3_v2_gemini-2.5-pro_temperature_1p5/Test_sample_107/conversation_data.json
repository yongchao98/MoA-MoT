    "To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the given transition energy, we must first calculate the value of each term.\n\n### 1. Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩\n\nThe energy of the paramagnetic coupling (also known as the Zeeman effect) is given by the formula:\n\n<span>$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B $$</span>\n\nWhere:\n*   **m** is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies to use a small value, so we will use m = 1.\n*   **B** is the magnitude of the magnetic field, given as 1 Tesla (T).\n*   **μ_B** is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274 x 10⁻²⁴ J/T or, more conveniently for this problem, about 5.788 x 10⁻⁵ eV/T.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:\n\n<span>$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\text{ T} $$</span>\n<span>$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $$</span>\n\n### 2. Transition Energy ΔE\n\nThe transition energy (ΔE) of a photon is related to its wavelength (λ) by the Planck-Einstein relation. The formula to find the energy in electron volts (eV) from the wavelength in micrometers (μm) is:\n\n<span>$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$</span>\n\nWhere:\n*   **h** is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **c** is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   **λ** is the given wavelength, 0.4861 μm, which is equal to 486.1 nm or 4.861 x 10⁻⁷ m.\n\nA common and useful shortcut for this calculation is the formula:\n\n<span>$$ \\Delta E \\text{ (eV)} \\approx \\frac{1240}{\\lambda \\text{ (nm)}} $$</span>\n\nUsing the given wavelength:\n\n<span>$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{1240}{486.1} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $$</span>\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the hydrogen-beta line in the Balmer series, which is the electron transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level.\n\n### 3. Comparison\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n\n*   **Paramagnetic coupling energy ⟨H⟩** ≈ 5.788 x 10⁻⁵ eV\n*   **Transition energy ΔE** ≈ 2.55 eV\n\nTo see the difference in their order of magnitude, we can take their ratio:\n\n<span>$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle} \\approx \\frac{2.55}{5.788 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 44000 $$</span>\n\nThis shows that the transition energy ΔE is approximately 44,000 times larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy ⟨H⟩ for a magnetic field of 1 Tesla. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n\n<span>$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$</span>\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
