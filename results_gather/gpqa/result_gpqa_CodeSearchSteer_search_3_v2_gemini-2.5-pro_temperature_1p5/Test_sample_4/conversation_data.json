    "The problem asks for the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator for a muon along a specific direction, corresponding to the positive eigenvalue. Let's outline the steps to solve this.\n\n1.  **Define the Spin Operator:** The operator $\\vec{P}$ is described by its components, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    This is the standard spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted as $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:** The arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized using the standard spherical coordinate angle $\\theta$ (the polar angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi=0$ (for the x-z plane).\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator in Direction $\\vec{n}$:** The operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:** We need to find the eigenvector $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the equation $P_{\\vec{n}}\\chi = \\lambda\\chi$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Canceling $\\hbar/2$ from both sides, we get a system of linear equations:\n    1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:** Let's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$.\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities, $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b (2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a (2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\theta \\neq 0$, we can divide by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, the eigenvector has the form $\\chi = k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some constant $k$. A convenient choice is $k = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, which gives the unnormalized eigenvector as $\\chi' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:** The norm squared of the eigenvector must be 1.\n    $|\\chi'|^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The eigenvector is already normalized.\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This result is a standard formula for the spin-up state in an arbitrary direction defined by the angle $\\theta$ from the z-axis.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect. Eigenvectors representing quantum states are dimensionless, and the presence of $\\hbar$ makes this option dimensionally incorrect.\n*   B) Correct. The calculated elements match this option.\n*   C) Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and lacks the necessary dependence on the angle $\\theta$.\n*   D) Incorrect. The angular dependence is on $\\theta$ rather than $\\theta/2$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
