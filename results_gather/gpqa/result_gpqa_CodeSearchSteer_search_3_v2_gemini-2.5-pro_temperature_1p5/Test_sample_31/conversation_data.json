    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus (³Li), we must first calculate its rest energy and then apply the principles of special relativity to account for its high velocity.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Nucleus and its Rest Mass\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Since Lithium's atomic number is 3 (meaning it has 3 protons), the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. This identifies the nucleus as Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\nThe rest mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus (without its electrons) is given as 6.0134771 atomic mass units (u).\n\n### 2. Calculating the Rest Energy (E₀)\nThe rest energy is calculated using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, E = mc². First, we convert the nuclear mass from atomic mass units (u) to MeV/c²:\n\n*   1 atomic mass unit (u) = 931.5 MeV/c².\n*   Rest mass of ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) = 6.0134771 u.\n*   Rest energy (E₀) = 6.0134771 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u\n*   E₀ ≈ 5601.559 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculating the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor (gamma) accounts for relativistic effects at high speeds. It is calculated based on the given velocity v = 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n\n*   The formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   v²/c² = (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculating the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy of the moving nucleus is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   Total Energy (E) = γ * E₀\n*   E = 3.5714 * 5601.559 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20005.3 MeV\n\nTo express the final answer in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), we divide by 1000:\n\n*   E ≈ 20.0053 GeV\n\nGiven the requested precision of 1e-4, this value is approximately 20.0053 GeV. Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest value is 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy may arise from using slightly different values for the physical constants (mass of ⁶Li or the conversion factor from u to MeV/c²). However, based on the standard values, the calculated energy is nearest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
