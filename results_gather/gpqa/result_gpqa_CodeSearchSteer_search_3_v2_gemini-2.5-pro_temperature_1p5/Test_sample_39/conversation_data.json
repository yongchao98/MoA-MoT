    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, chemists routinely use a technique called chromatography to separate and purify the compounds they have made. The most common forms are thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography.\n\nIn these techniques, a mixture of compounds is passed through a stationary phase (often silica gel, which is polar) by a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). The separation of the compounds is based on their differing affinities for the stationary and mobile phases. A key property that governs this affinity is polarity.\n\nWhen a chemist says their \"compounds are on top of each other,\" it is a common way of describing a failed separation by chromatography. Specifically:\n\n*   **In Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** The different compounds in a mixture are expected to travel up the TLC plate at different rates, resulting in distinct spots at different heights. If the compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, and their spots will overlap, appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **In Column Chromatography:** This technique is used to separate larger quantities of material. The compounds are expected to move through the column at different rates and be collected in separate fractions. When compounds have similar polarities, they \"co-elute,\" meaning they exit the column at the same time and are not successfully separated. A chromatogram of such a separation would show overlapping peaks.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the fact that their desired product and impurities (or multiple products) have very similar polarities, making them difficult to separate using standard chromatographic methods.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options in this context:\n\n*   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules and is not the basis for common separation techniques like silica gel chromatography.\n*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This directly leads to poor separation in the most common purification techniques used in a synthetic organic chemistry lab.\n*   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is characteristic of a chromatographic separation.\n*   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While these interactions are fundamental to how chromatography works, the issue isn't that the compounds are necessarily stuck to each other, but that they each interact with the chromatography medium in a very similar way due to their similar polarities.\n\nThus, the most accurate interpretation of the chemist's complaint is that the compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
