    "The user wants to find the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots compared to when it does not.\n\n### 1. Identify the Governing Principle\nThe population of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. For two energy levels, 1 and 2, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in each level is given by:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₁, N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2.\n*   g₁, g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels (which we can assume are constant for the atom).\n*   E₁, E₂ are the energies of the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Define the Ratios\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes between the unspotted and spotted star. Let's define the two conditions:\n*   **Unspotted:** Temperature T_unspotted = 6000 K\n*   **Spotted:** Temperature T_spotted = 5500 K\n\nThe ratio for the unspotted star is:\nR_unspotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)]\n\nThe ratio for the spotted star is:\nR_spotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)]\n\nwhere ΔE = E₂ - E₁.\n\nThe desired factor is F = R_unspotted / R_spotted.\n\nF = ( (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_unspotted)] ) / ( (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k*T_spotted)] )\n\nThe term with the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nF = exp[-ΔE / (k*T_unspotted)] / exp[-ΔE / (k*T_spotted)]\nF = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) ]\nF = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\nThe energy of a photon corresponding to a transition between two levels is related to its wavelength (λ) by the Planck relation.\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (~3.0 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term ΔE/k:\n\nΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\nΔE/k = ( (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) ) / ( (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) * (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K) )\nΔE/k ≈ (1.9878 × 10⁻²⁵ J·m) / (1.99824 × 10⁻³⁰ J·m/K)\nΔE/k ≈ 99478 K\n\n### 4. Calculate the Temperature Term\nNext, we calculate the term related to the temperatures:\n\n(1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) = (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K)\n(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000)\n= 500 / 33,000,000 K⁻¹\n≈ 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Factor (F)\nNow, we can substitute the calculated values back into the expression for the factor F:\n\nF = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ]\nF = exp[ 99478 * (1.515 × 10⁻⁵) ]\nF = exp(1.507)\nF ≈ 4.51\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is extra data that describes a physically consistent scenario but is not needed for the final calculation.\n\nThe ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energetic levels is about 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when 40% of its surface is covered by spots.\n\n<<<A>>>"
