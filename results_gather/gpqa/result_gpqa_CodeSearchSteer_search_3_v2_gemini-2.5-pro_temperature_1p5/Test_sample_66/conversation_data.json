    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, for two electrons and finding the specific eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\n### 1. Define the System and the States\n\n*   **Individual Electrons:** The two electrons are in a *p* orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   **Individual Magnetic Quantum Numbers ($m_l$):** For an electron with $l=1$, the possible magnetic quantum numbers ($m_l$) are -1, 0, and +1. These correspond to the eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator, which are $m_l\\hbar$.\n*   **Initial Coupled State:** The two-electron system is in a specific coupled state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number.\n*   **Measurement Outcome State:** We want to find the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the first electron in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron in the state with $m_2 = -1$. This uncoupled product state is written as $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. The Principle of Angular Momentum Conservation\n\nA fundamental principle in the coupling of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. The total magnetic quantum number, $m$, of a coupled state must be equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$, of the uncoupled states that compose it.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n### 3. Applying the Principle to the Problem\n\n*   The initial state of the system has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the conservation principle:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (-2) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system's state (-1), this outcome is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n### 4. Conclusion from Quantum Theory\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular outcome is found by projecting the initial state onto the desired final state. The probability is the square of the magnitude of this projection. The coefficients for this projection are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe probability P is given by:\n$P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n\nIn this case, since $-1 + (-1) \\neq -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. Therefore, the amplitude for this transition is zero, and the probability is also zero.\n\nThere is a zero probability of jointly measuring the z-component of angular momentum for the two electrons to be $-\\hbar$ each, because such an outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
