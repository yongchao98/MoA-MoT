    "The experiment described traces the path of a viral antigen administered orally. The antigen reaches the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. Here, they stimulate a population of cells to proliferate. Sequencing reveals that the variable heavy chain genes of these proliferating cells exhibit high variability. This points to a specific process of antibody diversification.\n\nHere is an analysis of the options:\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process where gene segments (Variable, Diversity, and Joining) are rearranged to form the initial antigen receptor. This occurs in the bone marrow during the early development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario described is an ongoing immune response to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, not initial B cell development.\n\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in B cells that have been activated by an antigen. This happens in germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, and is responsible for \"fine-tuning\" the antibody's affinity for the antigen. The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the definition of somatic hypermutation.\n\n*   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, which alters the antibody's effector function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA). However, CSR does not change the variable region of the heavy chain, so it does not affect antigen specificity or account for the observed variability in that region.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a system of proteins in the blood that enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells. It is a component of the humoral immune system but is not a process of genetic modification within B cells and does not create genetic variability.\n\nThe key observation is the generation of *new* variability in the *variable* region of the heavy chain gene within a proliferating cell population located in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen challenge. This is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
