    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a specific vector field within a sphere. The vector field, denoted as f(r), has a magnitude that decreases as the square of the distance from the origin (1/r²) and points radially outward. The volume for the integration is a sphere of radius R, also centered at the origin.\n\nThe integral to be calculated is:\n∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV\n\nWhere:\n*   **f(r)** is the vector field, given by f(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n*   **∇ ⋅ f** is the divergence of the vector field **f**.\n*   **V** is the volume of the sphere with radius R.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates for r > 0 yields zero. However, the vector field is undefined at the origin (r=0), creating a singularity. This singularity means a straightforward calculation of the divergence being zero everywhere is misleading. The presence of this singularity at the origin, which is contained within the volume of integration, is crucial.\n\nThe most appropriate method to solve this problem is to use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem is expressed as:\n\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\n\nHere, **S** represents the surface of the sphere of radius R, and **dS** is the differential surface area vector, which points outward and normal to the surface.\n\nTo solve the integral using the Divergence Theorem:\n1.  **Define the vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is equal to `R`. So, the vector field **f** on the surface is **f(R)** = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **Define the differential surface area vector:** For a sphere, the outward normal vector is in the radial direction (**r̂**). The magnitude of the differential surface area in spherical coordinates is R² sin(θ) dθ dφ. Therefore, **dS** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n3.  **Calculate the dot product f ⋅ dS:**\n    **f ⋅ dS** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\n    The dot product of the unit vector **r̂** with itself is 1. The R² terms cancel out.\n    **f ⋅ dS** = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n4.  **Integrate over the surface of the sphere:** The limits of integration for the polar angle θ are 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are 0 to 2π.\n    ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ\n5.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    *   The integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   The integral of the result (2) with respect to φ from 0 to 2π is ∫[0 to 2π] 2 dφ = [2φ] from 0 to 2π = 4π.\n\nThe result of the surface integral, and therefore the volume integral of the divergence, is 4π. This result is independent of the radius R of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin. The divergence of this particular vector field is more formally described by the Dirac delta function, where ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ(**r**), and the integral of this over a volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
