    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of each acid and base and then determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles:**\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions (OH-) per formula unit, the moles of OH- are: 0.090 moles Ba(OH)2 × 2 = 0.180 moles OH-.\n\n**2. Neutralization Reactions:**\nThe neutralization process occurs in steps, with the strong acid and strong base reacting first.\n\n*   **Strong Acid vs. Strong Base:**\n    *   Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.080 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.180 moles\n    *   The strong base is in excess. After neutralization, the moles of OH- remaining are:\n        *   0.180 moles OH- - 0.080 moles H+ = 0.100 moles OH-\n\n*   **Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid:**\n    *   The 0.100 moles of excess OH- will now react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n    *   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH available = 0.050 moles\n    *   The strong base is still in excess. It will completely neutralize the weak acid.\n        *   0.100 moles OH- - 0.050 moles CH3COOH = **0.050 moles OH- in final excess**\n\n**3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of a strong base (OH-). The presence of this strong base will be the determining factor for the pH.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n    *   500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Concentration of excess OH- ions:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.050 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
