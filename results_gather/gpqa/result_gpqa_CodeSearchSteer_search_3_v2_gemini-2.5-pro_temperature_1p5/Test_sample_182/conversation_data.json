    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction and identify the structure of the final product.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Reactant and Reagents**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n    *   Cyclohexene ring: C₆\n    *   Carboxylic acid group (-COOH): C₁O₂\n    *   Formyl group (-CHO): C₁O₁\n    *   Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂): C₂\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens (H). The parent structure is a cyclohexene. Adding the substituents: C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### **2. The Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This reagent is known to carry out the complete reduction of several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, it reduces:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) and ketones to alkanes (CH₂ or CH₃).\n*   Alcohols (-OH) to alkanes.\n*   Alkenes (C=C) and alkynes to saturated alkanes.\n\nTherefore, all the functional groups in the starting material (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and the two double bonds) will be fully reduced to their saturated forms. The oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n### **3. Determining the Product**\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting molecule into a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   The C₁₀ carbon skeleton will remain.\n*   The cyclohexene ring will become a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group will be reduced to an ethyl group.\n\nThe product will be a disubstituted cyclohexane with one ethyl and two methyl groups. Since all double bonds are gone and all oxygens are removed, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated from the molecular formula using the following equation:\n\n**IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1**\n\nWhere:\n*   C = number of carbon atoms\n*   H = number of hydrogen atoms\n*   N = number of nitrogen atoms\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD represents the sum of rings and π-bonds in a molecule. The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which has one ring and zero π-bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
