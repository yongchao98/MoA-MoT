    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral centers and lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere's an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule itself is planar, which means it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with designated chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a specific designation indicates that it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Due to its complex, bridged structure, it lacks internal symmetry and is therefore **optically active**.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and, despite having chiral centers, are optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. It has two chiral centers and lacks an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image, the (2S, 3S) isomer, is non-superimposable. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The '(R)' in the name designates a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image and is thus **optically active**.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has three stereocenters. However, the 'cis' arrangement (all hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring) gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
