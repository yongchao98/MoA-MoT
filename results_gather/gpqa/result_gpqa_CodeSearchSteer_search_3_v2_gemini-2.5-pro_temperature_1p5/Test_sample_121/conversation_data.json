    "### Step-by-step Derivations of Products\n\n1.  **Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine/acetic anhydride is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. It results in the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n    *   **Product 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and replaces the bromine atom via an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).**\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a classic cyclization reaction related to the malonic ester synthesis.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) removes a proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, which is highly acidic. This forms a carbanion: [NCCHCOOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an alkylation step.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the same carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This creates a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe structure of the final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged structure with a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct proton environments is determined as follows:\n\n*   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    1.  The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH₂**CH₃) are chemically equivalent due to fast rotation around the single bonds. They will appear as one signal.\n    2.  The three protons of the methyl group (-OCH₂**CH₃**) are equivalent and will appear as a second, distinct signal.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    Due to the plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the carbons on one side of the plane are equivalent to those on the other (C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5). However, on each of these carbons, the axial and equatorial protons are in different chemical environments (they are diastereotopic) and are therefore chemically distinct.\n    3.  **C2 & C6 axial protons:** The two axial protons at these positions are equivalent to each other. This is one signal.\n    4.  **C2 & C6 equatorial protons:** The two equatorial protons at these positions are equivalent to each other but different from the axial ones. This is a second signal from the C2/C6 positions.\n    5.  **C3 & C5 axial protons:** The two axial protons here are equivalent. This is a third signal.\n    6.  **C7 & C5 equatorial protons:** The two equatorial protons here are equivalent. This is a fourth signal.\n    7.  **C4 axial proton:** This proton is unique as it lies on the symmetry plane.\n    8.  **C4 equatorial proton:** This proton is also on the symmetry plane but is diastereotopic to the C4 axial proton and is therefore distinct.\n\n**Counting the Signals:**\n*   2 signals from the ethyl group.\n*   6 signals from the cyclohexane ring (C2/6-ax, C2/6-eq, C3/5-ax, C3/5-eq, C4-ax, C4-eq).\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
