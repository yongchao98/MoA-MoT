    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we must first calculate its lifetime in its own rest frame and then account for the relativistic effects of time dilation and length contraction due to its high velocity in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the particle.** The lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width (Γ) and is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n    *   Given Γ = 320 MeV\n    *   τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).** This factor describes the time dilation and is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n    *   Given E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n    *   Given m_X = 1.2 GeV, which means its rest mass energy is mc² = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n    *   γ = E / mc² = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\n3.  **Calculate the particle's velocity relative to the speed of light (β).** This can be derived from the Lorentz factor using the relation β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n    *   β = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d).** In the laboratory frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the factor γ. The distance it travels is its velocity (v = βc) multiplied by its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula for the mean decay distance is d = γβcτ.\n    *   d = (20/3) * √(391/400) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 6.667 * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAn alternative and equivalent calculation uses the relativistic momentum (p). The mean decay length can also be expressed as d = (pc/mc²) * cτ.\n\n*   First, find the momentum: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n    *   (8000 MeV)² = (pc)² + (1200 MeV)²\n    *   (pc)² = 64,000,000 - 1,440,000 = 62,560,000 MeV²\n    *   pc = √62,560,000 ≈ 7909.5 MeV\n*   Then calculate the decay distance:\n    *   d = (7909.5 MeV / 1200 MeV) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 6.591 * (6.171 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n    *   d ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
