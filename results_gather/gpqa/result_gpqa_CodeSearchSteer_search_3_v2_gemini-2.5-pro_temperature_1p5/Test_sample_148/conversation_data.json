    "The observations provided are highly characteristic of a specific chemical phenomenon. Let's analyze the evidence step-by-step:\n\n*   **NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which have similar chemical shifts and a combined integral of one proton, indicates that the proton exists in two slightly different chemical environments. Since these two species are in roughly equal amounts (equal integrals), and spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this suggests the presence of two very similar compounds.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The observation of two separate peaks of equal intensity in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms the presence of two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties. The fact that both peaks give the *same* mass spectrum, which matches the expected product, proves that these two compounds are isomersâ€”they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different spatial arrangements of atoms.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single peak in the NMR and a single peak in the LC. This contradicts the observations.\n*   **B) Contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule with a different mass. The MS data, showing both LC peaks have a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule, rules out this possibility.\n*   **D) 'Double coupling':** This is not a standard chemical term. If it were to mean a side reaction creating a new adduct (like acylation of the amine twice), it would result in a product with a different mass, which is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n*   **C) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Crucially, they have different physical properties and are chemically distinct. This means they will have different NMR spectra and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. In peptide synthesis, a common side reaction is the racemization of an amino acid's alpha-carbon during the coupling step. If the peptide being synthesized already contains one or more chiral centers, racemization of another chiral center will create a diastereomer. For example, coupling an L-amino acid to another L-amino acid (to make an L-L peptide) might involve some racemization of the second amino acid to its D-form, resulting in a mixture of L-L and L-D peptides. These two products are diastereomers. They have the same mass but different 3D structures, leading to separate peaks in both NMR and LC analyses, which perfectly explains all the observations.\n\nTherefore, the presence of two separable isomers of the same mass, with distinct NMR signals for corresponding protons, is a classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture formed during synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
