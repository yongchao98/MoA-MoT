    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\nThe user has requested the major products for two separate chemical reactions. Both are examples of the Michael addition reaction.\n\n#### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a base-catalyzed Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6, leading to a single possible enolate structure where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The enolate, with its nucleophilic character at C6, attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation during workup, the added group is `–CH2CH2COOEt`.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The final product, **A**, is a cyclohexanone ring with the original substituents (ethyl and methyl at C2, methyl at C6) and the new ethyl propanoate group also at C6. The structure can be named as ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, although this involves an unconventional numbering of the cyclohexyl ring. Based on this analysis, options C and D are incorrect.\n\n#### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is another Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion acts as the Michael donor (nucleophile). The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n2.  **Nucleophile and Electrophile**:\n    *   The nucleophile is the anion of 1-nitropropane: `CH3CH2CH(NO2)⁻`.\n    *   The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile: `CH3CH=CHCN`. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The resulting product has the structure `CH3CH2CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)CH2CN`. To name this compound (**B**), we find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon from the nitrile (CN) group.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile: `CN(1)–CH2(2)–CH(CH3)(3)–CH(NO2)(4)–CH2(5)–CH3(6)`.\n    *   This is a six-carbon chain, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is correctly identified as **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is correctly identified as **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
