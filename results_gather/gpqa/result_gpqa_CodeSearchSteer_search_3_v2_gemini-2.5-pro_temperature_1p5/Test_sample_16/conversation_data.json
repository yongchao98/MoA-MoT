    "The search results confirm my initial approach.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the problem:\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex into calcium ions and EDTA ions.\n    Ca-EDTA <=> Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA = 0.02 M\n    *   Formation constant (K_f) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Define the equilibrium expression:** The formation constant, K_f, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.\n    K_f = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n4.  **Set up an equilibrium table (ICE table):** Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n    *   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n    Because the formation constant is very large (K_f >> 1), the complex is very stable, and the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can simplify the equation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearrange to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe problem mentions an \"ideal pH\". The stability of the metal-EDTA complex is pH-dependent. The given formation constant K_f uses the concentration of the fully deprotonated EDTA⁴⁻. An \"ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough (typically pH > 10) for almost all free EDTA to be in the Y⁴⁻ form, so we can use the given K_f value directly without needing a conditional constant (K'_f).\n\n<<<D>>>"
