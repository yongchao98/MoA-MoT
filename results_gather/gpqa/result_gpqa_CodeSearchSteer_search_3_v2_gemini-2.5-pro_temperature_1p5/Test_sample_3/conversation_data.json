    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles, two of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism would be altered to account for them.\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that there are no isolated magnetic north or south poles; they always come in pairs. If magnetic monopoles (or \"magnetic charges\") existed, this law would have to be modified so that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge, just as the divergence of the electric field is proportional to electric charge.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction**: This law relates a changing magnetic field to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field (∇xE). The existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the existence of \"magnetic currents\"—the flow of these magnetic charges. To make Maxwell's equations symmetric for both electric and magnetic charges, a magnetic current term would need to be added to Faraday's Law. This means a magnetic current would be a source for a circulating electric field, just as an electric current is a source for a circulating magnetic field in the Ampère-Maxwell law.\n\nTherefore, the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<D>>>"
