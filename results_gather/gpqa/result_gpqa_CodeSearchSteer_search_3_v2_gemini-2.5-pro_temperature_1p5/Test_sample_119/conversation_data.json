    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself, under the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution means that the number of stars per unit volume (the stellar density, ρ) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell:** Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on the observer. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the stellar density (ρ) multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** To find how the number of stars changes with parallax, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   We already have `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1 / plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = - (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   Since we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that distance decreases as parallax increases). We take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see this relationship:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
