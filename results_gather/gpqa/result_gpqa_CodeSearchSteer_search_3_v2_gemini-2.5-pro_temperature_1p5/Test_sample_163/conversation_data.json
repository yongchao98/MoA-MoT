    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to double-lined spectroscopic binaries.\n\n### Analysis of the Systems\nFor a binary star system where both sets of spectral lines are visible (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\n\nM_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for each star.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\nA critical piece of information given is that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be aligned with our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°. In this case, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\nThe simplified relationship, ignoring the constant term 2πG which will cancel out in the ratio, is:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### Calculation for Each System\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K₁_₁ and K₁_₂) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes (K₂_₁ and K₂_₂) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n### Mass Ratio Calculation\nWe can now find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2:\n\nRatio = M_system1 / M_system2 = [P₁ * (K₁_₁ + K₁_₂)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_₁ + K₂_₂)³]\n\nRatio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / 15625\n\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
