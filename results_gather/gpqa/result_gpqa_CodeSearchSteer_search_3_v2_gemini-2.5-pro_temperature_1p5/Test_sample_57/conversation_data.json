    "In the realm of theoretical physics, regularization is a crucial technique used to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly those associated with high energies or, equivalently, short distances. These infinities, known as ultraviolet divergences, signal a breakdown of the theory at those scales. The need for regularization is a common feature of quantum field theories.\n\n**A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD describes the interactions of quarks and gluons. Like other quantum field theories, calculations in QCD involving loop diagrams lead to ultraviolet divergences. To obtain finite and physically meaningful predictions, these divergences must be tamed through a process of regularization and renormalization. Common methods include lattice regularization and dimensional regularization. Therefore, QCD requires regularization at high energies.\n\n**B) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum theory, classical electrodynamics faces its own high-energy problem when dealing with point-like charged particles. The self-energy of a point charge, which is the energy of the particle's own electromagnetic field, is infinite. This singularity requires a form of regularization to make the theory consistent.\n\n**C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of the electromagnetic force. It was in the development of QED that the problem of infinities in quantum field theory first became a major obstacle. Calculations of physical quantities, such as the self-energy of the electron, result in divergent integrals that necessitate the use of regularization and subsequent renormalization to match experimental observations. Thus, QED fundamentally requires regularization for high-energy phenomena.\n\n**D) Superstring Theory:** A significant departure from point-particle theories, superstring theory posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are one-dimensional strings rather than zero-dimensional points. This fundamental difference has profound implications for high-energy behavior. The extended nature of strings smooths out the interactions at very short distances, which is the source of ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theories. Consequently, a key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free of these ultraviolet divergences. While regularization techniques might be employed as mathematical tools in some string theory calculations, the theory itself is thought to be ultraviolet finite, meaning it does not inherently require regularization to cure high-energy infinities.\n\nBased on this, Superstring Theory is the physical theory among the choices that is thought to not require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
