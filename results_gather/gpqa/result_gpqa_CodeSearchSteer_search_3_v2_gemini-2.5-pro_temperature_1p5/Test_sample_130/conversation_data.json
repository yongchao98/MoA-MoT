    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction sequence and the interpretation of NMR spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the products.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants\n\n1.  **The Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, indicating two distinct types of carbon atoms.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**.\n    *   Let's check if the NMR data match maleic anhydride:\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has two protons on the double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these protons are equivalent and appear as a single peak. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** The molecule has two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C). This leads to two signals. The signal at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons, and the signal at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinylic carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is indeed maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n### Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), which matches the information given.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo adduct** is typically the major product formed under kinetic control, which is common for Diels-Alder reactions.\n    *   The **exo adduct** is the more stable thermodynamic product and is typically the minor product.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n\n*   A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Å apart).\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent in the minor product. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* adduct but not in the *exo* adduct.\n\n### Step 4: Structural Analysis of the *Endo* and *Exo* Adducts\n\nLet's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure:\n*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from maleic anhydride. They are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal, along with its coupling partner (not explicitly described as a distinct option), corresponds to the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge. Let's call them **H_bridge**.\n\nNow, let's examine the 3D structures:\n\n*   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C=C bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons (at ~3.5 ppm) point towards the CH₂ bridge. This brings them very close to the *syn*-proton of the CH₂ bridge (one of the protons resonating around ~1.5 ppm).\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C=C bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons point toward the C=C double bond, bringing them close to the **Me_vinyl** groups (at ~1.7 ppm). They are far from the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that is unique to the **major (*endo*) product** must be due to the spatial proximity between the **H_anhydride** protons and one of the **H_bridge** protons. Based on the provided chemical shifts, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\nThis matches option C. The interaction described in option D (between the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) would be expected in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n\nThe correct choice is therefore the one that describes the NOE correlation between the protons on the anhydride part of the molecule and the protons on the CH₂ bridge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
