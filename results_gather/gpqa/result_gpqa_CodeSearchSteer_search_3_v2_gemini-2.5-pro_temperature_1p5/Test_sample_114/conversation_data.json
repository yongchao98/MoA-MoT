    "To determine the angle between the two photons produced in the electron-positron annihilation, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. The energy `E` and momentum `p` of a particle with rest mass `m` and Lorentz factor `γ` are given by the equations:\n\n*   `E = γmc²`\n*   `p = βγmc`, where `β = v/c` and `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)`\n\nThe energy and momentum can also be related by `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n\nLet `m_e` be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron.\n\n**1. Initial State (Before Collision):**\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Energy, `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_e`: We find `p_e*c = sqrt(E_e² - (m_e*c²)²) = sqrt((4*m_e*c²)² - (m_e*c²)²) = sqrt(15)*m_e*c²`. So, `p_e = sqrt(15)*m_e*c`. It moves from the left, so its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Energy, `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_p`: We find `p_p*c = sqrt(E_p² - (m_e*c²)²) = sqrt((2*m_e*c²)² - (m_e*c²)²) = sqrt(3)*m_e*c²`. So, `p_p = sqrt(3)*m_e*c`. It moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n\nThe total initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies:\n`E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = 6*m_e*c²`.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. Since their energies are equal, let's call the energy of each photon `E_γ`. The final total energy is:\n`E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2*E_γ`.\n\nBy conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n`6*m_e*c² = 2*E_γ`\n`E_γ = 3*m_e*c²`.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\n\nMomentum is a vector quantity and must be conserved in all directions.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum:**\n    *   The total momentum is along the horizontal (x-axis).\n    *   `p_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y-axis) is zero.\n\n*   **Final Momentum:**\n    *   The two photons have equal energies, so they must have equal magnitudes of momentum. For a photon, `p = E/c`.\n    *   `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3*m_e*c²) / c = 3*m_e*c`.\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". For the vertical (y) components of their momenta to cancel out and conserve the initial zero momentum in that direction, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite. Let these angles be `θ` and `-θ`.\n\nThe final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta:\n`p_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n\nBy conservation of momentum, `p_initial_x = p_final_x`:\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3*m_e*c) * cos(θ)`\n`(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n\nWe can solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n**4. Calculation of the Angle:**\n\nUsing the approximate values `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873` and `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`:\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the total angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This angle is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\nAngle = `2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°`.\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
