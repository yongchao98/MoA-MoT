    "### Equivalent Planetary Radius for a Spotted Star\n\nTo determine the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the described starspots, a multi-step calculation is required. The process involves quantifying the brightness drop caused by the starspots and then equating this to the dimming effect of a planetary transit.\n\n**1. Calculating the Light Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its spotted and unspotted hemispheres. The maximum observed flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, while the minimum flux is seen when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nThe flux from a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). The unspotted photosphere has a temperature of 6000K, and the dark spots have a temperature of 5000K (a 1000K difference).\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve variation due to the spots is calculated based on the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. When the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, 20% of the visible disk is covered by the cooler spots. This leads to a decrease in the total light emitted. The formula for this amplitude is:\n\nAmplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nWhere:\n*   `f` is the filling factor of the spots (0.20)\n*   `T_spot` is the temperature of the spots (5000K)\n*   `T_eff` is the effective temperature of the star (6000K)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.482)\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.1035\n\nThis means the star's brightness varies by about 10.35% due to the rotating spotted surface.\n\n**2. Calculating the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius**\n\nThe dimming event caused by a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is approximately equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This can be expressed as:\n\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWhere:\n*   `R_pl` is the radius of the planet.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n\nTo find the exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the starspots, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude of the spot-induced variation:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035\n\nSolving for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\nR_pl / R_star = √0.1035\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nTherefore, a hypothetical exoplanet with a radius of approximately 0.32 times the radius of its host star would produce a transit signal with an amplitude equivalent to the brightness variations caused by the described starspots.\n\n<<<C>>>"
