    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the relation $t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c} = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge *q* at the retarded time, and *d* is the distance from this retarded position to the observation point.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following formulas:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAnd the vector potential A is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nIn these expressions:\n*   *q* is the charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n*   $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   *c* is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nTo match these standard forms to the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by *c*:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese resulting expressions match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
