    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the options to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet is, by definition, a model of Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a lower mass results in less gravitational compression. Therefore, this planet would be less dense than Earth. For example, Mars has about 11% of Earth's mass and a lower density of about 3.93 g/cm³. Venus, with about 81.5% of Earth's mass, has a density of 5.24 g/cm³, also less than Earth's. Thus, the density of this planet will be less than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For rocky planets of the same composition, increasing the mass leads to greater gravitational compression, which in turn increases the planet's average density. As mass increases, the radius also increases, but not quickly enough to offset the mass increase, leading to a higher density. Models predict that a rocky planet with 5 Earth masses would have a significantly higher density than Earth. For instance, the exoplanet K2-38b, which has a mass of about 7.3 times that of Earth, is thought to have a very high density of around 11.0 g/cm³. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition will be considerably denser than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (c): Density > 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (d): Density < 5.5 g/cm³\n\nThe planet with 5 Earth masses (c) will have the highest density due to the significant gravitational compression of its materials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
