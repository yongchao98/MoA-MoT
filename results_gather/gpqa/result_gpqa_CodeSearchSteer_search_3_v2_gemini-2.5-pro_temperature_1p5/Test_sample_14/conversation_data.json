    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we can compare their individual transit probabilities.\n\n### 1. Understanding Transit Probability\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis, especially for circular orbits. The formula is:\n\n*   **P_transit = R_s / a**\n\nWhere:\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the host star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 (Prob_1) and Planet_2 (Prob_2).\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratio\n\nThe ratio of the probabilities is:\n\n*   **Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)**\n\nAccording to the provided information, both host stars have the same radii (`R_s1 = R_s2`). Therefore, the stellar radii cancel out, and the ratio simplifies to:\n\n*   **Ratio = a2 / a1**\n\nTo find this ratio, we need to determine the semi-major axis for each planet.\n\n### 3. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`) and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). For a planet with a mass much smaller than its star, the law can be written as:\n\n*   **P² ∝ a³ / M_s**\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n*   **a³ ∝ P² * M_s**\n*   **a ∝ (P² * M_s)¹ᐟ³**\n\nThis relationship allows us to compare the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\n\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's law, the ratio `a2 / a1` is:\n\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ (P₂² * M_s2) / (P₁² * M_s1) ]¹ᐟ³**\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P₁ = P₂ / 3`, which means `P₂ / P₁ = 3`.\n*   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, which means `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ (P₂/P₁)² * (M_s2/M_s1) ]¹ᐟ³**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ (3)² * (1/2) ]¹ᐟ³**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ 9 * 0.5 ]¹ᐟ³**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ 4.5 ]¹ᐟ³**\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n\n*   **a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the ratio of the transit probabilities `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is equal to `a2 / a1`, we find that:\n\n*   **Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65**\n\nThis means that Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
