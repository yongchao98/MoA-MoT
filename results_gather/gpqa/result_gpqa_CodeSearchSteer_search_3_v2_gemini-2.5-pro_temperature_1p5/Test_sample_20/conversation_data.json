    "### Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where isomers interconvert through the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. Keto-enol tautomerism is a frequent type, requiring a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen).\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)** does not have any α-hydrogens. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Therefore, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. While tautomerism could theoretically be drawn, the resulting structure with cumulative double bonds in a six-membered ring would be extremely unstable.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** possesses α-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. The presence of these hydrogens allows it to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common cause of chirality is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (also called methyl lactate) has a central carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes it a chiral molecule that exists as optical isomers (enantiomers).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate** is the trans-isomer of butenedioic acid methyl ester. Due to the double bond, there is no chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive. Dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate are geometric isomers (diastereomers) of each other, not enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
