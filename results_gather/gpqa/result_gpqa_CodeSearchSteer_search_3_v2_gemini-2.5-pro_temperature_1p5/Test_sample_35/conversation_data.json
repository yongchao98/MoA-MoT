    "### Analysis Points to Cold Atomic Hydrogen\n\nThe observed absorption line, with a detected energy of 3.9 micro-electronvolts (3.9 µeV) from a structure 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) away, corresponds to the 21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen originating from the cold atomic interstellar medium in the Milky Way.\n\nThe identification process involves two main steps: first, determining the cosmological redshift of the source to find the absorption line's original energy, and second, matching this energy to a known transition in the interstellar medium (ISM).\n\n**1. Redshift and Rest-Frame Energy:**\n\nAn object at a comoving distance of approximately 2.1 Gpc has a significant cosmological redshift (`z`). Using standard cosmological models (ΛCDM with H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc), this distance corresponds to a redshift of about `z` = 0.5. The relationship between the observed energy (E_obs) and the rest-frame energy (E_rest) is given by `E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)`.\n\nApplying this to the observed energy:\n`E_rest = 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.5) = 5.85 µeV`\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy is approximately 5.85 micro-electronvolts.\n\n**2. Identifying the Spectral Line:**\n\nThis energy value is remarkably close to the well-known energy of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (H I), which is about 5.874 µeV. This transition, known as the 21-cm line (or 1420 MHz line), occurs when the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton in a neutral hydrogen atom. This line is one of the most important tools for studying the interstellar medium.\n\n**3. Locating the Source in the Interstellar Medium:**\n\nNeutral atomic hydrogen in the ISM exists in different temperature phases. Absorption lines, like the one observed, are typically formed when there is colder gas in front of a warmer background source. The 21-cm absorption is specifically a tracer of the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), which has typical temperatures of 10-100 K. The warm atomic phase of the ISM is generally too diffuse and kinetically hot to produce significant absorption features.\n\nTherefore, an absorption line with this rest-frame energy is a characteristic signature of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
