    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Observations**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃) and change the mass of the tube. Since the weight did not change, no significant amount of acidic gas like CO₂ was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   Hot copper can also react with nitrogen oxides. For example, nitrous oxide (N₂O) reacts to form nitrogen gas and copper oxide (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO). This possibility must be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas did not react with the drying agent, limewater, or hot copper. The most common inert gas in such decompositions is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Products of Decomposition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gaseous products from heating salts A and B are:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Composition and Moles of the Initial Salts**\n\nThe products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, which must have come from the initial salts. This points towards ammonium salts of oxyacids of nitrogen. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe decomposition reactions for these salts are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition is temperature-dependent. At around 200°C, the main reaction produces nitrous oxide: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g). However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, a different reaction can occur: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nLet's assume the mixture is equimolar, with `n` moles of each salt. Let's calculate `n` from the total mass.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = `n * (64.04) + n * (80.04) = 7.20` g\n*   `n * (144.08) = 7.20`\n*   `n = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05` mol\n\nSo, we have **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂** and **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**. Now let's see if their decomposition products match the experimental results.\n\n*   **Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Using NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: **0.05 mol N₂** and **0.10 mol H₂O**.\n\n*   **Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Let's test the reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃, the moles of products are:\n        *   N₂: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (2 mol N₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.05 mol N₂**\n        *   O₂: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.025 mol O₂**\n        *   H₂O: (0.05 mol NH₄NO₃) * (4 mol H₂O / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = **0.10 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Total products from the mixture:**\n    *   Total Moles H₂O = 0.10 (from nitrite) + 0.10 (from nitrate) = **0.20 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n    *   Total Moles O₂ = 0 (from nitrite) + 0.025 (from nitrate) = **0.025 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n    *   Total Moles N₂ = 0.05 (from nitrite) + 0.05 (from nitrate) = **0.10 mol**. (Matches experiment)\n\nThe hypothesis that the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate, with the given decomposition pathways, perfectly matches all the experimental data.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts:**\n    *   Total = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
