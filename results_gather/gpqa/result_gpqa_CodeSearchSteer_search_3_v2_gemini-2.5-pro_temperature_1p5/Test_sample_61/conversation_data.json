    "The synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane involves a multi-step process. The final product is an aldol addition product, specifically the result of the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Therefore, the core of the synthesis is to first prepare cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane and then induce the aldol reaction.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Alkylation of the terminal alkyne**: The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C₈H₁₂). It has a terminal alkyne, which means it has an acidic proton that can be removed by a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂). The resulting acetylide ion can then react with an alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride (CH₃Cl), in an alkylation reaction. This step adds a methyl group to the alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into 1-cyclohexylpropyne (C₉H₁₄).\n    *   *Reaction: Cyclohexyl-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺*\n    *   *Followed by: Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃*\n\n2.  **Partial reduction to a *cis*-alkene**: The internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexylpropyne, needs to be converted into an alkene for the next step. A complete reduction to an alkane would not be productive. Using a poisoned catalyst, specifically Lindlar's catalyst (H₂/Pd-CaCO₃), the alkyne is selectively reduced to a *cis*-alkene. This reaction, known as a syn-addition, yields (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene.\n    *   *Reaction: Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂ (with Lindlar's catalyst) → cis-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃*\n\n3.  **Ozonolysis with reductive workup**: The alkene is then cleaved to produce the desired aldehyde. Ozonolysis (O₃) followed by a reductive workup using dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S) cleaves the double bond and yields two carbonyl compounds. Cleavage of (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene produces cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   *Reaction: cis-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃ + O₃; then (CH₃)₂S → Cyclohexyl-CHO + CH₃CHO*\n\n4.  **Base-catalyzed aldol addition**: The final step is to form the target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This is achieved through a base-catalyzed aldol addition. A base such as barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product. While aldol reactions involving cyclohexanecarbaldehyde as the nucleophile can be difficult due to steric hindrance, they are known to occur.\n    *   *Reaction: 2 x Cyclohexyl-CHO (with Ba(OH)₂) → 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde*\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct sequence of reagents corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
