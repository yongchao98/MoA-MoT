    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition for the wave function. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle in the region where it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\n**1. Probability Density:**\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\nThe wave function is given as a complex function:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nThe magnitude squared of a complex number z = u + vi is |z|² = u² + v².\nIn this case, the real part is u = a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is v = -0.5.\nTherefore, the probability density is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Normalization Integral:**\nThe problem states that the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. Thus, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be 1.\n∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solving the Integral:**\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFirst, solve the integral of the first term:\na² ∫₁³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluating this from 1 to 3 gives:\na² [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)]\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c), this simplifies to:\na² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2)\n\nNext, solve the integral of the second term:\n∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 0.25 [x] from 1 to 3 = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\nNow, substitute the results back into the normalization equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ √0.7214\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
