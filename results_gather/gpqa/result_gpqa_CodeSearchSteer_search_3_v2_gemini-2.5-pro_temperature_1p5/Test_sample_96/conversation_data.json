    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are due to a post-zygotic molecular mechanism known as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI).\n\nIn individuals with more than one X chromosome, such as females (XX) and males with Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY), a dosage compensation mechanism is activated early in embryonic development. This process largely silences all but one of the X chromosomes in each somatic cell. The silenced X chromosome is compacted into a structure called a Barr body.\n\nThis inactivation is an epigenetic process, driven by the *Xist* gene, which produces a non-coding RNA that coats the chromosome and triggers a cascade of modifications. These modifications include changes to histone proteins, such as the methylation of lysine residues on histone H3, and DNA methylation. These epigenetic marks ensure that most genes on the extra X chromosome are not transcribed, thus normalizing the dosage of X-linked genes to be similar to that of a normal male (XY).\n\nWhile X-inactivation silences most genes on the extra X chromosome, about 15% of genes \"escape\" this process and remain active. The expression of these extra gene copies contributes to the specific features of Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nIn contrast, Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of an autosome, chromosome 21. There is no equivalent large-scale inactivation mechanism for autosomes. Consequently, individuals with Trisomy 21 have three active copies of the genes on this chromosome, leading to a more significant gene dosage imbalance. This overexpression of hundreds of genes results in the more severe and wide-ranging phenotypic effects characteristic of Down's syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the molecular mechanism responsible for the milder phenotype in Klinefelter's syndrome is the epigenetic silencing of the extra X chromosome via chromatin modifications, including histone methylation.\n\n*   **A) Chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis:** This is a meiotic process; errors here can cause nondisjunction but do not explain the difference in severity *after* fertilization.\n*   **B) Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote:** This accurately describes a key component of X-chromosome inactivation, the epigenetic mechanism that provides dosage compensation in XXY individuals.\n*   **C) Attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I:** Like option A, this is a potential cause of the initial nondisjunction event, not the reason for differing phenotypic severity between the two syndromes.\n*   **D) Progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst:** This relates to general DNA replication, not the specific gene dosage compensation that differentiates sex chromosome aneuploidies from autosomal ones.\n\n<<<B>>>"
