    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\nThe problem describes a two-step sequence known as **anti-dihydroxylation**, where an alkene is first converted to an epoxide, which is then opened by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The stereochemical outcome of this sequence depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. This process stereospecifically converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition; the incoming water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The anti-addition to a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides results in the formation of a single, achiral *meso* compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene stereospecifically produces a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane is formed. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the *meso*-epoxide leads to a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Attack on the two carbons of the epoxide ring results in the formation of both (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol in equal amounts.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**1. Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase. In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point) and can be separated by standard chromatography.\n*   Therefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will have a different retention time and will appear as a separate peak.\n*   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The chiral stationary phase forms transient, diastereomeric complexes with each enantiomer, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times.\n*   Diastereomers are also readily separated on a chiral column.\n*   Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved: the meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer will each produce a distinct peak.\n*   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
