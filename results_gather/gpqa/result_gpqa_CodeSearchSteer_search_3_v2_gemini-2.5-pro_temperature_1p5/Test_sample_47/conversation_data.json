    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.**\n    This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom attaches to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n    When an α-halo ketone with an available acidic proton on the opposite side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup, which is implied). The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n    Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is often used as a solvent and to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H).**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-aldehyde):** This proton is bonded to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton (methine) is on the carbon where the aldehyde group is attached. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, the other is *trans*). The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. The proton closer to the aldehyde group is equivalent to its counterpart on C4, and the proton farther away is equivalent to its counterpart on C4. This results in two more distinct sets of protons.\n\nIn summary, there are six sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n*   Signal 1: Aldehydic H (1H)\n*   Signal 2: C1 methine H (1H)\n*   Signal 3: C2/C5 methylene H's (2H, one type)\n*   Signal 4: C2/C5 methylene H's (2H, second type)\n*   Signal 5: C3/C4 methylene H's (2H, one type)\n*   Signal 6: C3/C4 methylene H's (2H, second type)\n\nTherefore, there are **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
