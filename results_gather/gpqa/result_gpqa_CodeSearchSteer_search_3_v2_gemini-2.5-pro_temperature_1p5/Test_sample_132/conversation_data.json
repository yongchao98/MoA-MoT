    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n### 1. Understand the Chemical System\n\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n*   **KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻** (provides the weak acid, dihydrogen phosphate)\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O** (provides the conjugate base, hydrogen phosphate)\n\nThis mixture forms a buffer solution governed by the equilibria of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄). The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is the final product of the complete deprotonation of phosphoric acid.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of the Acid and Conjugate Base\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) from the given masses.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n### 3. Calculate the Concentrations of the Acid and Conjugate Base\n\nNext, we find the initial concentrations of these ions in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume (L)\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume (L)\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 4. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe pH (and thus the [H⁺]) of the buffer is primarily controlled by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange the acid dissociation constant expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nWe rearrange the expression for Ka₃ to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   **[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])**\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
