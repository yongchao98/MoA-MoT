    "The search results confirm my physical understanding and the formulas I've used.\n\n1.  **Mean decay length in the lab frame ($L_{lab}$):** The average distance a relativistic particle travels before decaying. It's calculated by taking the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), dilating it by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$), and multiplying by the particle's velocity ($v$).\n    *   $L_{lab} = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   Since $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta = v/c$), this becomes $L_{lab} = \\beta c \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   This can also be expressed using momentum as $L_{lab} = \\frac{p c}{m_0 c^2} c \\tau_0$, where $p$ is the relativistic momentum and $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n\n2.  **Decay Probability:** The decay of particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ is $P(t) = e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$. Consequently, the probability of it surviving to travel a distance $L$ is $P(L) = e^{-L/L_{lab}}$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Observation:** To \"observe\" a decay in a bubble chamber, the particle's track must be long enough to be resolved. If the detector's minimum resolution is $d$, a decay is observable only if the decay length $L$ is greater than $d$.\n\n4.  **Problem's Condition:** We need to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution ($d$) must be at least 0.30.\n    *   $P(L > d) \\ge 0.30$\n    *   $e^{-d/L_{lab}} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum resolution, we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-d/L_{lab}} = 0.30 \\implies d = -L_{lab} \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nNow, I will perform the calculation based on these confirmed principles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the particle's momentum and Lorentz factor.**\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   The relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$.\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame ($L_{lab}$).**\n*   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   The formula for mean decay length is $L_{lab} = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n*   $L_{lab} = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n*   $L_{lab} = 7.853 \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n*   $L_{lab} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d$).**\n*   $d = -L_{lab} \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n*   $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nThis calculated value, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is closest to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The discrepancy of about 9% might arise from slightly different values for the physical constants used in the problem's original formulation or a rounding of the input values. However, given the choices, C is the only physically plausible answer. The other options differ by several orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<C>>>"
