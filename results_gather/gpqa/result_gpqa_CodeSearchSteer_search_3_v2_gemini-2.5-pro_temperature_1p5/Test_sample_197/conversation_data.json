    "The percentage of a specific cobalt-containing species, in this case, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex [Co(SCN)₂], can be determined by calculating its mole fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (βn), the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we can derive a formula for α₂ that depends only on the free thiocyanate concentration and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nSince the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] as being equal to the total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms for the formula:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNext, we calculate the value of the denominator (the sum of all terms):\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
