    "To solve this problem, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the given information and then predict its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **1. Molecular Structure Determination**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** The FTIR data shows the presence of a carbonyl group. This group accounts for one carbon atom.\n*   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on this, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A substituent containing one carbonyl group and the remaining carbon atom. This forms an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThe molecule is therefore a haloacetophenone. The general formula is C₈H₇XO, which fits the provided information.\n\n### **2. ¹H NMR Spectrum Prediction**\n\nNow, we need to predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. Let's consider the possible substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para) on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This group has three equivalent protons on the methyl group. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)**, integrating to **3H**. Due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl group, its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0–2.7 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The benzene ring has four protons. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution.\n    *   **Ortho-substitution:** Would result in four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n    *   **Meta-substitution:** Would also result in four distinct and complex signals.\n    *   **Para-substitution:** This pattern is highly symmetric. The four aromatic protons are present as two chemically equivalent sets. This leads to a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2H**. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are expected to be further downfield than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's compare our predictions with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). The singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group next to a carbonyl. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Again, the signals are not in the expected regions, and the integration (2H singlet) does not match a methyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a methyl ketone. The 2H singlet at 3.7 ppm is also inconsistent with an acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This signal perfectly matches the acetyl methyl group—a singlet integrating to 3H in the correct chemical shift region.\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for an aromatic ring substituted with an acetyl group and a halogen. For example, the ¹H NMR spectrum of 4-chloroacetophenone shows signals at δ 7.57 (d, 2H), 7.09 (d, 2H), and 2.28 (s, 3H). While the exact shifts vary, the pattern described in option D is characteristic and correct.\n\nTherefore, the data in option D corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
