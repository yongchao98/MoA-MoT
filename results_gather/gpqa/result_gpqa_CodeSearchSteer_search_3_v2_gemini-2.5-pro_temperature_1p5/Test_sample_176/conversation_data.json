    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. In this formula, R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars (L₁/L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, and σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n\n**2. Wien's Displacement Law:**\nWien's law states that the wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nThe problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. This means λ_max₁ = λ_max₂. According to Wien's law, if the peak wavelengths are identical, their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures (T₁/T₂) is 1.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nNow we can substitute the known values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The temperatures are the same, so T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe additional information about the stars' masses and radial velocities is not required for this specific calculation. Luminosity is an intrinsic property of a star and does not depend on its velocity relative to an observer.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>"
