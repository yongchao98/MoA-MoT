    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Volume of Acid\n\nFirst, we determine the amount of strong acid needed to dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The dissolution of solid Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** Based on the atomic masses (Fe ≈ 55.85, O ≈ 16.00, H ≈ 1.01), the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We can calculate the moles from the given mass:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    Moles = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Required:** From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n*   **Volume of 0.1 M Acid:** The volume of the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed is:\n    Volume = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration\n    Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n    Converting to cubic centimeters: 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis value for the volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option B.\n\n### 2. Calculate the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions. These ions, more accurately represented as the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic.\n\n*   **Hydrolysis Reaction:**\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺:** The moles of Fe³⁺ produced are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃, which is 0.0009357 mol. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\n*   **Equilibrium Calculation:** To find the pH, we use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion. The literature value for this Ka is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻³ to 6.5 x 10⁻³. We will use Ka = 6.3 x 10⁻³.\n    Ka = [[Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺] [H₃O⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n\n    Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of H₃O⁺.\n    6.3 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n    x² = 6.3 x 10⁻³ * (0.009357 - x)\n    x² = 5.895 x 10⁻⁵ - 6.3 x 10⁻³ x\n    x² + (6.3 x 10⁻³)x - 5.895 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\n*   **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n    x = [-(6.3 x 10⁻³) ± √((6.3 x 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.895 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2(1)\n    x = [-0.0063 ± √(3.969 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.358 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n    x = [-0.0063 ± √(2.755 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n    x = [-0.0063 ± 0.0166] / 2\n\n    Since concentration cannot be negative, we take the positive root:\n    x = (-0.0063 + 0.0166) / 2 = 0.0103 / 2 = 0.00515 M\n    So, [H₃O⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = -log[H₃O⁺]\n    pH = -log(0.00515) ≈ **2.29**\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 28.07 cm³ and a pH of 2.29. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   D) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nThe calculated volume (28.07 cm³) matches option B (28.05 cm³) very well. The calculated pH (2.29) is also closest to option B's pH of 2.04. Minor discrepancies can arise from using slightly different values for molar mass or the Ka constant. A Ka value of 1.0x10⁻³ (as seen in one source) would yield a pH of 2.5, closer to option C, but the volume would still point towards B. A Ka of 8.9 x 10⁻³ yields a pH of 2.15, very close to option B. Given the strong agreement in the volume calculation, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
