    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible configurations of the system. The energy E is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and each spin can be either +1 or -1.\n\nFirst, we identify all possible spin configurations and calculate the corresponding energy for each. There are 2³ = 8 possible states for the three spins.\n\nThe states can be grouped by their energy levels:\n\n**Group 1: All spins are aligned (either all up or all down).**\n*   **State (+1, +1, +1):**\n    E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State (-1, -1, -1):**\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nFor the energy level E₁ = -3J, there are 2 states. This is the degeneracy of the energy level, g₁ = 2.\n\n**Group 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n*   **Two spins are +1, one is -1:** There are three such configurations: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1). For the state (+1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n*   **One spin is +1, two are -1:** There are three such configurations: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1). For the state (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\nDue to the symmetry of the system, all 6 of these states have the same energy level E₂ = J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the contributions from all states. It is calculated by summing the degeneracies multiplied by their corresponding Boltzmann factors:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
