    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, we use the formula:\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\n\nGiven the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4) and the spin operator S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix:\nσ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nFirst, we represent the spin state as a column vector (ket):\n|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T\n\nNext, we find the corresponding bra vector, ⟨ψ|, which is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, which is part of the normalization:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (–3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = –9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nThen, we apply the S_y operator to the ket |ψ⟩:\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4)], [(i)(3i) + (0)(4)]]^T\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]^T\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T\n\nNow we calculate the full expression ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² – 12]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 – 12]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ\n\nFinally, we compute the expectation value by dividing ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.\n⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
