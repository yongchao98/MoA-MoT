    "The detailed chemical puzzle can be solved step-by-step to identify the substances involved and perform the required calculation.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K.\n*   **Identifying the Heavier Isotope:** Since B is heavy water, the heavier isotope incorporated in Substance X must be deuterium (D or ²H), which is a stable isotope of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron.\n*   **Identifying Substance X:** The clue that Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions with keto acids, points towards a powerful reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common reagent of this type. Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits the description of containing a heavy isotope.\n*   **Confirming the Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y:** The violent reaction described is consistent with the reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume liquid Y is D₂O. The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be vigorous.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas released is D₂. A molecule of D₂ contains two protons (one from each deuterium atom) and two neutrons (one from each deuterium atom), satisfying the condition that the number of protons and neutrons are equal.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** In the reaction above, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is formed as a precipitate.\n    *   **Formation of B from G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated analog) decomposes. The reaction is 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This confirms that heating precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) releases substance B (D₂O).\n\n*   **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The question requires summing the atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of Aluminum and four atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   The mass of the stable isotope of Aluminum, ²⁷Al, is approximately 26.98 amu.\n    *   The mass of the Deuterium isotope, ²H, is approximately 2.014 amu.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 × ²⁷Al) + (Mass of 4 × ²H)\n    *   Cumulative Mass ≈ 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe sum of the atomic masses is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
