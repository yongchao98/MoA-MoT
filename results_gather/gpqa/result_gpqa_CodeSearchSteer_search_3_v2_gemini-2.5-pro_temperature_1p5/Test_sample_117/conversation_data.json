    "The reaction in question is between an enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol) and bromine (Br₂). The search results confirm that the reaction of an enol with a halogen, such as bromine, is a standard method for the α-halogenation of ketones.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reaction:\n1.  **Enol as the Reactive Species**: The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Enols are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles.\n2.  **Electrophilic Attack**: The double bond of the enol attacks the electrophilic bromine molecule (Br₂). This step is similar to the first step of halogen addition to a simple alkene.\n3.  **Intermediate Formation and Tautomerization**: The attack results in the formation of an intermediate where a bromine atom is attached to the alpha-carbon (the carbon that was C2 in the enol). This intermediate is an oxonium ion.\n4.  **Final Product**: The oxonium ion is then deprotonated to regenerate the stable carbonyl group (C=O). The final product is a ketone with a bromine atom on the alpha-carbon.\n\nApplying this to the specific reactants:\n*   The enol is **4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol**.\n*   The corresponding ketone is **4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n*   The alpha-carbons in the ketone are C2 and C5, which are equivalent.\n*   The reaction will place a bromine atom at the alpha-position (C2).\n\nTherefore, the major product is **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n*   **A) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol** and **D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol**: These are products of addition, not substitution. The formation of an α-haloketone is the characteristic reaction of enols with halogens, making simple addition to form a di-bromo alcohol unlikely as the major pathway.\n*   **B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**: This is the α-bromoketone, which is the expected product.\n*   **C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**: Bromination at C4 is not feasible as it is a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens to be substituted.\n\nThe reaction is an α-substitution that proceeds through the enol intermediate to yield an α-haloketone. The question conveniently provides the reactive enol intermediate as the starting material.\n\n<<<B>>>"
