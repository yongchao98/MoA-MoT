    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\nThe decay process is:\nInitial Nucleon-Nucleon state (NN_i) → Final Nucleon-Nucleon state (NN_f) + Particle X\n\nWe must check each option against the following physical laws and principles described in the problem:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P)**: The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons**: For a two-nucleon system, the total state must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L), total spin (S), and isospin (T) quantum numbers must be odd: `L + S + T = odd`. The problem provides an equivalent formula: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\nLet's first establish the properties of the initial and final states based on the problem description.\n\n### Initial State: `1S0`\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` gives:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  ⇒  `S(NN)_i = 0`\n    *   `L` is 'S'   ⇒  `L(NN)_i = 0`\n    *   `J` is 0     ⇒  `J(NN)_i = 0`\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L(NN)_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### Final State: `NN_f + X`\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3). We assume X is a scalar particle (spin `s_X = 0`).\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\nNow let's derive the specific selection rules for this decay.\n\n**1. Angular Momentum Conservation (`J_i = J_f`)**:\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum `J(NN)_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `j_X`. Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_f = J(NN)_f + l_X` (vector sum). For `J_f` to be 0, we must have `J(NN)_f = l_X`.\n\n**2. Parity Conservation (`P_i = P_f`)**:\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN)_f * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L(NN)_f`.\n*   `+1 = (-1)^L(NN)_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L(NN)_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN)_f + l_X + 1` must be even, which means `L(NN)_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State (`T_f + S_f + L_f = odd`)**:\n*   The problem states `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Therefore, the condition becomes `S(NN)_f + L(NN)_f` must be **odd**.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option against these three rules.\n\n---\n### A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` ⇒ `S_f=3`. `L=D` ⇒ `L_f=2`. `J_f=1`.\n*   A state with `S=3` cannot be formed from two spin-1/2 nucleons, whose total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This transition is not permitted.\n\n### B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. `J_f = l_X`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (Satisfied)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. `J_f = l_X`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n*   This transition is not permitted.\n\n### D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. `J_f = l_X`. (Satisfied)\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n3.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Satisfied)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n---\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **A)** is not permitted because a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin of S=3.\n*   **C)** is not permitted because the final NN state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the Pauli exclusion principle (`S+L` must be odd, but here `1+1=2` is even).\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if two options appear to be invalid, one must consider the intent of the question. The problem explicitly provides the formula for the Pauli principle and specifies the final isospin state `T=0`. This suggests that the primary skill being tested is the application of all selection rules, particularly the non-trivial Pauli constraint. Option (C) is forbidden precisely by this rule, after satisfying the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity. The issue with option (A) is a more basic error in the construction of a valid quantum state for two nucleons, which could potentially be a typo (`7` instead of `3`). Assuming the question is designed to test the detailed selection rules provided, the violation in (C) is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
