    "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we will use the formula:\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle$ denotes the expectation value of an operator $A$ for a given state $\\psi$. The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle A \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger A \\psi$.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is given in matrix form as:\n$P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector:\n$\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe conjugate transpose of the state vector, $\\psi^\\dagger$, is:\n$\\psi^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n\nFirst, we compute the product $P_z \\psi$:\n$P_z \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we multiply this result by $\\psi^\\dagger$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger (P_z \\psi) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$ by squaring the $P_z$ matrix:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi$\n\nFirst, compute $P_z^2 \\psi$:\n$P_z^2 \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, multiply by $\\psi^\\dagger$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger (P_z^2 \\psi) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n\nNow we substitute the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty of $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
