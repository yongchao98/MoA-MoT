    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify substance Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\nThis value is an excellent match for 14.28%. Thus, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Additionally, the problem mentions that substance Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. This confirms that Z is a cycloalkane. Based on its common use as a solvent, we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds. It is a known chemical fact that benzene does not readily react with bromine water in the absence of a catalyst, unlike unsaturated alkenes.\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y yields only substance Z (cyclohexane). This means:\n*   Hydrogenation of C → Cyclohexane (Z)\n*   Hydrogenation of D → Cyclohexane (Z)\n\nWe also know that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C is Z.\n*   **C = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is already saturated, so its \"hydrogenation\" product is itself.\n\nNow, what is D? D must be a compound that, upon hydrogenation, yields cyclohexane. A prime candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane, although it requires severe conditions.\n\nSo, let's propose that **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\nThis fits all the criteria for Y:\n*   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water (cyclohexane is saturated; benzene is unreactive under these conditions).\n*   Hydrogenation of the mixture (cyclohexane and benzene) produces only cyclohexane.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conversion of X to Y and identify mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which undergoes disproportionation when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\nThe reaction is:\nA + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n\nThis type of reaction, where cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes are converted to a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound over a platinum catalyst, is a well-known process called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must equal the total number in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane + one molecule of benzene).\n*   Total C atoms in products = 6 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 12\n*   Total H atoms in products = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18\n\nTherefore, the combined molecular formula of A and B is C12H18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the properties of mixture X**\n\nLet's check if we can find plausible structures for A and B that fit the remaining criteria.\n*   **Equimolar mixture:** Let A and B be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   **Total hydrogens:** a + b = 18.\n*   **Decolorize bromine water:** A and B must be unsaturated (contain double or triple bonds).\n*   **Hydrogenate to cyclohexane:** A and B must have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n*   **No conjugated multiple bonds:** This rules out compounds like cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\nA suitable pair for A and B would be **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   **Unsaturated:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both will hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   **Non-conjugated:** Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) → C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)\n\nThis scenario is chemically sound and consistent with all the information given in the problem. The core of the solution lies in the stoichiometric balance of the disproportionation reaction.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one of B) is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
