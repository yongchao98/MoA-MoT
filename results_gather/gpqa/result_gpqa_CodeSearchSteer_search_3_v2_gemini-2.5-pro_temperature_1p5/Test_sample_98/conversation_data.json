    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data are analyzed and compared against the four possible structures.\n\n**FTIR Spectroscopy**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nAll four given options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the correct functional group is present but does not help to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**1H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns reported in the 1H NMR spectrum. Signal splitting arises from the interaction of a proton's magnetic field with the magnetic fields of non-equivalent protons on adjacent atoms (spin-spin coupling).\n\nThe two crucial signals are:\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern indicates a proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component arises from coupling to a single neighboring proton (a CH group).\n    *   The **triplet (t)** component arises from coupling to a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   The **quartet (q)** component arises from coupling to a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to:\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component from a single neighboring proton (a CH group).\n    *   One **triplet (t)** from a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   A second **triplet (t)** from another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (a different CH₂ group).\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nEach structure is analyzed to determine if it contains protons with the necessary neighboring environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This structure contains a proton that is adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group, which could produce a `dtq`. However, it lacks a proton that is adjacent to a CH and two distinct CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This structure has a proton adjacent to a CH and two different CH₂ groups, making it a candidate for the `dtt` signal. However, no proton in this molecule has the correct set of neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) to produce a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule contains a proton that could give a `dtq` signal. However, like structure A, it does not have a proton environment that would lead to a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** Let's examine the structure: `COOH-CH₂(α)-CH(a)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-CH₃(g)`.\n    *   The proton labeled **H(d)** on carbon-4 is adjacent to the proton **H(a)** on carbon-3 (1H, creating a doublet), the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (2H, creating a triplet), and the terminal **CH₃** group (3H, creating a quartet). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) makes **H(d)** a perfect candidate for the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   The proton labeled **H(a)** on carbon-3 is adjacent to the proton **H(d)** on carbon-4 (1H, creating a doublet), the **CH₂(α)** group (2H, creating a triplet), and the **CH₂** of its own ethyl group (2H, creating another triplet). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) makes **H(a)** a candidate for the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n\nOnly structure B contains protons in environments that can account for both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
