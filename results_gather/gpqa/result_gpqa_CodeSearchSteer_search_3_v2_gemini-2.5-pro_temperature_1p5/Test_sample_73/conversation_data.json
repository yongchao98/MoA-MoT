    "The correct approach to this problem relies on the fundamental principle that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    The probability of a nucleus surviving for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e⁻ˡᵗ, where λ is the decay constant. The probability of decay is therefore P(decay) = 1 - e⁻ˡᵗ.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n    *   P(survival in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n    We can now set up the equation to find λ:\n    0.68 = e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁰⁰⁾\n    Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(0.68) = -100λ\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n    λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\n    λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, we calculate the probability for a 150-minute interval, regardless of the previous 50 minutes.\n\n    Using the decay probability formula with t = 150 minutes and the value of λ we just found:\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁵⁰⁾\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻⁽⁰∙⁰⁰³⁸⁵⁷⁾⁽¹⁵⁰⁾\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻⁰∙⁵⁷⁸⁵⁵\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n3.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n    *Alternatively, without calculating the explicit value of λ, we can use a more direct mathematical approach:*\n    From Step 1, we have e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.68.\n    The probability of decay in 150 minutes is P = 1 - e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ.\n    We can rewrite e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ as (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹∙⁵.\n    Substituting the known value: P = 1 - (0.68)¹∙⁵.\n    P ≈ 1 - 0.5598\n    P ≈ 0.4402\n    This confirms the probability is approximately 44%.\n\nThe correct option is therefore 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
