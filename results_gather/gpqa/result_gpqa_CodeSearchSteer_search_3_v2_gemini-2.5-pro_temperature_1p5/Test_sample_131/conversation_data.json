    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compounds in the 1:1 mixture have the formula C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound produces one singlet in the aromatic region. A singlet arises when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) on the benzene ring has no adjacent protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the total methyl (or ethyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each of the candidate compounds**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no neighboring protons, so they will appear as a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (12H).\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (~6.9-7.0 ppm) and one alkyl singlet (~2.2-2.3 ppm).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The same plane of symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent (6H total). The methyl group at C2 (3H) is unique, and the methyl group at C5 (3H) is unique. This results in three separate singlets. The integration ratio of these alkyl singlets is 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (~6.7-6.8 ppm) and three alkyl singlets (~2.2-2.3 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They would couple and split each other's signals, resulting in two doublets (an AX system), not a singlet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated as it does not produce a singlet in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry and will produce a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will not be singlets. The CH2 protons are adjacent to the CH3 protons, which would result in a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because it produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two compounds must be chosen from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, as the other two options are inconsistent with the data.\n\nLet's consider a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are slightly different, the 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   This is the key part of the problem. The spectrum of the mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene *by itself* produces three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The spectrum of pure 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has only one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n    *   If these two were mixed, we would expect four signals in the alkyl region (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   There seems to be a misunderstanding of the question's phrasing. \"There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" This could describe the spectrum of *one* of the components, which is then mixed with another.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds...exhibits...three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"\n\nThis implies that the *total* alkyl region of the mixture consists of these three signals. Let's reconsider the combination:\n\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n    *   **Alkyl signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 1 singlet.\n    *   The total number of expected alkyl signals is four, not three.\n\nThere must be an overlap. Let's assume the single, large (12H) singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the largest (6H) singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   The combined signal would have an integration of 12H + 6H = 18H.\n*   The other two signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would be 3H and 3H.\n*   The resulting ratio would be 18:3:3, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the initial analysis. The most straightforward interpretation is that one of the compounds gives the 2:1:1 alkyl signal pattern, and the other compound's signals are somehow accounted for.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** perfectly gives three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** gives one alkyl singlet.\n\nWhat if the prompt is interpreted such that the total proton environment leads to this final ratio?\nLet the two compounds be A and B in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nThe total number of protons in compound A is 14. The total number in compound B is 14.\nThe aromatic protons are 2H from A and 2H from B, giving the 1:1 ratio.\nThe alkyl protons are 12H from A and 12H from B. Total alkyl protons = 24H.\nThe signals in the alkyl region are in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total parts in this ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\nSo, the three signals correspond to:\n*   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n*   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n\nNow let's see if we can form these integrals from a 1:1 mixture of two of our valid compounds.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (one 12H singlet) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H):**\n*   Signal A (1,2,4,5-): 12H\n*   Signals B (1,2,3,5-): 6H, 3H, 3H\n*   We need to combine these four signals to get three signals with integrals 12H, 6H, 6H.\n*   This is not possible without splitting a signal. For example, if the 12H signal from A is one of the final signals, we are left with 6H, 3H, 3H, which doesn't make two signals of 6H each. If the 6H from B is one of the final signals, we need to combine 12H, 3H, 3H to make signals of 12H and 6H. This is also not possible.\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the reasoning or an ambiguity in the question's description. However, let's revisit the simplest interpretation.\n\nThe prompt describes the *overall* spectrum of the mixture.\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets (1:1). This points to two different compounds each having a single type of aromatic proton environment. Both 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene fit this.\n*   Alkyl: Three singlets (2:1:1). The most direct way to get this pattern is if one of the components (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) provides exactly this pattern, and the other component's alkyl signal(s) coincidentally overlap with one of these.\n\nLet's assume the mixture is indeed **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-isomer** gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.7-6.8 ppm\n    *   Alkyl: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) -> Ratio 2:1:1\n*   **1,2,4,5-isomer** gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.9-7.0 ppm\n    *   Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.2-2.3 ppm\n\nThe description of the spectrum *exactly* matches the predicted spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene *plus* an extra aromatic singlet from another compound. If we add 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, we get the required second aromatic singlet. But we also get a very large (12H) alkyl singlet which is unaccounted for in the \"three signals\" description.\n\nPerhaps the question is poorly posed, and it's intended to be simpler. Let's reconsider the options.\n*   A and D contain 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is incorrect.\n*   C contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect.\n*   This leaves only option B as a possibility.\n\nLet's assume option B is correct and try to rationalize the alkyl spectrum. For the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, the alkyl region contains:\n*   One 12H singlet from the 1,2,4,5- isomer.\n*   Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from the 1,2,3,5- isomer.\n\nIf the problem states there are only three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap.\nThe only way to get a 2:1:1 ratio from these four signals is if the question is flawed. Let's ignore the integral ratios for a moment.\n*   Mixture of B: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Both give one aromatic singlet, so the mixture gives two. This is correct. The mixture is expected to have four alkyl singlets. The problem states three. This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt one more time. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" This is the description of the alkyl region of the final 1:1 mixture. As calculated before, a 1:1 mixture means we have 12H of alkyl protons from the first compound and 12H from the second, for a total of 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H gives signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's see if we can generate these integrals from the pair in option B:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides one 12H signal.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides one 6H signal, one 3H signal, and another 3H signal.\n*   Can we combine these (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) to get three signals of (12H, 6H, 6H)?\n    *   Yes, if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are not resolved or happen to have the same chemical shift as the 6H signal from the same molecule (unlikely) or if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene merge into a single 6H signal.\n    *   If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene merge (or are degenerate), we would have signals of 12H (from 1,2,4,5-), 6H (from 1,2,3,5-), and another 6H (from the combined 3H+3H signals of 1,2,3,5-). This gives three signals with a 12:6:6 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\nThis is the only chemically plausible explanation that fits the data. The two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are unique but could have very similar chemical shifts, leading to them appearing as a single signal integrating to 6H.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-isomer (1 singlet, 2H) + 1,2,3,5-isomer (1 singlet, 2H) -> Mixture has two singlets, 1:1 ratio. Correct.\n2.  **Alkyl signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer provides a 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-isomer provides a 6H singlet (C1+C3 methyls) and two 3H singlets (C2 and C5 methyls).\n    *   Assume the two 3H singlets from the 1,2,3,5-isomer overlap to give one 6H signal.\n    *   The total signals for the mixture are: 12H singlet, 6H singlet, and another 6H singlet.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which is 2:1:1. Correct.\n\nThis confirms that the compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
