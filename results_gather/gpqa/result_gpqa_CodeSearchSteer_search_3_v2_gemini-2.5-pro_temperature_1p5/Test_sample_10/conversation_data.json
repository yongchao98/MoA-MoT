    "The correct answer is A. Here is an analysis of each statement:\n\n*   **A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.**\n    This statement is **incorrect**. While it is true that nsp10 and nsp14 form a heterodimeric complex with proofreading (mismatch repair) exonuclease activity, and that the N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds nsp10 to form this active complex, the function of this complex is to **degrade** or **hydrolyze** RNA, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). It does not prevent the breakdown of dsRNA; rather, it actively breaks it down as part of its function. Research indicates the nsp10/nsp14 complex hydrolyzes dsRNA in a 3' to 5' direction.\n\n*   **B) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.**\n    This statement is **correct**. Studies have shown that the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic pathway, without altering the expression of Bcl-2, which is central to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. This evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ORF3a triggers apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway.\n\n*   **C) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.**\n    This statement is **correct**. Coronaviruses use a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF) to synthesize their polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). [9, 11] This process is mediated by a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA structure called a pseudoknot. [6, 11] The frameshifting signal of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and has been shown to have virtually the same conformation and function as that of SARS-CoV. [7, 13]\n\n*   **D) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.**\n    This statement is **correct**. Research has established a correlation between the conformational plasticity of a pseudoknot (its ability to adopt multiple conformations) and its frameshifting efficiency. [7, 25] Specifically, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting elements have been observed to adopt two main conformations under tension, which is consistent with their measured frameshifting rates.
