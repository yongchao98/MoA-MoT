    "The initial analysis was correct. Let's formalize the answer based on the confirmed selectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reagents:**\n    *   **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** The search results confirm that LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. While it is stronger than sodium borohydride, it is milder than lithium aluminum hydride and will not reduce a carboxylic acid functional group. The reaction of LiBH₄ with a dicarboxylic acid monoester results in the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol, which then allows for the formation of a lactone.\n    *   **Borane (BH₃):** The search results clearly state that borane (often as a THF or dimethyl sulfide complex) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n*   **Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    1.  The starting material A is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    2.  The reagent, LiBH₄, selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  This creates a hydroxy acid intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the carboxylic acid, which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) with the newly formed hydroxyl group to yield the δ-lactone product.\n    5.  The chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material becomes the chiral center at the 4-position of the lactone. This center is not involved in the reduction or cyclization reactions, so its stereochemistry is retained.\n    6.  Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have been **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n*   **Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n    1.  The starting material B is also a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid: (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n    2.  The reagent, BH₃, selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    3.  This creates a hydroxy ester intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) likely catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone ring and displacing isobutanol.\n    5.  As in the first reaction, the stereocenter at the 3-position is unaffected and retains its configuration.\n    6.  Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have been **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
