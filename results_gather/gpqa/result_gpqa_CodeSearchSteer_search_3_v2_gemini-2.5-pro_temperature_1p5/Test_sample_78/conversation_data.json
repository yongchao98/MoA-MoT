    "To identify Compound X, we must first determine the structure of the reaction product from the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data.\n\n### Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra\n\n1.  **¹³C-NMR Spectrum**: The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone due to its chemical shift. The presence of multiple signals in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 126-145 ppm) and two signals in the aliphatic region (δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm) suggests a complex structure. The formula of Compound X is C₁₁H₁₂O, and the reaction is an isomerization, so the product has the same formula.\n\n2.  **¹H-NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Aromatic Region**: The two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) are highly indicative of a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Methyl Signals**: The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) correspond to two methyl groups that have no adjacent protons. One is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other is part of the ketone functional group (a methyl ketone).\n    *   **Alkene Region**: The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) suggest two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond that are coupled to each other.\n\n### Deducing the Product's Structure\n\nCombining these observations, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a *para*-substituted tolyl group. The structure is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n*   The `(4-methylphenyl)` group, or *p*-tolyl group, accounts for the `CH₃-C₆H₄-` fragment, explaining the `p`-substituted pattern in the ¹H-NMR and one of the methyl singlets (δ 2.31).\n*   The `but-3-en-2-one` fragment accounts for the `-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃` part. This explains the two vinyl proton doublets, the ketone in the ¹³C-NMR, and the second methyl singlet (δ 2.28).\n*   Literature data for (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one confirms this assignment, with reported ¹H-NMR signals at δ 7.48 (d, 1H), 7.43 (d, 2H), 7.19 (d, 2H), 6.66 (d, 1H), and 2.36 (s, 6H, for both methyls). While the exact values differ slightly from the problem statement, the pattern of signals (two vinyl doublets, two aromatic doublets, two methyl singlets) is identical.\n\n### Identifying Compound X\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) to (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, catalyzed by the base DABCO at elevated temperature. We must now evaluate the given options to see which starting material could lead to this product.\n\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: The product contains a *p*-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). The reaction is an isomerization, meaning atoms are rearranged, not added or removed. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a *p*-tolyl group.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   A) **2-styrylepoxide**: Contains a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not a tolyl group. Also, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   B) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: The (4-methylstyryl) group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. The molecule's structure is `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O, and contains the required *p*-tolyl group. The base-catalyzed rearrangement of this vinylic epoxide can plausibly lead to the observed α,β-unsaturated ketone product.\n*   C) **2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**: Contains a phenyl group, not a tolyl group.\n*   D) **2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**: Contains a styryl group (which has a phenyl group), not a tolyl group.\n\nBased on the conservation of the molecular skeleton, only option B has the necessary *p*-tolyl group that is observed in the final product. The reaction is a base-catalyzed isomerization of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
