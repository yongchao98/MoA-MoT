    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\n**1. Interpretation of IR Spectrum:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n*   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, Compound X is identified as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Interpretation of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is a clear indication of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxylic acid group on the adjacent ortho protons.\n*   **Alkyl Side Chain Signals:**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) split by neighboring protons.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to a methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring and other protons.\n\n**Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\nThe data for the alkyl group is consistent with a *sec*-butyl group, [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃], attached to the benzene ring.\n*   The methine proton (-CH-) is at 2.9 ppm.\n*   The adjacent methyl group protons (-CH(C**H₃**)) are the doublet at 1.4 ppm.\n*   The methylene group protons (-CH₂-) are the multiplet at 1.7 ppm.\n*   The terminal methyl group protons (-CH₂C**H₃**) are the triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nCombining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction reaction. This reagent combination is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the carboxyl group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction for a generic carboxylic acid is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI + Red P → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this case, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the benzoic acid's carboxyl group to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group on the ring remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\nB) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\nC) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\nD) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
