    "The reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism. Based on the principles of this reaction, the outcome for the specified reactant can be determined by following two key rules regarding regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.\n\n**1. Reactants Analysis:**\n*   **Epoxide:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic compound containing a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The epoxide connects carbons 1 and 6 of the cyclohexane core.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent, which serves as a source for a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n**2. Regioselectivity:**\nThe first rule dictates that the nucleophile from the organocuprate will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   Carbon-1 (C1) of the epoxide is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to the other ring carbons.\n*   Carbon-6 (C6) of the epoxide is a secondary carbon, bonded only to hydrogen and the other ring carbons.\nFollowing this rule, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) will preferentially attack the less hindered C6.\n\n**3. Stereoselectivity:**\nThe second rule states that the reaction is an S_N2-type attack, which means the nucleophile adds to the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond, resulting in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon center that is attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the attacked carbon, C6, is (S).\n*   Due to the S_N2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become (R).\nThe configurations of the other chiral centers in the molecule (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps and thus retain their original configurations.\n\n**4. Product Formation:**\nThe nucleophilic attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1. The product is therefore a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n**5. Product Identification:**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The final product is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   The stereochemistry at the chiral centers is determined as follows:\n    *   **C1:** Retains its (R) configuration.\n    *   **C2 (originally C6):** Inverts from (S) to (R).\n    *   **C4 (originally C4):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n    *   **C5 (originally C3):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the full IUPAC name of the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
