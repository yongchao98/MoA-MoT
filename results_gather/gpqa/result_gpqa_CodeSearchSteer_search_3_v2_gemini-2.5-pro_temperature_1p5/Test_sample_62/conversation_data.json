    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the initial and final states of the molecule. The photon's momentum (p) is then found using the relation p = ΔE / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of the Rovibrational Model\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For rovibrational spectroscopy of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules for an allowed transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Since the initial vibrational state is `v = 0`, the next vibrational state must be `v = 1`.\n    *   Since the initial rotational state is `J = 0`, the only possible change is ΔJ = +1, leading to a final rotational state of `J = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nFirst, we find the energy of the initial and final states:\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between these states:\n*   **ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + (ħ² / I) ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\n**a. Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass for a diatomic molecule with atomic masses Mx and My is:\n*   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n*   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n*   Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia is I = μR², where R is the bond length.\n*   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n*   I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Calculate the Energy Terms:**\n*   Vibrational term: ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational term: ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.18 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d. Calculate Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n*   ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.18 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculate Photon Momentum (p)\n\nFinally, we find the momentum using the energy-momentum relation for a photon.\n*   p = ΔE / c (where c is the speed of light, ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
