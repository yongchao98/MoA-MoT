    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its star. Assuming the star's luminosity (L) and the planet's albedo (A) and surface area are constant factors, the temperature is primarily dependent on its distance (d) from the star. The relationship is given by:\n    T ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4)\n    This simplifies to:\n    T ∝ 1/√d\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T₄) and Planet_2 (T₂) is:\n    T₄ / T₂ = √(d₂ / d₄)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the same as the orbital distance (d).\n    P² ∝ d³\n    This can be rearranged to express the distance in terms of the period:\n    d ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n    So, the ratio of the distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:\n    d₂ / d₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combining the Ratios:** Now, we substitute the distance ratio from Kepler's Law into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T₄ / T₂ = √[(P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)]\n    T₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculation:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we have:\n    *   P₂ = 2 (in some unit)\n    *   P₄ = 3.5 (in the same unit)\n\n    Plugging these values into our derived formula:\n    T₄ / T₂ = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T₄ / T₂ = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    T₄ / T₂ ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    T₄ / T₂ ≈ 0.8298\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
