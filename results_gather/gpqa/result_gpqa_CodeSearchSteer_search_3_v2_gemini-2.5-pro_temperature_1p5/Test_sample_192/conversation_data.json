    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Identify the given relationship:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with parallax (plx) as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as the number of stars per unit of parallax, which is a density in parallax space. We can write this as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the desired relationship:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance (r). This is the density in distance space, which can be written as:\n    `dN/dr`\n\n3.  **Recall the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For distance `r` in parsecs, the parallax `plx` in arcseconds is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule for derivatives to transform the variables:**\n    To convert the density from parallax space (`dN/d(plx)`) to distance space (`dN/dr`), we use the chain rule:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative of parallax with respect to distance:**\n    Using the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we find the derivative:\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    Since we are interested in how the number of stars *changes* (the proportionality), we can consider the magnitude of this relationship, which is `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation:**\n    We combine the expressions from steps 1 and 5 into the formula from step 4:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of the desired variable, r:**\n    Now, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ * (1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance with a proportionality of `r³`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
