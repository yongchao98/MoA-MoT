    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than the natural energy width of each level. This energy width is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that a finite lifetime (Δt) of a state leads to an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ΔE is the energy uncertainty (or energy width), Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Using the lifetime (τ) as Δt, the minimum energy width for a state is approximately:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy width for each of the two quantum states using the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**For the first state (E₁):**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state (E₂):**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the energy difference between them (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\n\nRequired energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired energy difference > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nRequired energy difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to ensure that the two energy levels do not overlap and can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>"
