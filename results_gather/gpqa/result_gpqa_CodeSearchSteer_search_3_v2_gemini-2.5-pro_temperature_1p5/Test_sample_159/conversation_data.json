    "An N-sided polygonal aperture with a constant apothem `a` will approach the shape of a circle as N becomes infinitely large. The radius of this circle will be equal to the apothem, `a`. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the light intensity.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter `D`, the angular positions of the intensity minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ ≈ m * (λ / D)\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light and `m` is a coefficient that determines the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the aperture is `a`, so its diameter `D` is `2a`. The positions of the minima are found at specific angles related to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nThe first minimum occurs at an angle θ₁ given by:\nθ₁ ≈ 1.22 * (λ / D) = 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\nThe second minimum occurs at an angle θ₂ given by:\nθ₂ ≈ 2.23 * (λ / D) = 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.505 λ / a is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
