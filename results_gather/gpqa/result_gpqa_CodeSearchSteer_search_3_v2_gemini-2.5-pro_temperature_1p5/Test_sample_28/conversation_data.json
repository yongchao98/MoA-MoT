  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "To identify which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must determine which change in the DNA sequence is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\nTranslating this from the start codon (ATG), the first few amino acids are:\n*   **ATG**: Methionine (Start)\n*   **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n*   **CTC**: Leucine\n*   **GCT**: Alanine\n\nNow, let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTC**: Phenylalanine (same as TTT, a silent mutation)\n    *   **TAC**: Tyrosine\n    This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this could potentially affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTC**: Phenylalanine\n    *   **TAA**: **Stop codon**\n    This mutation is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate, resulting in a drastically shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein, consisting of only two amino acids.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n    *   **TAC**: Tyrosine\n    Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid Leucine to Tyrosine. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence provided for Mutant 4 (`5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3'`) compared to the intact gene (`5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...-3'`) shows multiple complex changes. However, if we interpret it as having a `CTC` to `TAC` change, it would also be a missense mutation like Mutants 1 and 3. In any case, it does not introduce a stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to completely abolish the function of the protein. Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon, which will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This makes it the most probable candidate for eliminating the targeted anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
