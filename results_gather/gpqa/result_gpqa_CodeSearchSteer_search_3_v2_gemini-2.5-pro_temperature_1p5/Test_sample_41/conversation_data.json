    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to the luminosity of its star (L), its albedo (A), and its orbital distance (a). The relationship is given by:\n\nT_eq ∝ [ (1-A) / a² ]¹/⁴\n\nFor planets orbiting the same star, L is constant. The problem states that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a²)¹/⁴ = 1 / a¹/²\n\nThis means that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets (i and j) is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\nT_i / T_j = (a_j / a_i)¹/²\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the orbital distances:\n\na_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)²\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   T₁ / T₂ ≈ 1.4\n*   T₂ / T₃ ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   a₂ / a₁ = (T₁ / T₂)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n*   a₃ / a₂ = (T₂ / T₃)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a₃/a₁), we multiply the two intermediate ratios:\n\na₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n### 3. Apply Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law can be expressed as a ratio:\n\n(P_i / P_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P₃/P₁). Rearranging the formula:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)³/²\n\n### 4. Calculate the Final Orbital Period Ratio\n\nUsing the value of a₃/a₁ calculated in Step 2:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)³/²\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)¹·⁵ ≈ 33.385\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not necessary for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe calculated factor of ~33.4 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
