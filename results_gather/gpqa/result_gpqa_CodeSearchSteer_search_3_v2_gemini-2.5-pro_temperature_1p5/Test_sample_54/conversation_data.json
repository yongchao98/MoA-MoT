    "Based on the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet, integrating to three protons, is characteristic of the methyl group (CH₃) of an acetate ester (CH₃-COO-). All four potential compounds contain this group, so this signal is expected.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet, integrating to three protons, indicates a methyl group (CH₃) that is adjacent to a single proton. This fits the `CH₃-CH=` portion of a propenyl group. Butenyl acetate would have an ethyl group attached to the double bond, which would show a different splitting pattern (a triplet and a quartet). This allows us to rule out both butenyl acetate options.\n*   **Vinyl Proton Signals and Coupling Constant:** The signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm are in the region for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons).\n    *   **J = 16.0 Hz:** The key piece of data is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz for the doublet at 7.0 ppm. Coupling constants for protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz. In contrast, *cis* protons show a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-12 Hz. The large value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinyl protons.\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents one proton that is split into a doublet of quartets. The doublet splitting is due to coupling with the other vinyl proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The quartet splitting is caused by the three neighboring protons of the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):** This downfield signal is a doublet because it is only coupled to the other vinyl proton (at 5.5 ppm). Its significant downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom in the ester group (-O-CO-CH₃).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of signals, their integrations, and splitting patterns are all consistent with a propenyl acetate structure. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz specifically identifies the isomer as *trans*.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
