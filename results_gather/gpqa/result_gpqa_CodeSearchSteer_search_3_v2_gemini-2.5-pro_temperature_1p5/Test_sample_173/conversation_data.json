    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus: E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV = 300,000 MeV.\n    *   Initial momentum: P_initial = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies T₁ and T₂, and momenta p₁ and p₂.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFrom the given information, we can find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n*   (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300,000 MeV = 297,000 MeV.\n*   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we can write (2m₂ + m₂)c² = 3m₂c² = 297,000 MeV.\n*   Solving for m₂c², we get: m₂c² = 99,000 MeV.\n*   And for m₁c², we get: m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 198,000 MeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, according to the principle of energy conservation.\n*   Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300,000 MeV - 297,000 MeV = 3,000 MeV.\n\n### 4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, the conservation of momentum (P_initial = 0) means the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: p₁ = -p₂, so |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The classical kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m).\n*   Therefore, T₁ = p² / (2m₁) and T₂ = p² / (2m₂).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: T₁ / T₂ = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2.\n*   This implies T₂ = 2T₁.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁ + T₂ = 3,000 MeV.\n*   Substituting T₂: T₁ + 2T₁ = 3T₁ = 3,000 MeV.\n*   This gives the classical value for T₁: **T₁ (classical) = 1,000 MeV**.\n\n### 5. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of momentum, |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum (p), energy (E), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   This can be rewritten as (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². Since the total energy is E = T + mc², we get (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Since the momenta are equal: (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²).\n*   We know T₂ = 3,000 - T₁. Substituting this and the mass-energy values into the equation:\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198,000) = (3,000 - T₁)² + 2(3,000 - T₁)(99,000)\n    *   T₁² + 396,000T₁ = (9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + T₁²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000T₁)\n*   Simplifying the equation by canceling the T₁² terms on both sides:\n    *   396,000T₁ = 9,000,000 - 6,000T₁ + 594,000,000 - 198,000T₁\n    *   396,000T₁ = 603,000,000 - 204,000T₁\n*   Grouping the T₁ terms:\n    *   396,000T₁ + 204,000T₁ = 603,000,000\n    *   600,000T₁ = 603,000,000\n*   Solving for the relativistic T₁:\n    *   **T₁ (relativistic) = 603,000,000 / 600,000 = 1,005 MeV**.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1,005 MeV - 1,000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
