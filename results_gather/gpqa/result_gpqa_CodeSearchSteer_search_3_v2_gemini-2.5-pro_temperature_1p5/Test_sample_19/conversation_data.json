    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a foundational concept that simplifies the complex problem of a probe interacting with a nucleus. It rests on a few key assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the state of the nucleons. Analyzing the provided options in the context of the standard definition of the impulse approximation reveals the correct combination.\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a core tenet of the impulse approximation. The total interaction is treated as a sum of interactions with each nucleon independently, rather than a more complex interaction with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon currents. This is often referred to as the single-body operator assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption, often associated with the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), posits that the probe particle (e.g., an electron or neutrino) interacts with the target nucleon, and then the struck nucleon exits the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining (A-1) nucleons. This neglects final-state interactions (FSI), where the outgoing particle's path is distorted by the nuclear potential.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The interaction is assumed to be so rapid (occurring over a very short time scale) that the forces binding the nucleon to the nucleus are negligible *during* the collision. Therefore, the nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle at the moment of interaction. Investigations into the validity of the impulse approximation often focus on the energy of the interaction compared to the nucleon's binding energy.\n\nThe third option presented, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. This is a feature of a specific nucleon model (like a non-relativistic quark model) and is a separate layer of approximation from the impulse approximation, which treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle and describes its behavior within the nucleus during a high-energy interaction. The impulse approximation can be used with various models of the nucleon's structure.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are the interaction with individual nucleons, the transparency of the nucleus to the involved particles, and the neglect of nucleon binding forces during the brief interaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
