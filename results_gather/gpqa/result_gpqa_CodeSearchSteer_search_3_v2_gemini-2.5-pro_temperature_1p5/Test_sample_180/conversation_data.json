    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The Sun produces neutrinos from several reactions. The ones relevant to the energy bands of 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV are:\n    *   **pp-II branch:** Produces mono-energetic neutrinos from ⁷Be electron capture, most prominently a very strong line at 861 keV. This falls squarely in **band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **pp-III branch:** Produces ⁸B neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in **both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos with continuous spectra that also contribute to **both band 1 and band 2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the hypothetical change:** The pp-III branch stops. This means the production of ⁸B neutrinos ceases. Since the question states this happened about 8.5 minutes ago (the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun), we observe this change on Earth now. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\n3.  **Determine the flux after the change:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The primary contributor from the proton-proton chain, the ⁸B neutrinos, has disappeared. The only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy band is from the CNO cycle. Therefore, `Flux(band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)`.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The contribution from ⁸B neutrinos is gone. However, the very strong flux from the ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV is unaffected, as the pp-II branch continues normally. There is also a small remaining contribution from the CNO cycle. So, `Flux(band 2) = Flux_Be7(at 861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)`.\n\n4.  **Estimate the ratio:** We need to find the ratio `Flux(band 1) / Flux(band 2)`.\n    *   The flux from the ⁷Be line is immense compared to the continuum flux from the CNO cycle in that narrow energy band. The total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos is about 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos cm⁻² s⁻¹, while the integrated CNO flux over band 2 would be many orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, we can approximate `Flux(band 2) ≈ Flux_Be7`.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to: `Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) / Flux_Be7`.\n\n5.  **Quantify the fluxes:**\n    *   The total flux of the ⁷Be line is `Φ(⁷Be) ≈ 5.0 x 10⁹ cm⁻² s⁻¹`. Since this entire flux is within band 2, this is our denominator.\n    *   The total flux of CNO neutrinos (from ¹³N and ¹⁵O) has been measured by the Borexino experiment to be approximately `Φ(CNO) ≈ 7 x 10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹`. This flux is spread across a continuous spectrum up to about 1.7 MeV.\n    *   We need to estimate what fraction of this total CNO flux falls within the 100 keV-wide window of band 1. The total CNO spectrum is about 1700 keV wide. A 100 keV slice represents about `100/1700 ≈ 6%` of the energy range. Assuming a relatively flat distribution near the peak, a reasonable estimate for the fraction of flux in this band is between 5% and 10%. Let's use 7% (`0.07`).\n    *   `Flux_CNO(700-800 keV) ≈ 0.07 * Φ(CNO) ≈ 0.07 * (7 x 10⁸ cm⁻² s⁻¹) = 4.9 x 10⁷ cm⁻² s⁻¹`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final ratio:**\n    *   Ratio ≈ `(4.9 x 10⁷) / (5.0 x 10⁹)`\n    *   Ratio ≈ `4.9 / 500`\n    *   Ratio ≈ `0.0098`\n\nThis value is extremely close to 0.01.\n\nTherefore, the approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands is 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
