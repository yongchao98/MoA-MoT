    "The search results confirm the steps and formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The formula `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_rest)` shows that the radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ). Therefore, the ratio of the maximum radial velocities (the semi-amplitudes, K) is equal to the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts.\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** The search results provide the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a star with an orbiting planet. For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), the formula simplifies. Several sources confirm that K is proportional to P⁻¹ᐟ³.\n    The general form is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:**\n    *   We are given M₁ = M₂.\n    *   The phrase \"detected... both with masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that the measured quantity, the minimum mass (`m_p * sin(i)`), is the same for both planets.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio K₂ / K₁ simplifies to `(P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    *   (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    *   2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result matches option C. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by the literature.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\nQuestion: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? (i.e., find P₂/P₁)\nOptions: A) ~ 0.85, B) ~ 1.96, C) ~ 0.36, D) ~ 1.40\nThe calculated answer is ~0.36.\n\nThe logic holds. No more information is needed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
