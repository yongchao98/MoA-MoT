    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main factors: the star's visibility from both observatories and its apparent brightness.\n\n**1. Observational Requirements:**\n\n*   **HIRES (W. M. Keck Observatory):** Requires stars to be brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16.\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):** Requires stars to be brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 17.\n*   **Combined Requirement:** For a star to be observable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be **brighter than 16 mag**.\n*   **Location Constraints:** The Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere (approx. +20° latitude), while the Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (approx. -24° latitude). A star must be in a declination (DEC) range visible from both locations. Allowing for observations down to the horizon, this overlapping range is roughly from DEC = -70° to DEC = +66°.\n\n**2. Star-by-Star Analysis:**\n\nFor each star, we calculate its final observed apparent magnitude (`m_V`) and check its declination. The apparent magnitude is calculated from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d`), and visual extinction (`A_V`) using the formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10pc) + A_V`. The extinction `A_V` is `3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star1 - RA = 15 deg and DEC = -75 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance.**\n    *   **Visibility:** At DEC = -75°, this star is not visible from Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star2 - RA = 30 deg and DEC = 55 deg, apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag.**\n    *   **Brightness:** The given apparent magnitude is 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the 16 mag limit for the HIRES spectrograph.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag.**\n    *   **Visibility:** At DEC = +48°, this star is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is explicitly given as 15.5 mag. This value is brighter than the 16 mag limit. The additional information on color excess (E(B-V)) is consistent with the physics of a star at the given distance but does not alter the stated apparent magnitude.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star4 - RA = 85 deg and DEC = -48 deg, absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag and located at 10 pc distance.**\n    *   **Visibility:** At DEC = -48°, this star is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** First, we calculate the apparent magnitude without extinction: `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5`. Next, we calculate the extinction: `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag. The final observed magnitude is `15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag. This is fainter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star5 - RA = 10 h and DEC = 60 deg, absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance.**\n    *   **Visibility:** At DEC = +60°, this star is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude: `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995` mag. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, Star3 and Star5 are the only stars that satisfy both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<D>>>"
