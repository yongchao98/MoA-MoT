    "The problem requires determining the Lorentz factor (γ) needed for a specific fraction of decaying particles to reach a detector. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the exponential decay law.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Survival Fraction Formula**: The fraction of particles (`f`) that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the relativistic decay formula. The decay is based on the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`), but the time it experiences is dilated. In the lab frame, the effective lifetime is `γτ`. The time of flight to the detector wall is `t = R/v`, where `R` is the detector radius and `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` with the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n\n    The survival fraction is therefore:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n2.  **Initial Condition**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `1/3 = exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the constant part of the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n\n    This gives us a value for the constant term `k = R / (c * τ)`:\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n3.  **Final Condition**: We need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector.\n    *   `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ)) = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n\n4.  **Calculate γ₂**: Now we can solve for `γ₂` and substitute the expression for `k` we found in step 2:\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.18 is closest to the option 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
