    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   M₁V₁ = (0.05 mol/L) * (0.02000 L) = 0.001 moles\n*   **New volume:**\n    *   V₂ = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid (Cₐ):**\n    *   Cₐ = Moles / V₂ = 0.001 moles / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt this stage, we have a buffer solution containing acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), formed by the reaction with NaOH. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH.\n\n*   **Determine the volume of NaOH at the equivalence point (Vₑ):** This is where the moles of acid equal the moles of base.\n    *   CₐVₐ = CₙₐₒₕVₑ\n    *   (0.025 M) * (40.00 cm³) = (0.1 M) * Vₑ\n    *   Vₑ = (0.025 * 40.00) / 0.1 = 10.00 cm³\n*   **At 25% titration:** 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base. This means the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized and converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base that hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]):**\n    *   Moles of acetate = Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (initial solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH added) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 moles / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:** The relationship between Kₐ, Kₑ, and Kₓ (the ion product of water, 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C) is Kₐ * Kₑ = Kₓ.\n    *   Kₑ = Kₓ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction:**\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can simplify: x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26 and at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<A>>>"
