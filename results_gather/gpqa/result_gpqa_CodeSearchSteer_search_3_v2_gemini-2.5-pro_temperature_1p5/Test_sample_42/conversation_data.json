    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, we must systematically apply the rules of chemical nomenclature.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Structure\n\nThe molecule is a derivative of benzene. The highest priority functional group determines the parent name. The functional groups present are:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂]\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position 1 (C1).\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** C1\n*   **Methoxy (-OCH₃):** \"para to the carboxylic acid\" means it is at C4.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN):** These are \"all meta to one another\" along with the carboxylic acid. With -COOH at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂]:** These are \"ortho to the carboxylic acid,\" placing them at C2 and C6.\n\n### 3. Resolve Ambiguities using Further Constraints\n\nThe description provides additional information to determine the exact positions:\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\nThe methoxy group is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (the cyano group), the nitrile must be at either C3 or C5, which is consistent with our previous placement.\n\nThe hydroxyl group (alcohol) is at C2 or C6. We have two possibilities for the position of the nitrile:\n\n*   **Case 1: Nitrile is at C3.** For the hydroxyl group to be ortho to the nitrile at C3, it must be at C2 (since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group). This places the dimethylamino group at C6 and the carbaldehyde group at C5.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n*   **Case 2: Nitrile is at C5.** For the hydroxyl group to be ortho to the nitrile at C5, it must be at C6 (since C4 is occupied). This places the dimethylamino group at C2 and the carbaldehyde group at C3.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n\nBoth resulting structures fit the description perfectly.\n\n### 4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-breaker)\n\nTo decide between these two valid structures, we must use the IUPAC tie-breaking rule for numbering. Since the set of locants (positions of substituents) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} in both cases, we must give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituents listed alphabetically are:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare the locant for the first alphabetical substituent (\"cyano\") in both cases:\n*   In Case 1, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In Case 2, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, IUPAC rules dictate that the numbering from Case 1 is correct.\n\n### 5. Construct the Final Name\n\nUsing the structure from Case 1, we list the substituents alphabetically with their corresponding locants, followed by the parent name:\n\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these gives the final IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option D. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they either violate the numbering tie-breaker rule or do not list the substituents in the correct alphabetical order.\n\n<<<D>>>"
