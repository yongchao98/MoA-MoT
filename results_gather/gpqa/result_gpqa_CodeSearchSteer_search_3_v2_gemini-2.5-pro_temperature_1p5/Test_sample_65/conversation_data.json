    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** The SMEFT Lagrangian is explicitly constructed to be invariant under the Poincare group (which includes Lorentz transformations). This is a fundamental assumption of the framework. Several sources state that SMEFT operators are built from Standard Model fields obeying gauge and Poincare symmetries. It is a local quantum field theory that is manifestly Poincar√©-invariant.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators. In fact, SMEFT is a crucial framework for studying potential new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. There are numerous studies dedicated to classifying the CP-violating operators within SMEFT. This clearly indicates that not all operators respect CP symmetry.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry:** CPT symmetry, a consequence of Lorentz invariance and locality in quantum field theory, is expected to be conserved in SMEFT. While some experimental tests search for CPT violation, this is generally considered a test of the fundamental principles of quantum field theory itself, and the standard SMEFT framework assumes CPT invariance.\n\nTherefore, Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT, while CP symmetry is not a necessary condition.\n\nThis corresponds to items 1, 2, and 4 in the question.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 1,2 - Incomplete, misses CPT.\nB) 1,3,4 - Incorrect, includes CP.\nC) 1,2,4 - Correct, includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.\nD) 3,4 - Incomplete, misses Lorentz and Poincare.\n\nThe answer is C.The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. The operators within this framework must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** As a relativistic field theory, SMEFT must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). The operators are explicitly constructed to respect this symmetry.\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, which includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian is built to be invariant under the Poincare group.\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model's weak sector. SMEFT not only incorporates this but also provides a systematic way to parameterize new, additional sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. There is extensive research on classifying the numerous CP-violating operators in SMEFT, which by definition do not respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP is not a symmetry that all SMEFT operators must respect.\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT (Charge-Parity-Time) symmetry. Since SMEFT is formulated under these principles, all of its operators are required to be CPT-invariant.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
