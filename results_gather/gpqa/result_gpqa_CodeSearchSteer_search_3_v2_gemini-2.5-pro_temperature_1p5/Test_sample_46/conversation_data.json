    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A compound with this formula has 5 degrees of unsaturation. This typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analyze the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines show two bands for asymmetric and symmetric stretching, while secondary amines show one and tertiary amines show none.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. For an ester conjugated with an aromatic ring, the C=O stretch is expected between 1730-1715 cm⁻¹. This value fits perfectly with a conjugated ester. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggest a primary aromatic amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### 3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet's significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, consistent with an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). A reported spectrum of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows this quartet at 4.31 ppm. The value of 4.5 ppm in the problem is reasonably close.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Its position is consistent with an amino group on an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amino group (-NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Also, as a primary amide, its C=O IR stretch would be closer to 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a *secondary* amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum. It also lacks a primary amine group.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has an ester group, but the ethyl part is attached to the carbonyl carbon (CH₃CH₂COO-). The -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.3-2.6 ppm in the NMR spectrum, not at 4.5 ppm. The given spectrum shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) showing two N-H bands, and a conjugated ester (-COOEt) showing a C=O band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Features an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (quartet ~4.3-4.5 ppm, triplet ~1.2-1.3 ppm), a primary amine (broad singlet ~4.0 ppm), and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with protons deshielded by the ester and shielded by the amine (two doublets ~7.0 and ~8.0 ppm).\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the compound is unequivocally identified as Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
