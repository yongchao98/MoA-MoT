    "The Mott-Gurney law describes the ideal behavior of space-charge-limited current (SCLC) and rests on several key assumptions. A breakdown of these assumptions helps to identify the correct statement:\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The theory fundamentally assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is injected and transported through the material. The presence of two carrier types would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for in the model.\n*   **Trap-Free Material:** The classic Mott-Gurney equation is derived for an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no trap states within its bandgap. If traps are present, they capture injected carriers, and the current-voltage relationship changes significantly.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For the current to be limited by the space charge within the bulk of the material, the injecting contact must be \"Ohmic\". This means it can supply an unlimited number of carriers into the semiconductor, effectively having no energy barrier to injection. A Schottky contact, which has a significant energy barrier, would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** The model assumes that the current is primarily due to the drift of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options based on these principles:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model is for a single-carrier device.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because SCLC is a drift-dominated current; neglecting drift is fundamentally wrong.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly combines all the key assumptions: a single carrier type, a trap-free medium, an ideal injecting contact (no barrier, i.e., Ohmic), and that the current is dominated by drift (negligible diffusion).\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact is non-Ohmic and would limit the injection of carriers, preventing the SCLC regime from being established.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
