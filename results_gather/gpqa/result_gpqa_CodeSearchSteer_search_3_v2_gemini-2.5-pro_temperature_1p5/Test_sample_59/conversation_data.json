    "To determine the time experienced by the astronaut, we must first establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and then apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. Various astronomical observations have provided precise measurements of its distance from Earth. According to multiple sources, the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years away. One study, published in the journal *Nature* in 2013, refined this distance to 49.97 kiloparsecs, which translates to about 163,000 light-years, with an accuracy of 2.2%. Another source gives a very specific distance of 161,663.4 light-years. For our calculation, we will use the commonly cited value of 163,000 light-years.\n\n### Time Dilation Calculation\nThe phenomenon of time dilation means that time passes differently for observers in different reference frames, especially at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\n1.  **Time from Earth's perspective:** First, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of an observer on Earth.\n    *   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n    *   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 *c* (where *c* is the speed of light)\n    *   **Time (t_earth):** Distance / Speed = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 *c*) ≈ 163,002.1 years\n\n    From Earth, the journey would take approximately 163,002 years.\n\n2.  **Time from the astronaut's perspective:** Next, we calculate the time that passes for the astronaut using the time dilation formula. The key component is the Lorentz factor (γ), which quantifies the extent of time dilation.\n\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²) ≈ 1961.16\n\n    The time experienced by the astronaut (t_astronaut) is the Earth-time divided by the Lorentz factor.\n\n    *   **t_astronaut** = t_earth / γ\n    *   **t_astronaut** ≈ 163,002.1 years / 1961.16 ≈ 83.1 years\n\nThe calculation shows that while over 163,000 years would pass on Earth, the journey for the 22-year-old astronaut would take approximately 83.1 years from their point of view. Since the astronaut's average lifespan is 150 years, they would be about 22 + 83.1 = 105.1 years old upon arrival, well within their lifetime.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 81 years\nB) 72 years\nC) 77 years\nD) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.\n\nThe calculated time of approximately 83 years is closest to 81 years. The slight difference can be attributed to using a more precise distance to the LMC (like 161,663.4 light-years) which would yield a result of about 82.4 years, or minor rounding in the provided options. Given the choices, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
