    "### Analysis of the System\n\n1.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels**: For a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by E_n = n² * E, where E = π²ħ² / (2mL²) and n is a positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level 'n' and its spin orientation (up or down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of Energy States\n\n*   **Ground State Energy**:\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first.\n    *   The n=1 level can hold two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n    *   The remaining two particles will occupy the next lowest energy level, n=2. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 8E.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum of these energies: 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy**:\n    The first excited state is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the particles occupy the n=1 and n=2 levels. The highest occupied level is n=2.\n    *   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 results in the following configuration: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy for this state is: (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **Second Excited State Energy**:\n    To find the second excited state, we must identify the next possible energy configuration above the first excited state. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n    1.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3: This gives the first excited state with energy 15E.\n    2.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3: The configuration is one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy is (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    3.  Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3: The configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy is (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    4.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4: The configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy is (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest is **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the system are:\n*   **Ground State**: 10E\n*   **First Excited State**: 15E\n*   **Second Excited State**: 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
