    "To calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable *P* will yield the eigenvalue 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the State Vector and the Observable:**\n    The state of the system at time *t* is given by the column vector *ψ*:\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    ψ = $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    </div>\n    The observable *P* is represented by the matrix:\n    <div align=\"center\">\n     P = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    </div>\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector *v* that corresponds to the eigenvalue λ = 0. This is done by solving the eigenvalue equation *Pv* = λ*v*, which for λ = 0 becomes *Pv* = 0.\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}$ = 0 $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}$ = $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    </div>\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of linear equations:\n    *   (1/√2)*y = 0  ⇒  y = 0\n    *   (1/√2)*x + (1/√2)*z = 0  ⇒  x + z = 0  ⇒  x = -z\n\n    From these equations, we can describe the eigenvector *v₀* for the eigenvalue 0. If we let *z* = -1, then *x* = 1.\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    v₀ = $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    </div>\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    According to the Born rule, the probability *Prob(λ)* of measuring an eigenvalue λ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector *ψ* onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector. The general formula is:\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    Prob(λ) = $\\frac{|\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle|^2}{\\langle v | v \\rangle \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle}$\n    </div>\n    Where:\n    *   ⟨*v*|*ψ*⟩ is the inner product (or dot product) of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n    *   ⟨*v*|*v*⟩ and ⟨*ψ*|*ψ*⟩ are the squared norms of the vectors.\n\n    First, let's calculate the necessary inner products:\n    *   **⟨*v₀*|*ψ*⟩**: (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2\n    *   **⟨*v₀*|*v₀*⟩**: (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   **⟨*ψ*|*ψ*⟩**: (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the probability formula:\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    Prob(0) = $\\frac{|-2|^2}{(2)(6)}$ = $\\frac{4}{12}$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n    </div>\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time *t* is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
