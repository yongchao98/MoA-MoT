    "A consistent set of reactants and products can be deduced from the reaction descriptions.\n\n*   **Gases B and D, and Solvent H**: The reaction `D + B -> H` in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, along with the hydrolysis information, strongly suggests a system based on nitrogen oxides.\n    *   Let gas **B** and gas **D** both be nitrogen dioxide, **NO₂**.\n    *   Two molecules of NO₂ exist in equilibrium with dinitrogen tetroxide, N₂O₄. The reaction is 2NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₄(g). N₂O₄ can be a colorless liquid/gas and is used as a solvent. Thus, **H** is **N₂O₄**.\n\n*   **Acids F and G**: The hydrolysis of gas B (NO₂) produces two acids.\n    *   The reaction is `2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) -> HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq)`.\n    *   Nitric acid (HNO₃) is a strong acid (**F**), and nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a weak acid (**G**). This perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Solid A and Product C**: With the identities of B, F, and G established, we can analyze the remaining reactions.\n    *   `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)` becomes `A(s) + 8NO₂(g) -> C (bright red)`.\n    *   `C + H₂O -> A + F + G` becomes `C + H₂O -> A + HNO₃ + HNO₂`. This confirms that the hydrolysis of the ligands from C (which are adducts of NO₂) regenerates the solid A. C is therefore an adduct of A and NO₂, likely A•8NO₂. The \"bright red\" description points towards a complex, possibly of a transition metal, though its specific identity is not needed to find E. Mercury(II) oxide is an example of a red solid involved in decomposition reactions.\n\n*   **Hazardous Product E**: The final reaction is `C + 2D -> E`.\n    *   This becomes `C + 2NO₂(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Since B and D are the same (NO₂), this is `C + 2B -> E`. The hazardous product E is formed by the reaction of the red complex C with more nitrogen dioxide. Given the context of xenon chemistry being famously hazardous and having distinct molecular geometries, a plausible, though not directly derivable, candidate for E is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**. Xenon compounds are known for their hazardous nature as powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agents.\n    *   Assuming E is XeF₄, we can determine its molecular symmetry. XeF₄ has a square planar geometry. It possesses a principal C₄ rotation axis, perpendicular C₂ axes, a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), and vertical and dihedral mirror planes. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **D₄h point group**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
