    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its distance from the star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂) / sqrt(a₁) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n**3. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) allows us to find the star's radial velocity amplitude (K), which is caused by the orbiting planet.\n\nΔλ / λ₀ = K / c  =>  K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere:\n*   K = Radial velocity amplitude\n*   c = Speed of light\n*   Δλ = Doppler shift\n*   λ₀ = Rest wavelength of the spectral line\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude (K) for a star in a circular orbit is also given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p = Planet's mass\n*   M_star = Star's mass\n*   G = Gravitational constant\n*   a = Semi-major axis\n\n**4. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a) = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (M_p₂² * G) / (K₂² * M_star) ] / [ (M_p₁² * G) / (K₁² * M_star) ]\n\nThe terms for G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Plug in the Given Values**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    *   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n    *   M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n    *   K is proportional to Δλ (since c and λ₀ are constant).\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Calculate a₂ / a₁:**\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nNow substitute the value of (a₂ / a₁) back into the temperature ratio formula:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
