    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state:** n = 0, $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** n = 1, $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** n = 2, $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** n = 3, $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy) is given by the formula:\n\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
