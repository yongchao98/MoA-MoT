    "To determine the correct transition route and corresponding probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nIn the non-relativistic theory of the hydrogen atom, transitions between states are governed by selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, can be $0, \\pm 1$.\n*   There is no selection rule for the principal quantum number, $n$, but for spontaneous decay, the atom must transition to a state of lower energy ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Transition Cascade\n\nThe process involves a two-step decay from $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying Selection Rules:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The initial state is an *s*-orbital, so it must transition to a *p*-orbital.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   $n' < 3$. For a two-step cascade to the $n=1$ state, the most probable intermediate state is one with $n=2$.\n*   **Intermediate States:** Based on the rules, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Let's check the validity of the transition from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   **From $|2,1,m'\\rangle$:**\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{intermediate} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{intermediate} = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be one of the values that makes $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This condition holds for all three possibilities: $m'=0 (\\Delta m=0)$, $m'=1 (\\Delta m=-1)$, and $m'=-1 (\\Delta m=+1)$.\n*   Therefore, all three proposed cascades are physically possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability corresponding to a *specific* transition route. We need to find the branching ratio for the first step of the cascade.\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0, m=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n*   Because of this symmetry, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate magnetic sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are found to be equal for $m'=-1, 0, 1$.\n*   Thus, the total probability of 1 is split equally among the three possible decay channels for the first step.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n*   For the second step, the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the 2p level) have only one allowed electric dipole decay channel, which is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s ground state). The transition to the 2s state ($|2,0,0\\rangle$) is forbidden by the parity selection rule ($\\Delta l = -1$ is required, but s to p is allowed, however, p to s is parity changing). Therefore, the probability of the transition from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1 (or 100%).\n\n*   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route specified in options A and D:\n    $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P_{total} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the probability of this specific path occurring is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$\n<<<D>>>"
