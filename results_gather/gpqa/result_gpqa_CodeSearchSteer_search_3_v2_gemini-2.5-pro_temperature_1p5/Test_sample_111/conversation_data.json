    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|α_un>`.\n\n`|α_un> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find the square of its norm, `<α_un|α_un>`, and then divide the state by the square root of this value.\n\n`<α_un|α_un> = |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2`\n`|(1+i)|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`|(2-i)|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5`\n\nThe squared norm is `2 + 5 = 7`. The normalization constant is `1/√7`.\nSo, the normalized state `|α>` is:\n\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix form, using the basis `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i) , (2-i) ]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find Its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. For a 2-state system, this gives the matrix:\n\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli matrix σx. To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = (ħ/2)^2`\n`λ = ± ħ/2`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n\n*   **For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0` gives `[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] * [x, y] = 0`.\n    This leads to the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The corresponding eigenvector is `[1, 1]`.\n    Normalizing it, we get the first eigenstate `|a₁>`:\n    `|a₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0` gives `[[ ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] * [x, y] = 0`.\n    This leads to the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The corresponding eigenvector is `[1, -1]`.\n    Normalizing it, we get the second eigenstate `|a₂>`:\n    `|a₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|a_i>` is given by `P(a_i) = |<a_i|α>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    `<a₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1) * (1+i) + (1) * (2-i) ]`\n    `<a₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/√14|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    `<a₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1) * (1+i) - (1) * (2-i) ]`\n    `<a₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|^2 = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of A is `<A> = <α|A|α>`.\n\n`A|α> = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [ (1+i) , (2-i) ]`\n`A|α> = (ħ / (2√7)) * [ (2-i) , (1+i) ]`\n\nNow, we compute `<α|A|α>`:\n`<α|A|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] * (ħ / (2√7)) * [ (2-i) , (1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<A> = (ħ/14) * 2 = **ħ/7**`\n\nAlternatively, the average value can be calculated using the eigenvalues and probabilities:\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (9ħ/28) - (5ħ/28) = 4ħ/28 = **ħ/7**`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
