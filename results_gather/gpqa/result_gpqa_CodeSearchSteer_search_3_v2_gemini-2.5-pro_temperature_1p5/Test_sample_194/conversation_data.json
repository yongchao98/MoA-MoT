    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we can follow these logical steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transit Geometry**: A planet transits its star when its orbit is viewed nearly edge-on. The impact parameter, `b`, describes how close to the center of the star the planet appears to pass. It's defined as `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the observer, and `R_s` is the star's radius. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their inclination `i` is the same.\n\n2.  **Use Planet 1's Data**: For the first planet, we are given an impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. Using the formula, we have `0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`. This equation links the geometry of the first planet's orbit (`a1`) with the viewing inclination (`i`) and the star's radius (`R_s`). We can rearrange this to `a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`.\n\n3.  **Set the Condition for Planet 2**: For the second planet to transit, its own impact parameter, `b2`, must be less than or equal to 1 (a value of 1 represents a \"grazing\" transit where the planet just skims the edge of the star). To find the *maximum* possible orbital period, we need to find the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`). This occurs at the limit of the transit condition, i.e., when `b2 = 1`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Two Planets**: Using the impact parameter formula for the second planet at its maximum orbital distance, we have `1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s`. This can be rearranged to `a2_max * cos(i) = R_s`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbits**: We now have two expressions involving `cos(i)`:\n    *   From Planet 1: `a1 * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`\n    *   From Planet 2: `a2_max * cos(i) = R_s`\n    By dividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n    `(a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s / (0.2 * R_s)`\n    This simplifies to `a2_max / a1 = 1 / 0.2 = 5`.\n    This means the semi-major axis of the second planet can be at most 5 times that of the first planet. It is important to note that this calculation uses the simplifying and common assumption that the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star's radius for the transit condition.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period**: We can now solve for the maximum period of the second planet, `P2_max`:\n    `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n    Substituting the known values (`P1 = 3` days and `a2_max / a1 = 5`):\n    `P2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = 3 * sqrt(125)`\n    `P2_max ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the star and the second planet were not needed for this calculation, as they cancel out or are handled by the simplifying assumption common in such problems.\n\n<<<B>>>"
