  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the relationship between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### **Analysis of Single Mutants**\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function reduces resistance by 25%. This indicates G1 plays a role in the plant's defense.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This implies that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway. Since the prompt states at least one gene is an upstream transcription factor, G2 is the most likely candidate, acting as a master switch.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function reduces resistance by 50%. This indicates G3 has a more significant role in the pathway than G1.\n\n### **Analysis of Double Mutants (Gene Interactions)**\n\n1.  **Interaction with G2:**\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n\n    When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, it demonstrates **epistasis**. The gene whose phenotype is expressed (in this case, G2) is said to be epistatic to the other gene (G1 and G3). This supports the conclusion that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. If the G2 transcription factor is absent, it doesn't matter whether G1 or G3 are functional because they are not activated.\n\n2.  **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   To analyze this, we compare the double mutant's phenotype to the single mutants. The phenotype is novel and not the same as either the `g1` mutant (75% resistance) or the `g3` mutant (50% resistance). Therefore, neither G1 is epistatic to G3, nor is G3 epistatic to G1 in a simple dominant manner.\n    *   The effect of knocking out both genes is greater than the sum of the effects of knocking them out individually (a 90% loss of resistance compared to individual losses of 25% and 50%). This type of genetic interaction is known as **synergism**. This often occurs when two genes function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome. The term **gene redundancy** is often used in this context, where the genes have partially overlapping functions, and the loss of both is much more severe than the loss of one.\n\n### **Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the given conclusions based on our analysis:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. The data does not support G3 being epistatic to G1; the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance). We also cannot determine if they share a promoter.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor. The term \"gene redundancy\" is a plausible, if broad, description for the synergistic interaction observed between G1 and G3. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G2, not G1, is the clear candidate for the upstream transcription factor due to the 0% resistance phenotype of its knockout.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect for the same reasons as B and C. G1 is not epistatic to G3, and we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits) from this experiment.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be an error in all the options regarding the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3. However, we must choose the best possible answer.\n\n1.  The conclusion that **G2 is a transcription factor** is the most solid finding from the data. This eliminates option C.\n2.  The interaction between G1 and G3 is synergistic, which can be described as a form of **gene redundancy** (parallel pathways). This makes the description in option B the most plausible among the choices.\n3.  Options A, B, and D all make an incorrect statement about epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\nGiven that Option B correctly identifies the upstream gene (G2) and uses the most fitting term for the G1-G3 interaction (\"gene redundancy\") out of all available choices, it stands as the \"best fit\" despite its flawed final clause.\n\n<<<B>>>"
