    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. A point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` induces a charge distribution on the sphere's surface. The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an image charge, `q'`, located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center to `q`.\n\nThe values for the image charge and its position are:\n*   Image charge: `q' = -q(R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R²/d`\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\nAlternatively, and more directly, the potential energy `U` of the configuration is half the product of the real charge `q` and the potential at its location created by the induced charges. The potential from the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  **Potential at the location of q due to the image charge:**\n    The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The potential `V_image` at the location of `q` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R²/d)]`\n    `V_image = -k * q * (R/d) / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n    `V_image = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy of the system:**\n    The total potential energy `U` is given by `(1/2) * q * V_image`. The factor of 1/2 is included because the induced charge builds up as the real charge is brought in from infinity.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * d / (d² + R²)`\nB) `U = -k * q² * d / (d² - R²)`\nC) `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\nD) `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R² / (d² - R²)`\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
