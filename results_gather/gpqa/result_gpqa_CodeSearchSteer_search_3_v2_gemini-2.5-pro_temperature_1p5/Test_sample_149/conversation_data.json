    "The final product is correctly identified through a three-step chemical analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound\n\nThe molecular formula of the initial compound is C8H9NO. The provided ¹H-NMR data is analyzed to determine its structure:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to two protons strongly suggests a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**, which is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a series of reactions:\n\n1.  **NaNO₂, HCl:** This mixture forms nitrous acid (HNO₂) in situ. It reacts with the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) in a process called diazotization to form a diazonium salt. The product of this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water and gentle warming leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This converts the molecule into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The resulting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is then treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. This sets up the conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n### Step 3: The Aldol Condensation\n\nIn the presence of a strong base (KOH), an alpha-proton from the -CH2- group of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is removed to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n*   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions is a strong indicator that the reaction does not stop at the addition stage. The β-hydroxy aldehyde readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. An α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is formed.\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound has a double bond between the second and third carbons, conjugated with both the aldehyde group and one of the hydroxyphenyl rings.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
