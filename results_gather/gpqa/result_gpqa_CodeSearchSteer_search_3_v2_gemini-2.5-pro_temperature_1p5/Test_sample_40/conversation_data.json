    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass block (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured from within the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u'`. This is determined by the index of refraction `n`. The formula is `u' = c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The goal is to find the speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). We'll call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    Now, substitute the values from this problem into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, which is `n`.\n    *   **Numerator:** `1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   **Denominator:** `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, divide the new numerator by the new denominator:\n    `u = ((1 + n*v) / n) / ((n + v) / n)`\n\n    The `n` terms in the denominators cancel each other out, leaving:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result correctly describes the speed of light in a moving medium as observed from a stationary laboratory frame, an effect first observed in the Fizeau experiment and later explained by Einstein's theory of special relativity. The derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
