  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "A detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the reason for the failed protein overexpression.\n\nThe DNA sequence begins with an `ATG` start codon, which is correct. This is followed by the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, which translates to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This corresponds to the standard single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant, an epitope tag commonly used for protein purification and detection. Therefore, the tag sequence itself is correct.\n\nHowever, immediately following the HA tag sequence is the trinucleotide `TGA`. The sequence can be read in codons as:\n5' `ATG` `TAC` `CCA` `TAC` `GAT` `GTT` `CCA` `GAT` `TAC` `GCC` `AAA` `TGA`... 3'\n\nIn the genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon (also called a termination or nonsense codon). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon during translation, it recruits release factors that cause the disassembly of the ribosomal complex and the release of the newly synthesized, and in this case, incomplete, polypeptide chain. The presence of this \"premature\" stop codon causes translation to halt immediately after the HA tag is synthesized, preventing the translation of the downstream GADD45G coding sequence. This premature termination of translation is the direct cause of the inability to express the full-length recombinant protein.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out:\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As analyzed, the HA tag sequence correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide and is free of mutations.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be beneficial, their absence is not the primary issue here. The protein is not being fully synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon, so subsequent proteolysis is not the cause of the expression failure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
