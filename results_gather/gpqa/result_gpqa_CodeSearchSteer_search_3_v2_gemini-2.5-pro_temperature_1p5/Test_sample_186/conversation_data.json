    "An analysis of the six specified celestial objects reveals that three would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph under the given conditions. A star is considered detectable if it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour exposure using a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT) and is within the observable range of the Paranal Observatory.\n\nThe key performance benchmark for ESPRESSO in its single telescope (1-UT) mode indicates it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 for a star with an apparent V magnitude of 17.1 in a one-hour exposure (three 20-minute exposures). Therefore, any star with an apparent V magnitude (m_v) of 17.1 or brighter (i.e., a smaller magnitude value) is considered detectable.\n\nAdditionally, the star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile. The observatory's southern latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees limits its view of the northern sky. Stars with a declination significantly above +65 degrees are not visible from this location.\n\nHere is a star-by-star evaluation:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** With an apparent magnitude of approximately -0.74 and a declination of about -52°, Canopus is exceptionally bright and ideally positioned for observation from Paranal. It is therefore **detectable**.\n*   **b) Polaris:** The North Star has a very high northern declination of about +89°, which places it permanently below the horizon for the VLT at Paranal. Consequently, it is **not detectable**.\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** A star with an absolute magnitude (Mv) of 15 at a distance (d) of 10 parsecs has an apparent magnitude (m_v) of 15.0, calculated using the distance modulus formula `(m_v = M_v - 5 + 5*log10(d))`. Its declination of 0° makes it observable. Since its magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the 17.1 limit, it is **detectable**.\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** This star, with an absolute magnitude of 15, would have an apparent magnitude of 21.5. This is significantly fainter than the detection limit of 17.1. Thus, it is **not detectable**.\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** This star, with an absolute magnitude of 15, would have a calculated apparent magnitude of approximately 13.5. Being brighter than the 17.1 limit and at an observable declination, it is **detectable**.\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** With an absolute magnitude of 15, this star's apparent magnitude calculates to approximately 18.5. This is fainter than the instrument's limit under the specified conditions, making it **not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, three stars—Canopus, the hypothetical star at 10 parsecs, and the hypothetical star at 5 parsecs—meet the criteria for detection.\n\n<<<C>>>"
