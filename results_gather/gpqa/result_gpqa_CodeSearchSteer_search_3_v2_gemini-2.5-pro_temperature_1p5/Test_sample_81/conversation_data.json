    "The reaction proceeds in three steps, each with important stereochemical consequences.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene was heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio, forming product 1.**\nCyclooctatetraene (COT) exists primarily in a non-planar tub conformation. Upon heating, it enters into an equilibrium with a small amount of its bicyclic valence tautomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer is reactive as a diene in the Diels-Alder reaction. It reacts with maleic anhydride (the dienophile) via its cyclohexadiene moiety. This cycloaddition proceeds with *endo* stereoselectivity, which is typical for such reactions, leading to the thermodynamically favored product. The resulting product (Product 1) is a complex tetracyclic anhydride, where the anhydride group has a specific *cis-endo* orientation.\n\n**Step 2: 1 was heated with methanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the acid-catalyzed methanolysis of the anhydride ring in Product 1. The anhydride is opened to form two methyl ester groups. This reaction does not change the stereocenters of the carbon skeleton, and the two newly formed ester groups maintain their *cis* relationship to each other, preserving the stereochemistry established in the first step.\n\n**Step 3: 2 was heated with cyclopentadiene, forming final product 3.**\nThis is a second Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Dienophile:** Product 2. The double bond in the strained four-membered (cyclobutene) ring of Product 2 is a reactive dienophile.\n*   **Diene:** Cyclopentadiene.\n\nThe cyclopentadiene will add across the cyclobutene double bond. The stereochemical outcome is determined by two factors:\n1.  **Facial Selectivity:** The diene will approach the dienophile from the less sterically hindered face. The existing cage-like structure of Product 2 blocks one face, so cyclopentadiene adds to the opposite (*exo*) face.\n2.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity of the second Diels-Alder:** The addition of cyclopentadiene itself follows the *endo rule*, which dictates the orientation of the cyclopentadiene ring as it adds to the dienophile.\n\nThis sequence of two highly stereoselective Diels-Alder reactions results in the formation of a single major diastereomer (as a racemic mixture, since all starting materials are achiral). The provided options describe different stereoisomers. Based on the established stereochemical rules for this reaction sequence, the specific set of relative stereocenters corresponds to the structure given in option A.\n\nThe correct structure for the major isomer is therefore:\n**name: dimethyl (1R,4S,4aR,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate**\n**SMILES: O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@H]2[C@@H]1C(OC)=O**\n\n<<<A>>>"
