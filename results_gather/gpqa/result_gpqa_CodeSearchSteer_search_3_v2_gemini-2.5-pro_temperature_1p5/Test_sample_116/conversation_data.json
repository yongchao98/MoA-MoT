    "Which of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound exhibits a form of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and ester groups) at all four ortho-positions of the biphenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, combined with an appropriate substitution pattern, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, making it chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a chiral center. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** This molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
