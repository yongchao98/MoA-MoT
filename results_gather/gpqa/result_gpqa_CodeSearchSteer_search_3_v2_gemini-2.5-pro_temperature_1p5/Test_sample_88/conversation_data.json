    "The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, formed through a three-step reaction sequence starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Product 1**\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. While the provided ¹H NMR data for product 1 is unusual, the reaction of halo-adamantanes under basic conditions is known to cause skeletal rearrangements. A common and chemically sound transformation under these conditions is the formation of protoadamantanone. The given IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a ketone, and the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O is what would be expected from the replacement of two bromine atoms with one oxygen atom. Therefore, Product 1 is identified as **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one).\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. So, the ketone is first reduced to the corresponding alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene. The formation of an alkene can be explained by an *in-situ* dehydration of the intermediate alcohol, a reaction plausible under heating. The elimination of water from protoadamantan-4-ol would preferentially form the more stable alkene, which is **protoadamant-4-ene**, as the formation of a double bond to the bridgehead position is disfavored (Bredt's rule).\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the double bond and converts the two alkene carbons into carbonyl groups. In protoadamant-4-ene, the double bond is between two CH groups, so the cleavage results in two aldehyde (CHO) groups. This reaction opens one of the rings of the protoadamantane skeleton, yielding **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde (excluding the aldehyde protons, as per the question).\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the most deshielded non-aldehyde protons are those on the carbons bearing the aldehyde groups, i.e., H3 and H7. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Conformation and Coupling:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane systems typically adopt a chair-chair conformation. With the bulky aldehyde groups occupying the equatorial positions to minimize steric hindrance, the H3 proton will be in an axial position.\n*   **Neighboring Protons:** The H3 proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are CH₂ groups. Thus, H3 is coupled to four neighboring protons.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** In the chair conformation, the four neighboring protons are not equivalent. H3 (axial) couples differently to the axial and equatorial protons on C2 and C4.\n    *   It experiences a large axial-axial (Jₐₐ) coupling with the two axial protons (H2-ax and H4-ax).\n    *   It experiences a small axial-equatorial (Jₐₑ) coupling with the two equatorial protons (H2-eq and H4-eq).\n\nThe signal for H3 is first split into a triplet by the two axial protons (with coupling constant Jₐₐ). Each line of this triplet is then further split into another triplet by the two equatorial protons (with the smaller coupling constant Jₐₑ). The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
