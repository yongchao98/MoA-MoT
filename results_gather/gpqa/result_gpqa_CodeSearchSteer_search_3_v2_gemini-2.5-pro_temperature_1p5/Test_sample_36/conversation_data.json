    "The analysis of the reaction series is as follows:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to protect the aldehyde group, forming a 1,3-dithiolane. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic proton at the C-2 position (between the two sulfur atoms) of the dithiolane ring. This creates a stabilized carbanion, B, which is a lithiated 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C-2 position. The resulting product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n4.  **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**: This step is the deprotection of the dithioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group. The product, D, is diethyl ketone (3-pentanone), which has the structure CH3CH2COCH2CH3.\n5.  **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is prepared from 3-bromopentane and triphenylphosphine (PPh3), followed by deprotonation with BuLi. This forms the ylide: (CH3CH2)2C=PPh3.\n    *   Next, the ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, with the structure (CH3CH2)2C=C(CH2CH3)2.\n\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene). The molecule is highly symmetrical around the central carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH3-CH2 \\     / CH2-CH3\n               C = C\n      CH3-CH2 /     \\ CH2-CH3\n```\n\nDue to this symmetry, we can identify the chemically equivalent carbons:\n*   The two carbons of the central C=C double bond are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n*   All four methylene (-CH2-) groups of the ethyl substituents are equivalent. This gives a second signal.\n*   All four methyl (-CH3) groups of the ethyl substituents are equivalent. This gives a third signal.\n\nTherefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the highly symmetrical product E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, will show a total of 3 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
