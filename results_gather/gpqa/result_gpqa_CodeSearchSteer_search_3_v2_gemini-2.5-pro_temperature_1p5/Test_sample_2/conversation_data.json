    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in their matrix representations.\n\nThe given state of the spin-half particle is:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn the standard basis where |↑⟩ is the spin-up state and |↓⟩ is the spin-down state, their vector representations are:\n*   |↑⟩ =ᵀ\n*   |↓⟩ =ᵀ\n\nSo, the state vector |ψ⟩ can be written as:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/2)ᵀ + (√3)/2ᵀ = [1/2, √3/2]ᵀ\n\nThe operator for which we want to find the expectation value is `O = 10σz + 5σx`. The Pauli matrices σz and σx are defined as:\n*   σz = [, [0, -1]]\n*   σx = [,]\n\nThe expectation value, ⟨O⟩, is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. This can be broken down due to the linearity of the operator:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of σz:\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩\nThe action of σz on the basis states is σz|↑⟩ = |↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.\n⟨σz⟩ = (1/2)² * (1) + ((√3)/2)² * (-1) = 1/4 - 3/4 = -2/4 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σx:\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\nThe action of σx on the basis states is σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\n*   σx|ψ⟩ = σx( (1/2)|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩ ) = (1/2)|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩\n*   ⟨σx⟩ = [ (1/2)⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓| ] * [ (√3)/2|↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓⟩ ]\n*   Using the orthogonality of the states (⟨↑|↓⟩=0, ⟨↑|↑⟩=1, ⟨↓|↓⟩=1), this simplifies to:\n*   ⟨σx⟩ = (1/2)*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(1/2) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we combine these results to find the total expectation value:\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
