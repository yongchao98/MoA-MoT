    "Here is a step-by-p-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A peak at **m/z = 158** is observed with an intensity that is 32% of the M⁺ peak. This M⁺/ (M+2) ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** All the proposed structures (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) share the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂. The calculated molecular weight for this formula, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl, ¹⁶O), is 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\nThe mass spectrum confirms that the molecule has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and contains one chlorine atom, but it does not distinguish between the four isomers.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is indicative of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nThis IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride/ester and would lack the broad O-H peak, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (B), which is an aldehyde with a phenolic -OH. The IR of a phenolic -OH is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid. This narrows the possibilities down to the two carboxylic acid isomers: 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (D).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) which is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive evidence of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). This further confirms that the unknown is either 2- or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n\nThis pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each accounting for two protons, indicates a high degree of symmetry in the benzene ring. Specifically, it points to a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are chemically equivalent, as are the protons at positions 3 and 5. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing two protons.\n\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **(C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a more complex spectrum with four separate signals (or complex multiplets), each integrating to one proton. The ¹H NMR spectrum for 2-chlorobenzoic acid shows four distinct signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **(D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted. Due to the plane of symmetry through carbons 1 and 4, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent. This would produce exactly the pattern observed: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Published spectra for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirm this pattern.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is identified as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **MS** established the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identified the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** determined the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring to be para (1,4).\n\n<<<D>>>"
