    "The problem requires an application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states. For a given element in a stellar photosphere, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_a) is given by:\n\n(N_b / N_a) = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of excited to lower-state atoms for a specific energy transition as `R`.\n\nFor Star 1, with temperature T_1:\nR_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor Star 2, with temperature T_2:\nR_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in Star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in Star 2. This means that the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state is twice as large for Star 1 compared to Star 2. Therefore:\n\nR_1 / R_2 = 2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions for R_1 and R_2:\n\n[ (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] ] / [ (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ] = 2\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\nexp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nNow, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is:\n\n(1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation gives the final result:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
