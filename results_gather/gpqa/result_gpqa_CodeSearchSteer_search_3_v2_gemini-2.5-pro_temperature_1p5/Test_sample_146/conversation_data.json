    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n*   The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its initial kinetic energy as zero.\n*   Assuming the proton is at rest in the lab frame, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. A proton and an antiproton have identical masses.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n*   The annihilation results in four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n*   All four resulting particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   According to the principle of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n*   The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n    *   Rest energy of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938 MeV.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   Rest energy of one particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n    *   The total energy of one A particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Since momentum is conserved, the four particles must be produced with equal kinetic energy. Thus, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\n**4. Calculation**\n*   First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    *   $1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n*   Next, use the formula for the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity ($v$). Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n*   The calculated velocity $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
