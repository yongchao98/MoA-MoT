    "The selection of reagents is based on established organic chemistry reactions: cyanohydrin formation and nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition to a ketone, specifically a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophile is the cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN. The CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This initially forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this intermediate must be protonated to form the hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). An acidic medium, represented by H₃O⁺, provides these protons. Often, this is achieved by generating HCN *in situ* by adding a strong acid to the cyanide salt solution.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of nitriles can be catalyzed by either an acid or a base, typically by heating under reflux. The question specifies that reagent B is used with water (H₂O). For acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, a strong acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid is used. The strong acid protonates the nitrile, which increases its electrophilicity and makes it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. Following the initial attack and subsequent steps, an amide intermediate is formed, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Given the options, HCl is a strong acid and a standard reagent for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Reagent A is H₃O⁺ for the protonation step in cyanohydrin formation.\n*   Reagent B is HCl for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
