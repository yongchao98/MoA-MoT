    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    Initially, the spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the z-direction, S_z. We'll assume it's the \"spin up\" state, denoted as `|+z⟩`. The magnetic moment is given by **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin vector operator.\n\n2.  **Define the Hamiltonian:**\n    The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system describes the interaction energy between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, given by H = -**μ** · **B**.\n    With the magnetic field **B** = B**ŷ** (where **ŷ** is the unit vector in the Y direction), the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = -γ(S_x **x̂** + S_y **ŷ** + S_z **ẑ**) · (B **ŷ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle `|ψ(t)⟩` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`\n    where `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n    We can calculate the exponential of the Hamiltonian operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix.\n    H = -γB(ħ/2)σ_y.\n    The time evolution operator is `U(t) = exp[-i(-γB(ħ/2)σ_y)t/ħ] = exp[i(γBt/2)σ_y]`.\n\n    Using the identity for Pauli matrices, `exp(iθn·σ) = cos(θ)I + isin(θ)n·σ`, where **n** is a unit vector. Here, θ = γBt/2 and **n** is the y-direction vector **ŷ**.\n    `U(t) = cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y`.\n\n    The initial state `|+z⟩` is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`. Applying the evolution operator:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(γBt/2)I + isin(γBt/2)σ_y] [[1], [0]]`\n    Since σ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`, this becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] [[1], [0]]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n\n    This is the state of the particle at time `t`. In the `|+z⟩`, `|-z⟩` basis, it is:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. We need to calculate `⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩`.\n    The S_z operator is `(ħ/2)σ_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n    `⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩ = (γħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n    This expression describes an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω`. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt)`. By comparing, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n    ω = γB.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The projection of this precessing spin vector onto the Z-axis oscillates with this same frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
