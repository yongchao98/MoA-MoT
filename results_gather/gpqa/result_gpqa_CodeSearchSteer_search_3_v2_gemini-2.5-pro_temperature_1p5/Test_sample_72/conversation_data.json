    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, as their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) of two objects (A and B) moving in the same direction is:\n\n**v_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A * v_B) / c²)**\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v_A) = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v_B) = 0.5c\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\n*   **v_rel ≈ 0.1428c**\n\nThis rounds to **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The formula for the total relativistic energy of a single particle is:\n\n**E = γmc²**\n\nwhere:\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor, calculated as **γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**.\n*   **m** is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass = 2m, velocity = 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √0.64\n*   γ₁ = 1 / 0.8\n*   **γ₁ = 1.25**\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₁) of the first astronaut:\n*   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c²\n*   E₁ = 1.25 * 2m * c²\n*   **E₁ = 2.5mc²**\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass = 3m, velocity = 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √0.75\n*   γ₂ ≈ 1 / 0.866\n*   **γ₂ ≈ 1.1547**\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₂) of the second astronaut:\n*   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c²\n*   E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c²\n*   **E₂ ≈ 3.4641mc²**\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.9641mc²**\n\nThis rounds to **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
