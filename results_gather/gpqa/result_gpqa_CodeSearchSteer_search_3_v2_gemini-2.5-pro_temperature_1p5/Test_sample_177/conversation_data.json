    "To determine the mass dimension of Îº and the renormalizability of the theory defined by the interaction Lagrangian \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\), we must analyze the mass dimensions of each component of the term.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimensions of Fields and the Lagrangian:**\n    In 4-dimensional spacetime and using natural units where \\(c=\\hbar=1\\), the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}\\) is dimensionless. Since \\([d^4x] = M^{-4}\\) (where M stands for mass), the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of \\(M^4\\).\n\n    The components of the interaction Lagrangian are:\n    *   **Fermion fields (\\(\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}\\)):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is \\(\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have \\([\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = 4\\). Since \\([\\partial_\\mu] = M^1\\) and \\([\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}]\\), it follows that \\(2[\\psi] + 1 = 4\\), which gives the mass dimension of a fermion field as \\([\\psi] = M^{3/2}\\).\n    *   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (\\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\)):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have \\(2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4\\), which means \\([F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2\\).\n    *   **Sigma matrix (\\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\)):** This is defined as \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]\\). The gamma matrices, \\(\\gamma_\\mu\\), are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (\\(\\kappa\\)):**\n    The interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) must have the same mass dimension as the full Lagrangian, which is \\(M^4\\).\n    The dimension of the interaction term is the sum of the dimensions of its parts:\n    \\([\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4\\)\n\n    Substituting the known dimensions:\n    \\([\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4\\)\n    \\([\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4\\)\n    \\([\\kappa] + 5 = 4\\)\n    \\([\\kappa] = -1\\)\n\n    So, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n3.  **Renormalizability of the Theory:**\n    The renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constant(s).\n    *   If the coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension (\\([g] > 0\\)), the theory is super-renormalizable.\n    *   If the coupling constant is **dimensionless** (\\([g] = 0\\)), the theory is renormalizable.\n    *   If the coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension (\\([g] < 0\\)), the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n    Since the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. In non-renormalizable theories, divergences in loop calculations become progressively worse at higher orders of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel them, which strips the theory of its predictive power.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
