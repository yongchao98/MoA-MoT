    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products is determined by the different pathways the reaction can take.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base that can remove a proton (or deuteron) from a position adjacent (ortho) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n1.  **Removal of Deuterium (D) from C2:** The amide ion can remove the deuterium atom at the C2 position.\n2.  **Removal of Hydrogen (H) from C6:** The amide ion can also remove the hydrogen atom at the C6 position.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking the weaker C-H bond is faster than breaking the stronger C-D bond. However, both eliminations occur, leading to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n*   **Benzyne A (from D removal):** This intermediate has no deuterium and possesses a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **Benzyne B (from H removal):** This intermediate still contains the deuterium atom at C2, with the triple bond located between C1 and C6.\n\n**Step 2: Addition and Formation of Final Products**\n\nThe nucleophile in the reaction, the amide ion (NH2-), attacks the highly reactive benzyne intermediates. This can happen at either carbon of the triple bond.\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne A:** Attack by the amide ion at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, leads to the formation of a single product:\n    *   **Product 1: Aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n*   **Reaction of Benzyne B (3-deuterobenzyne):** This deuterated intermediate can be attacked at two different positions:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amide ion adds to C1. Subsequent protonation yields **2-deuterioaniline** (ortho-deuterioaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amide ion adds to C6. Subsequent protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline** (meta-deuterioaniline).\n\nIn total, the reaction produces three different organic molecules: aniline, 2-deuterioaniline, and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
