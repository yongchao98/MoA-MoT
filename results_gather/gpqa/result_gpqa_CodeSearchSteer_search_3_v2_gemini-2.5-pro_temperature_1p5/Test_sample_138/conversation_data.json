    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for the synthesis of α-diketones (also called 1,2-diketones). The reaction proceeds by converting the starting ketone into its enol or enolate form, which then reacts with the nitrosonium ion (NO+) generated from NaNO2 and HCl. This initially forms an α-nitroso ketone, which tautomerizes to an oxime. Subsequent hydrolysis of the oxime under the acidic aqueous conditions yields the final α-diketone product. For this reaction to occur, the starting ketone must have a methylene (-CH2-) or methine (-CH-) group adjacent (in the α-position) to the carbonyl group.\n\n**Reaction A: A + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is an α-diketone. The starting material A must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the carbon next to the existing carbonyl group.\n*   **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one** is a suitable starting material. It has a carbonyl group at position 1 and methylene groups at positions 2 and 6. The reaction with NaNO2/HCl will oxidize one of these adjacent methylene groups (e.g., at C-2) to a second carbonyl group, yielding the desired 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n*   4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol is an alcohol, not a ketone, and would not undergo this specific transformation.\n*   4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-diol is a diol, and its oxidation to a diketone typically requires different oxidizing agents.\n\n**Reaction B: B + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe product is also an α-diketone. The starting material B must be a ketone with an oxidizable α-position.\n*   **5-methylhexan-2-one** fits this requirement. Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. The carbonyl group is at C-2, and there is a methylene group (-CH2-) at the adjacent C-3 position. Treatment with NaNO2/HCl will oxidize this methylene group to a carbonyl group, forming the product 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   5-methylhexane-2,3-diol is a diol and is not the correct starting material for this reaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct starting materials are A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one and B = 5-methylhexan-2-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
