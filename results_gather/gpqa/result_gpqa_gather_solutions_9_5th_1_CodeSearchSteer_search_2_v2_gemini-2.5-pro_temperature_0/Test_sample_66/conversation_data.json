The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This quantum number corresponds to the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. This is expressed as a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a projection from a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ to be possible (i.e., have a non-zero probability), this condition must be met.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We then compare these two values: Is $m = m_1 + m_2$? The check fails, as $-1 \\neq -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. This means the desired final state is physically impossible to obtain from the given initial state, as it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The probability of such a forbidden event is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is designed to test the understanding of the relationship between the initial state, given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), and the measurement outcome, which is defined in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$).\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict conservation law. If it is violated, the probability is not just small, it is exactly zero. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view the problem is to recognize that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, corresponding to $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The values for the total angular momentum ($l=2$) and the individual angular momenta ($l_1=1, l_2=1$) are not needed to determine that the probability is zero. The entire problem is solved by considering only the magnetic quantum numbers $m, m_1,$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The physical analysis unanimously concludes that the probability is 0.

This corresponds to finding the system in an *uncoupled* state where:\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the first electron is **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the second electron is **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law**: A core principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This physical law leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Comparing the two values, we find that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$). The selection rule is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible for a system in the given initial state, as it would violate a fundamental conservation law. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem is designed to test the understanding of the relationship between the initial state, given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), and the measurement outcome, which is defined in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$).

The desired final state, corresponding to $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a *different* eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Ignoring Irrelevant Information**: The values of the total angular momentum quantum number ($l=2$) and the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers ($l_1=1, l_2=1$) are not needed to determine that this specific probability is zero.

All the provided candidate answers correctly identify the core physical principle, which is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. I will synthesize this common, correct reasoning into a clear, step-by-step explanation.\n\nMy step-by-step process will be:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: I will identify the quantum numbers of the initial state ($|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$) and the desired final state after measurement ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$).\n2.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: The key to this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, which dictates the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: I will check if the selection rule is satisfied. If it is violated, the probability of the event is exactly zero.\n4.  **List Careful Points**: I will summarize the crucial concepts, such as the difference between coupled and uncoupled bases, the absolute nature of the selection rule, and the orthogonality of eigenstates, which provides an alternative perspective.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that formalizes this logical deduction. The script will define the quantum numbers, apply the selection rule, determine the probability, and select the correct option from the list provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial quantum number here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Governing Principle**: In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momentum follows a strict conservation law for the z-component. This is expressed by the selection rule:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    A measurement is only possible if the sum of the individual measured quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$) equals the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the initial state.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check**:\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement, the sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the two, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The selection rule is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible. The initial state is orthogonal to the state we want to measure. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The problem tests the understanding of the relationship between the initial state, given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), and the measurement outcome, described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$).\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute**: The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict conservation law, not an approximation. If it is violated, the probability is not just small; it is exactly zero. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting these two states is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: An alternative view is that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, corresponding to $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.

The most critical piece of information for this problem is the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum, which is **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Governing Physical Principle:**\n    The core principle that connects the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$) is the **conservation of the z-component of angular momentum**. The operator for the total z-component is the sum of the individual operators, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship leads to a strict and absolute selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state according to this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the two values, we find that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$).

If it is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states is exactly zero, and thus the probability is zero. No further calculation is necessary.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative, more formal way to understand this is to recognize that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, corresponding to the uncoupled state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a *different* eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. A fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Ignoring Irrelevant Information:** The values $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, and $l=2$ are necessary to define the state but are not directly used in the calculation.

All the provided candidate answers correctly identify the core physical principle, which is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. I will synthesize this common, correct reasoning into a clear, step-by-step explanation.\n\nMy step-by-step process will be:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: I will identify the quantum numbers of the initial state ($|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$) and the desired final state after measurement ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$).\n2.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: The key to this problem is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, which dictates the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: I will check if the selection rule is satisfied.

The crucial quantum number here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Desired Measurement Outcome**: The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.

The desired final state, corresponding to $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. A fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Irrelevance of Other Quantum Numbers**: For this specific question, the values of $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, and $l=2$ are not needed to determine the probability. The entire problem hinges on the relationship between $m$, $m_1$, and $m_2$.\n*   **Mapping to Options**: The physical analysis unanimously concludes that the probability is 0.

The value 0 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:** The system of two electrons is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This quantum number corresponds to the z-component of the *total* angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    Therefore, the measurement is asking for the probability of finding the system in the *uncoupled* state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum when adding angular momenta. This is expressed as a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    For a projection from a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ to an uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ to be possible (i.e., have a non-zero probability), this condition must be met.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we calculate the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We then compare these two values: Is $m = m_1 + m_2$? The check fails, as $-1 \\neq -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is violated. This means the desired final state is physically impossible to obtain from the given initial state, as it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The probability of such a forbidden event is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is designed to test the understanding of the relationship between the initial state, given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), and the measurement outcome, which is defined in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The selection rule is the key that connects them.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict conservation law, not an approximation. If it is violated, the probability is not just small, it is exactly zero. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to view the problem is to recognize that the initial state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state, corresponding to $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of a system in one eigenstate being measured in an orthogonal state is zero.\n*   **Ignoring Irrelevant Information:** The values for the total angular momentum ($l=2$) and the individual angular momenta ($l_1=1, l_2=1$) are not needed to determine that the probability is zero. The entire problem is solved by considering only the magnetic quantum numbers $m, m_1,$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The physical analysis unanimously concludes that the probability is 0. Matching this numerical result to the given options (A) 2/3, B) 1, C) 0, D) 1/2), the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and its Properties:** The system of two electrons is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, given by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.

The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the $L_z$ operator with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both individual z-components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in an *uncoupled* state where:\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the first electron is **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   The magnetic quantum number for the second electron is **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Conservation Law:** A core principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This physical law leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state by applying this selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the two values, we find that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$). The selection rule is violated. This means the desired measurement outcome is physically impossible for a system in the given initial state, as it would violate a fundamental conservation law. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is designed to test the understanding of the relationship between the initial state, given in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) where total angular momentum is well-defined, and the measurement outcome, which is described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$) where individual components are well-defined.\n*   **The Selection Rule is Absolute:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a strict conservation law, not an approximation.
