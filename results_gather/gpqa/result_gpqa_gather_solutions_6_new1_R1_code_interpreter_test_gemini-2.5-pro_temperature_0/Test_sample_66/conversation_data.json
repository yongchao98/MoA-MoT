The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state with the sum required by the final state. Since **$-1 \\neq -2$**, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of this measurement outcome is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts with a state in the *coupled basis* ($|l, m\\rangle$), where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and asks about a measurement outcome in the *uncoupled basis* ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where the individual z-components are well-defined. The connection between these bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The `m = m₁ + m₂` Selection Rule is Absolute:** This rule is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is not an approximation. If the rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states is zero by definition, meaning the probability is zero without any further calculation.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to understand this is to recognize that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state to be in another is the square of their inner product, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n\nBased on the analysis, the probability is 0. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, followed by a list of careful points to consider for a robust solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The system of two electrons is described by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The most important piece of information here is the total magnetic quantum number, **m = -1**. This signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of the angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the first electron being **$m_1 = -1$**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the second electron being **$m_2 = -1$**.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Principle of Angular Momentum Addition:** A core principle in quantum mechanics is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. When individual angular momenta are combined, the total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for their corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system according to this conservation law.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number: **$m = -1$**.\n    *   For the desired final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is: **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum required by the final state ($m_1+m_2=-2$). Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, it is a physically impossible event, and its probability is exactly **0**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts with a state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where the total angular momentum is well-defined, and asks about the probability of a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where the individual z-components are well-defined. The connection between these two representations is governed by strict rules.\n*   **The Absoluteness of the Selection Rule:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not an approximation but a direct consequence of the operator relationship $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. If this rule is not satisfied, the probability of finding the system in that state is exactly zero, without needing to calculate any Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** This provides an alternative, powerful way to see the result. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is *also* an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state when the system is in another is the square of their inner product, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n\nBased on the analysis, the probability is 0. This corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this quantum mechanics problem by applying the fundamental principles of angular momentum addition. The core of the problem lies in a conservation law, which acts as a strict selection rule.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State**: I will identify the quantum numbers describing the system from the given coupled state `|l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. The most important number here is the total magnetic quantum number, `m`.\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Final State**: I will determine the individual magnetic quantum numbers, `m1` and `m2`, that correspond to the measurement outcome described in the question.\n3.  **Apply the Conservation Law**: I will use the fundamental selection rule for adding angular momenta, which states that the total magnetic quantum number `m` must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1 + m2`.\n4.  **Check for Consistency**: I will compare the value of `m` from the initial state with the sum `m1 + m2` required by the final state.\n5.  **Determine the Probability**: If the conservation law is violated (i.e., `m != m1 + m2`), the probability of such a measurement is exactly zero.\n6.  **Map to Options**: I will match the calculated probability to the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\nBased on my analysis of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous agreement on the physical principle and the resulting probability of 0. The main source of error among the candidates was incorrectly mapping this result to the provided options. I will ensure this mapping is done correctly.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis**: The initial state `|l, m>` is given in the \"coupled basis,\" where the total angular momentum is well-defined. The measurement outcome `|m1, m2>` is described in the \"uncoupled basis,\" where the individual z-components are well-defined. The connection between these two bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The `m = m1 + m2` Selection Rule**: This is an absolute and exact rule that stems from the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. If this rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states is zero, and thus the probability is zero. No further complex calculation is needed.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: An alternative way to understand the zero probability is to recognize that the initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator `Lz` with eigenvalue `-1ħ`. The desired final state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` is also an eigenstate of `Lz`, but with a different eigenvalue `(-1 + -1)ħ = -2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `Lz`) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one from the other is the square of their inner product, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n\n```python\ndef solve_angular_momentum_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability for a quantum measurement based on the conservation of angular momentum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n    # The system is in the state |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>.\n    # The total magnetic quantum number 'm' is the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n    m_initial = -1\n    print(f\"Step 1: The initial state |1, 1, 2, -1> has a total magnetic quantum number m = {m_initial}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the Desired Final State\n    # The question asks for the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of L_1z as -ħ and L_2z as -ħ.\n    # The eigenvalue of L_z is m_l * ħ.\n    # Therefore, the desired individual magnetic quantum numbers are m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n    m1_measured = -1\n    m2_measured = -1\n    print(f\"Step 2: The desired measurement outcome corresponds to individual quantum numbers m1 = {m1_measured} and m2 = {m2_measured}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the Conservation Law (Selection Rule)\n    # The total magnetic quantum number must be conserved.\n    # m_final = m1 + m2\n    m_sum_final = m1_measured + m2_measured\n    print(f\"Step 3: The sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome is m1 + m2 = {m_sum_final}.\")\n    print(\"Step 4: The selection rule for angular momentum addition requires that m_initial must equal m1 + m2 for the probability to be non-zero.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the Probability\n    probability = 0\n    if m_initial == m_sum_final:\n        # This condition is not met.

The most important piece of information for this problem is the total magnetic quantum number, **`m = -1`**. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator, `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`, and a measurement of `L_z` would yield the eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ` with 100% certainty.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` to be `-ħ`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for the operator `L₁z` corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **`m₁ = -1`**.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for the operator `L₂z` corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **`m₂ = -1`**.\n    This desired final state is an uncoupled basis state represented by `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.

This signifies that the system is in an eigenstate of the total z-component of the angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Desired Measurement Outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the first electron being $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number for the second electron being $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state described by the quantum numbers $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Governing Physical Principle:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must check if the desired measurement outcome is consistent with the initial state of the system by applying the selection rule.\n    *   From the initial state, we have the total magnetic quantum number **m = -1**.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is **$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the values, we see that $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (since $-1 \\neq -2$). The desired measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, it is a physically impossible event, and the probability of it occurring is exactly zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem is set up with an initial state in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$), where the total angular momentum is well-defined. It asks for the probability of a measurement outcome in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$), where the individual z-components are well-defined. The connection between these bases is governed by strict rules.\n*   **The Absoluteness of the Selection Rule:** The rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is a direct consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is not an approximation. If this rule is violated, the probability of the measurement is exactly zero, without the need for any further calculation of coefficients.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** An alternative way to understand this is to recognize that the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue of $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of measuring one state from the other is the square of their inner product, which is zero for orthogonal states.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly applied the physical principles and unanimously concluded that the probability is 0. The discrepancies in their final letter choices arose from inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options. Based on the options provided in the prompt (A) 1/2, B) 0, C) 1, D) 2/3), the correct choice for a probability of 0 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The measurement outcome `|m1, m2>` is described in the \"uncoupled basis,\" where the individual z-components are well-defined. The connection between these two bases is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The `m = m1 + m2` Selection Rule**: This is an absolute and exact rule that stems from the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. If this rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states is zero, and thus the probability is zero. No further complex calculation is needed.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates**: An alternative way to understand the zero probability is to recognize that the initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator `Lz` with eigenvalue `-1ħ`. The desired final state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` is also an eigenstate of `Lz`, but with a different eigenvalue `(-1 + -1)ħ = -2ħ`. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like `Lz`) corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal.
