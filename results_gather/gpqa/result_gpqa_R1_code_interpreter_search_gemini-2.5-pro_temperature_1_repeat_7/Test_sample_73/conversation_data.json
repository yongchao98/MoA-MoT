    "This is a problem about conditional probability in the context of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key property of exponential decay is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\n**Step 1: Define the decay law and find the decay constant (λ).**\n\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n`P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability of decay within time `t` is therefore:\n`P(decay, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find `λ`.\n`P(decay, 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nTo solve for `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nLet's calculate the value of `λ`.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given information\nprob_decay_100 = 0.32\ntime_100 = 100\n\n# From the decay formula, P(decay) = 1 - exp(-lambda*t), we have exp(-lambda*t) = 1 - P(decay)\n# So, -lambda*t = ln(1 - P(decay))\n# And lambda = -ln(1 - P(decay)) / t\n\nlambda_val = -math.log(1 - prob_decay_100) / time_100\nprint(f\"The decay constant lambda is: {lambda_val}\")\n\n# Now we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n# given it has survived for 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is simply the\n# probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in next 150 min) = P(decay, 150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\ntime_next = 150\nprob_decay_next_150 = 1 - math.exp(-lambda_val * time_next)\n\n# Convert to percentage\nprob_percentage = prob_decay_next_150 * 100\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {prob_percentage:.2f}%\")\n```\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability problem. Let `T` be the lifetime of the atom. We want to find:\n`P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom of the same type decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nSo, we just need to calculate the probability of decay over a 150-minute interval:\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nUsing the `λ` we found in Step 1:\n`λ ≈ 0.003856`\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-0.003856 * 150)`\n`P(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.5784)`\n`P(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5608`\n`P(decay, 150) ≈ 0.4392`\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage:\n`0.4392 * 100% ≈ 44%`\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics: The \"Memoryless\" Nature of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means it has a \"memoryless\" property. This is a crucial concept for this problem. It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom doesn't \"get old\" or \"become more likely to decay\" just because it has survived for a while.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly created atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability of an atom decaying within a certain time `t` is given by the formula:\n`P(decay, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a unique value for each type of radioactive atom.\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718).\n*   `t` is the time interval.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find `λ`.\n\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nNow, we solve for `λ`:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nTake the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(e^(-100λ)) = ln(0.68)`\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes**\n\nAs established in Step 1, due to the memoryless property, we just need to calculate the probability of decay for a 150-minute period.\n\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `λ` we found in Step 2:\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\n\nSince `e^(ln(x)) = x`:\n`P(decay, 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n`0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n`P(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n`P(decay, 150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.4393. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n`0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%`\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
