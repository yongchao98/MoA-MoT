    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the behavior of current in a specific regime known as the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. To understand which statement is true, we need to analyze the fundamental assumptions made in the derivation of this equation.\n\n1.  **Device Type:** The equation is derived for a system where current is carried predominantly by one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes. Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. This immediately casts doubt on option D.\n\n2.  **Material Properties:** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney law, as given in the question, assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor. This means there are no trap states within the bandgap that can capture the injected carriers. If traps were present, the voltage dependence would be more complex. Thus, the model is for a **trap-free** material.\n\n3.  **Contacts and Carrier Injection:** The SCLC regime occurs when the injecting contact can supply more carriers than the bulk of the material can transport. This means the current is limited by the space charge (the cloud of injected carriers) built up in the material, not by the injection process itself. This requires an **Ohmic contact**, which, by definition, has no (or a negligible) energy barrier for carrier injection. A Schottky contact has a built-in energy barrier and would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current (at least at low voltages). Therefore, the equation is not valid for a device with a Schottky contact, ruling out option C. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is another way of describing an ideal Ohmic contact for this purpose.\n\n4.  **Current Transport Mechanism:** The model considers that the injected carriers move across the device under the influence of the applied electric field. This process is called **drift**. The other primary transport mechanism is diffusion, which arises from a concentration gradient. The Mott-Gurney derivation assumes that the **diffusion current is negligible** compared to the drift current. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not extremely thin and at voltages above the thermal voltage (kT/q). Option B states that the drift current is negligible, which is incorrect; the SCLC is fundamentally a drift current.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This statement correctly identifies all the key assumptions: a single-carrier device, trap-free material, an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier), and a drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion). This statement is **true**.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because the SCLC is a drift current. The drift current is the dominant component, not negligible.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because a Schottky contact is a barrier contact, which would lead to injection-limited current. SCLC requires an Ohmic contact.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for unipolar (single-carrier) injection.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
