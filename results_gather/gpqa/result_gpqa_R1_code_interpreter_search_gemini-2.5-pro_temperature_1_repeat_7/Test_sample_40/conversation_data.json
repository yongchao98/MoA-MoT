    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's break down the problem into defined variables and reference frames.\n\n**1. Define the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **S Frame (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n*   **S' Frame (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\n**2. Define the Velocities**\n\n*   **v:** The velocity of the S' frame (the glass) relative to the S frame (the laboratory). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n*   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the S' frame (the glass). This is the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass.\n*   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the S frame (the laboratory). This is the quantity we want to find.\n*   **c:** The speed of light in a vacuum. The problem sets `c=1`.\n\n**3. Determine the Velocity of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (u')**\n\nThe index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum `c` to the speed of light in the medium `u'`:\n`n = c / u'`\n\nGiven that `c = 1`, we can solve for `u'`:\n`n = 1 / u'`\n`u' = 1/n`\n\n**4. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\nThe formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we know into this formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\nTo get rid of the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply the entire expression by `n/n` (which is equal to 1):\n\n`u = [ n * ( (1/n) + v ) ] / [ n * ( 1 + v/n ) ]`\n\nNow, distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n*   **Numerator:** `n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v`\n*   **Denominator:** `n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v`\n\nSo, the simplified expression for `u` is:\n\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
