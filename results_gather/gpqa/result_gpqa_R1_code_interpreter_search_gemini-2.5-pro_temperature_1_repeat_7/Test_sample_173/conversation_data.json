    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single nucleus at rest.\n    *   Its rest mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments resulting from spontaneous fission.\n    *   Their rest masses are m1 and m2.\n    *   The nucleus is at rest, so the fragments move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n    *   We are given the relationship between their rest masses: m1 = 2 * m2. So, fragment 1 is the \"more massive fragment\".\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can use the given information to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (m1*c^2 and m2*c^2).\n\n*   From m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M, we can write (m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2).\n*   Substituting M*c^2 = 300 GeV, we get: (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We also know m1 = 2 * m2, which means m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2).\n*   Substitute this into the sum: 2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV.\n*   This simplifies to 3 * (m2*c^2) = 297 GeV.\n*   Solving for m2*c^2 gives: m2*c^2 = 297 GeV / 3 = 99 GeV.\n*   Now we find m1*c^2: m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy is converted into kinetic energy. This is known as the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n*   Conservation of energy states: E_initial = E_final.\n*   M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2), where T1 and T2 are the kinetic energies.\n*   The total kinetic energy is Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2).\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m), where p is momentum.\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   Using the classical formula, p^2 = 2*m*T.\n*   Since the momenta are equal: 2*m1*T1_cl = 2*m2*T2_cl, where the `_cl` denotes the classical value.\n*   This simplifies to m1*T1_cl = m2*T2_cl.\n*   Substituting m1 = 2*m2: 2*m2*T1_cl = m2*T2_cl, which gives T2_cl = 2*T1_cl.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy is T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T2_cl: T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3 GeV.\n*   3*T1_cl = 3 GeV, so **T1_cl = 1 GeV**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. The total energy is E = T + mc^2.\n\n*   We can rearrange the energy-momentum relation to solve for momentum: (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2).\n*   Again, we use the conservation of momentum, |p1| = |p2|, which means (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2.\n*   So, T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2).\n*   We can solve this equation for T1 by substituting the known values:\n    *   T2 = 3 GeV - T1\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n*   The following python code will solve this equation for T1.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define T1 as a symbolic variable\nT1 = sympy.Symbol('T1')\n\n# Rest mass energies in GeV\nm1c2 = 198\nm2c2 = 99\n\n# Total kinetic energy in GeV\nQ = 3\n\n# Expression for T2\nT2 = Q - T1\n\n# Relativistic momentum equation: (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2\n# T1**2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2**2 + 2*T2*m2c2\neq = sympy.Eq(T1**2 + 2*T1*m1c2, T2**2 + 2*T2*m2c2)\n\n# Solve the equation for T1\nsolution = sympy.solve(eq, T1)\n\n# The solution will be a list, we take the first element which is the numerical value\nT1_relativistic_GeV = solution[0]\n\n# The classical value calculated manually\nT1_classical_GeV = 1\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n5.00000000000000\n</execute_result>\n\n**6. Final Result**\n\n*   The correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 is 1.005 GeV.\n*   The classically approximated kinetic energy T1_cl is 1.0 GeV.\n*   The difference is T1 - T1_cl = 1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   Converting this difference to MeV: 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Variables and Initial Conditions**\n\n*   Initial rest mass of the nucleus: M\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: M*c² = 300 GeV\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   Rest mass of the more massive fragment: m₁\n*   Rest mass of the less massive fragment: m₂\n*   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment: T₁\n*   Kinetic energy of the less massive fragment: T₂\n\n**2. Use Given Information to Find Rest-Mass Energies of Fragments**\n\nWe are given two key pieces of information about the fragments:\n*   m₁ = 2 * m₂\n*   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n\nFrom this, we can find the rest-mass energies (m₁c² and m₂c²):\n*   Multiply the second equation by c²: m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)\n*   Substitute the value of Mc²: m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   We also know that m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²).\n*   Substitute this into the sum: 2*(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV\n*   3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV  =>  **m₂c² = 99 GeV**\n*   Therefore, **m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂\n*   By conservation of energy: Initial Energy = Final Energy\n*   M*c² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)\n*   M*c² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)\n*   300 GeV = 297 GeV + Q\n*   **Q = 3 GeV**\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m, where p is momentum.\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   From T = p²/2m, we have p² = 2mT.\n*   Therefore, 2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   Substitute m₁ = 2m₂:  2m₂T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2T₁_classical.\n*   We know T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n*   Substitute for T₂: T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV  =>  3T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (mc²) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   The total energy is E = T + mc².\n*   Rearranging for momentum: (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Again, from momentum conservation, |p₁| = |p₂|, which means (p₁c)² = (p₂c)².\n*   Therefore: T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)\n*   We know the values for m₁c² (198 GeV), m₂c² (99 GeV), and that T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Let's substitute them in:\n    T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n*   The T₁² terms on both sides cancel out:\n    396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603\n    600T₁ = 603\n    **T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n*   Convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
