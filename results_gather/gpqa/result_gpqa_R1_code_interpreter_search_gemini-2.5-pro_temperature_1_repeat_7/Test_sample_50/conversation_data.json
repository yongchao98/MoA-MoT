    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the conductor. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is a classic application of the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, which are created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be exactly replicated by a simpler system. This equivalent system consists of the original charge `q` and a single \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface `r=R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   Magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Location: at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the attractive force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on charge `q` (at a variable distance `x` from the center) due to the image charge `q'` (at `b=R^2/x`) is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n        The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'` at `b` is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        The image charge magnitude is `q' = -qR/x`.\n        `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from `∞` to `d`:\n        `U = W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx = - ∫[∞, d] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n        The integral of `x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` is `-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n        Evaluating the integral:\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` from `∞` to `d`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge**\n        A more direct method is to use the formula for interaction energy: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by all other charges (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge is itself dependent on `q`.\n        The potential `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        Now, substitute this into the energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    D) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - This matches our result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
