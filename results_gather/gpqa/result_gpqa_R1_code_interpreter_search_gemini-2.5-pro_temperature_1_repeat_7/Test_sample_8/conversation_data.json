    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (D)**\n    *   Structure: Quinuclidine is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n    *   Symmetry analysis:\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through the middle of one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Point Group: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes results in the **C3v** point group.\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   Structure: This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Symmetry analysis:\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are also three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through the center and bisecting the C-C bonds between the anhydride units.\n    *   Point Group: The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is higher than C3h.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This is a larger planar molecule based on a triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings). Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Symmetry analysis: Similar to molecule (C), this molecule has a highly symmetric, planar structure.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes in the molecular plane.\n    *   Point Group: Like molecule (C), its point group is **D3h**.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   Structure: The chemical formula is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three O atoms form a planar BO3 core.\n    *   Symmetry analysis: The overall symmetry depends on the conformation (rotation) of the three flexible isopropyl groups.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n        *   If the isopropyl groups arrange themselves so that the methine C-H bonds lie within the BO3 plane, and for each group, one methyl (CH3) is above the plane and one is below, the BO3 plane becomes a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In this specific conformation, there are no perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n        *   This conformation perfectly fits the requirements for the **C3h** point group.\n    *   Note: While the lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate is a \"propeller\" shape with C3 symmetry due to steric hindrance, the C3h conformation is a plausible, albeit higher-energy, arrangement. In the context of a multiple-choice question where the other options definitively belong to different point groups (C3v and D3h), triisopropyl borate is the only molecule that can be correctly assigned the C3h point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: Can adopt a **C3h** conformation.\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3v\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
