    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol proton (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis). This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph). The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unchanged. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl), reacts with ketones to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. Two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone, and the second deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. This dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene.\n*   **Result:** The ketone functionality at C1 is effectively removed and replaced with a double bond between C1 and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6). The regioselectivity is not critical for the final structure, as this double bond will be reduced in the next step.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain intact.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation system.\n*   **Reactions:**\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The Pd/C catalyst also cleaves the benzyl ether C-O bond. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (PhCH3) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring becomes fully saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl substituent becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The (benzyloxy)methyl substituent becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These substituents retain their 1,3-relationship from the starting material. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product before the final hydrogenolysis step. The benzyl ether is still present.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi).\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This perfectly matches the structure deduced from the reaction sequence. It is a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2OH group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone intermediate, not the final product of the four-step sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
