    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it has a C2 axis of rotation perpendicular to the double bond and passing through its center.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction, adding an oxygen atom across the double bond. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent is used for the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism where water acts as a nucleophile, resulting in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on an (E)-alkene. A general rule in stereochemistry states that the anti-addition to an (E)-alkene results in a meso compound, provided the substituents on the double bond are identical, which they are in this case (propyl groups).\n    *   Let's trace it: (E)-oct-4-ene -> (racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane) -> hydrolysis of either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound is achiral and has the configuration (4R,5S) or (4S,5R), which are identical.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** *Anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a (Z)-alkene. The stereochemistry rule for this is that the anti-addition to a (Z)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it: (Z)-oct-4-ene -> (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane) -> acid-catalyzed opening of the meso-epoxide results in a 50/50 mixture of the two possible enantiomeric products.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These are two distinct chiral compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds have the following relationship:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nNow we predict how this three-component mixture will behave on the two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated by the column. Thus, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: A single, combined peak for the enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can separate diastereomers *and* enantiomers (given the problem states resolution is as high as theoretically possible).\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **three peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
