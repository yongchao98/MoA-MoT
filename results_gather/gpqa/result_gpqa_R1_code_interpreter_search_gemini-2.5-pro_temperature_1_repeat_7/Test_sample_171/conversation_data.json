    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the Boltzmann equation is the appropriate tool to use.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (`i` and `j`) as a function of temperature (T):\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `N_i`, `N_j` are the number of atoms in states `i` and `j`.\n    *   `g_i`, `g_j` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_i`, `E_j` are the energies of the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** Let the excited state be level `i` and the ground state be level `g`. The energy difference is `ΔE = E_i - E_g`. The ratio of statistical weights `g_i / g_g` is a constant for this specific transition in the iron atom.\n\n    For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n    (N_i / N_g)_1 = (g_i / g_g) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n    (N_i / N_g)_2 = (g_i / g_g) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star_1.\n    (N_i / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_g)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 4.\n    (g_i / g_g) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_i / g_g) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the combined equation:** The term `(g_i / g_g)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To deal with the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation:** Isolate the `ln(2)` term.\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\n    Calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n\n10. **Finalize the equation:** Substitute the value of `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 8.\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n11. **Compare with the options:** This derived equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
