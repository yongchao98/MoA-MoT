    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n*   **Components:** The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   **States:** Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible configurations (microstates) for the system.\n*   **Energy:** The energy of any given configuration is defined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n*   **Partition Function:** The partition function (Z) is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\n\n### 2. Enumerating States and Calculating Energies\nWe need to list all 8 possible microstates and calculate the energy for each one. Let's denote a state by the tuple (S1, S2, S3).\n\n| State (S1, S2, S3) | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum (S1S2+S1S3+S2S3) | Energy E = -J * Sum |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | -3J |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | 1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 | 1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 | -1 | 1 | -1 | J |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 | -1 | 1 | -1 | J |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 | 1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | 1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | -3J |\n\n### 3. Grouping by Energy Levels\nFrom the table, we can see that there are only two distinct energy values for the system. We can group the states by their energy and find the degeneracy (g) of each energy level.\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E₁):**\n    *   Energy E₁ = -3J\n    *   This energy occurs when all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1)\n    *   Degeneracy (g₁) = 2\n\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E₂):**\n    *   Energy E₂ = J\n    *   This energy occurs for all other configurations, where the spins are not all aligned.\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n    *   Degeneracy (g₂) = 6\n\n### 4. Calculating the Partition Function\nThe partition function Z can now be calculated by summing the contributions from each energy level, taking degeneracy into account:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstitute the values we found for the degeneracies and energies:\n*   g₁ = 2, E₁ = -3J\n*   g₂ = 6, E₂ = J\n\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
