    "This problem requires us to determine which two compounds, from a given list, are present in a 1:1 mixture based on its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum of the Mixture:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (splitting pattern), and their relative integration. All alkyl groups are methyls except for 1,4-diethylbenzene, so we expect singlets for the tetramethylbenzenes.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry between C1-C2 and C4-C5, and another between C2-C3 and C5-C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will produce a single signal. This will be a **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they will be **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by reflection across the symmetry plane (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is on the symmetry plane and is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is on the symmetry plane and is unique (a 3H signal).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce a single signal. Although they are adjacent (ortho), their chemical equivalence results in a **singlet** (or a complex pattern that looks like a singlet) integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (a 6H signal).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a 6H signal).\n        *   These two sets are in different environments. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**, giving a **1:1** ratio.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the CH2 group are adjacent to the three protons of the CH3 group, so they will be split into a quartet. The protons of the CH3 group are adjacent to the two protons of the CH2 group, so they will be split into a triplet. The problem states that the aliphatic signals are all singlets. Therefore, this compound can be **ruled out**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture for Each Option**\n\nNow let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets. This contradicts the data.\n    *   Aliphatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show four singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, assuming they have different chemical shifts, this will result in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H = **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. In a mixture, this will result in **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three singlets. This contradicts the data.\n    *   Aliphatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show up to five singlets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-TMB and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe only pair that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
