    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. The eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the desired outcome:** A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want to find the joint probability of getting the following eigenvalues:\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$ for electron 1.\n    *   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$ for electron 2.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial state and the measurement outcome state:** The initial state $|l, m>$ is given in the *coupled basis*. The measurement outcome state, characterized by $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$, is a state in the *uncoupled basis*. The probability of finding the system in the state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ after the measurement is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state:\n    $P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l_1, l_2, l, m>|^2$\n\n    For this problem, we need to calculate:\n    $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the total z-component is the sum of the individual z-components. The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   When $L_z$ acts on a state in the coupled basis $|l, m>$, the eigenvalue is $m\\hbar$.\n    *   When $L_z$ acts on a state in the uncoupled basis $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$, the eigenvalue is $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar$.\n\n5.  **Check for consistency:**\n    *   For the initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state, characterized by $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Draw the conclusion:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ (since $m=-1$). The state we want to measure is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$ (since $m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-2$).\n    In quantum mechanics, eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product of these two states is zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\n    This is also reflected in the properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the coefficients that expand the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states. The coefficient $C_{m_{l1} m_{l2} m}^{l_1 l_2 l} = <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is non-zero only if $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. In our case, $-1 \\neq -2$, so the coefficient is zero.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability is the square of the magnitude of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to get the measurement outcome where both electrons have a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$. The probability is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
