    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\n*   The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n*   Therefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. The parent molecule is named as a benzoic acid.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as carbon #1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents based on Relative Positions**\n\nLet's place the groups on the benzene ring, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **-COOH at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as 'formyl' substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group are at C3 and C5.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\"\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6.\n*   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nAt this point, we have the following assignments:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Configuration**\n\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: 'alcohol' refers to the hydroxyl group, and 'nitrile' refers to the cyano group).\n\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   We know the hydroxyl group is at either C2 or C6.\n*   We know the cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case A: Assume the cyano group is at C5.** For the methoxy (C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at C4 and C6. This matches our partial structure, so the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n*   **Case B: Assume the cyano group is at C3.** For the methoxy (C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at C4 and C2. This also matches our partial structure, so the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n\nWe now have two possible structures:\n\n*   **Structure A:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH\n*   **Structure B:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Structure**\n\n*   IUPAC rules state that when there is a choice in numbering, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents listed as prefixes.\n*   The locant set for both structures is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so this rule doesn't resolve the tie.\n*   The tie-breaker rule is to assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Structure A, \"cyano\" is at C5.\n    *   In Structure B, \"cyano\" is at C3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Structure B is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the positions from the correct structure (Structure B), we assemble the name.\n\n*   **Structure B:**\n    *   C2: hydroxy\n    *   C3: cyano\n    *   C4: methoxy\n    *   C5: formyl\n    *   C6: dimethylamino\n*   List the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   Combine these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe name we derived matches option C exactly.\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, based on Structure A)\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, based on Structure A)\n\n<<<C>>>"
