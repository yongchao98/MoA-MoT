    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions. Therefore, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n2.  **Energy Levels of a Single Particle:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a potential are quantized and given by the formula:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n\n3.  **Use the Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed more simply as:\n    `E_n = n^2 * E`\n\n4.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin up or `-1/2` for spin down). This means that for each energy level `n`, there are two available spin states. Consequently, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four fermions.\n    *   The lowest energy level is `n=1`. We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   The next lowest energy level is `n=2`. We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n    The particle configuration for the ground state is `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^2`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_first):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^2`, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n    *   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n    *   The new configuration is `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^1`.\n    *   The total energy for this configuration is:\n        `E_first = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n        `E_first = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E)`\n        `E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_second):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible single-particle excitations from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state and find the one with the lowest energy.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The ground state is `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^2`. The new configuration would be `(n=1)^1 (n=2)^2 (n=3)^1`.\n        Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The new configuration would be `(n=1)^2 (n=3)^2`.\n        Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The new configuration would be `(n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=4)^1`.\n        Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 4^2 * E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n    Therefore, the second excited state energy is `E_second = 18E`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground state energy = **10E**\n    *   First excited state energy = **15E**\n    *   Second excited state energy = **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
