    "*   **Analysis of the Provided Information:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR Data:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, and they are of \"roughly equal\" intensity, suggesting a ~1:1 mixture of two species.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\n        *   This indicates the alpha-proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, again with equal intensities. This means there are two compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (interaction with the stationary phase).\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for *both* peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the target molecule. This proves that the two separable compounds are isomers of each other (same molecular formula, same mass), not an impurity with a different chemical formula (like a precursor or a side-product with a different composition).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A proton in one diastereomer will be in a slightly different chemical environment than the corresponding proton in the other, leading to two different peaks. This matches the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This would produce two peaks in the LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, which would give identical mass spectra. This perfectly matches the LC-MS observation.\n        *   **Plausibility in Peptides:** This is a very common phenomenon in peptide chemistry. It can arise from two main sources: 1) Epimerization of one stereocenter during synthesis (e.g., partial conversion of an L-amino acid to a D-amino acid). 2) *Cis-trans* isomerism about a peptide bond, which is particularly common and has a slow rate of interconversion for X-Proline bonds. These *cis/trans* isomers are diastereomers of each other, and they often give two sets of peaks in NMR and can sometimes be separated by LC.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR/LC:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished by standard NMR or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column. This contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Analysis:** A precursor would be a chemically different molecule and would almost certainly have a different molecular weight.\n        *   **Contradiction:** The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the target product. This rules out a precursor impurity.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Analysis:** This refers to a side reaction creating a new covalent bond, such as adding an extra amino acid. This would create a product with a different chemical formula and a different molecular weight.\n        *   **Contradiction:** Like the precursor argument, this is ruled out by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the expected mass of the product.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that fits all the observations (two NMR signals for one proton, two separable peaks on LC, and identical mass for both peaks) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
