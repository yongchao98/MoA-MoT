    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via a two-step process, with an intermediate state. The question specifies that these are electric dipole transitions (E1).\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition between an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    *   **First transition:** The atom decays from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_i = 0$, so $l_{int}$ must be $1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_i = 0$, so $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int}$. This means $m_{int}$ can be $0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: For decay, $n_{int} < n_i = 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n_{int}=2$. This is the most likely decay, as the transition frequency ($\\omega \\propto 1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2$) is largest for the smallest possible change in $n$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l_{int} = 1$ and $l_f = 0$, so $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m_f = 0$, so $\\Delta m = 0 - m_{int}$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$, which is true for all possible intermediate values of $m_{int}$ ($0, \\pm 1$).\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n_f=1 < n_{int}=2$. This is allowed.\n\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes are possible:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) of Each Route:**\n    *   The overall probability of a specific cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state has only one path to the final state (which is true here, as $|2,1,m\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via E1).\n    *   The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ is the ratio of the rate of that specific transition to the total rate of all possible transitions from the initial state.\n    *   The transition rate $W_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $W_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n    *   We need to calculate the rates for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ for $m_{int} = 0, +1, -1$. The rate is proportional to $|\\langle 2,1,m_{int} | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |x| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |y| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_{int} |z| 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Matrix Elements:**\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This has a significant consequence. The Wigner-Eckart theorem shows that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state, the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels of the final state are equal.\n    *   Let's verify this. Let $\\mathcal{R}$ be the radial integral $\\int R_{21}(r) r R_{30}(r) r^2 dr$, which is a constant factor for all three transitions. The calculation of the angular parts gives:\n        *   For $m_{int} = 0$: The transition is driven by the $z$ component of the dipole operator. $|\\langle 2,1,0 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n        *   For $m_{int} = +1$: The transition is driven by the $x$ and $y$ components. $|\\langle 2,1,1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle x \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle y \\rangle|^2 = (\\frac{\\mathcal{R}^2}{6}) + (\\frac{\\mathcal{R}^2}{6}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n        *   For $m_{int} = -1$: The calculation is similar to $m_{int}=+1$ and gives $|\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathcal{R}^2$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Branching Ratios:**\n    *   The transition rates are equal: $W_{|300\\rangle \\to |210\\rangle} = W_{|300\\rangle \\to |211\\rangle} = W_{|300\\rangle \\to |21-1\\rangle}$. Let's call this rate $W_0$.\n    *   The only allowed E1 decays from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ are to these three states. So, the total decay rate is $W_{total} = W_0 + W_0 + W_0 = 3W_0$.\n    *   The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these routes is:\n        $P(m_{int}) = \\frac{W_0}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_0}{3W_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
