    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo (the fraction of power scattered back into space).\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\nT_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\nThe ratio is:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [sqrt(1 / a1)] / [sqrt(1 / a2)]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. To find the temperature ratio, we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is used to calculate the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nThe formula relating the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the planet's properties for a circular orbit is:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\nwhere `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity, `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the planet's velocity is `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)` (assuming M_p << M_star).\nSubstituting this in, we get:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p * sin(i)) * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n\nThe problem states that the planets were detected by the transit method as well. This implies that their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, and thus sin(i) ≈ 1. We will assume sin(i) is the same and equal to 1 for both planets.\n\n**5. Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nLet's rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (a * M_star)\na = (M_p^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [ (M2^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (K2^2 * M_star) ] / [ (M1^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (K1^2 * M_star) ]\n\nThe terms `G`, `M_star`, and `sin^2(i)` are the same for both and cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M2^2 / K2^2) / (M1^2 / K1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M2 / M1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Amplitude:**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M2 / M1):**\n    M1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M2 / M1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n    The radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ0)`. The semi-amplitude `K` is the maximum `v_r`.\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n    Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n    Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the mass and RV amplitude ratios back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio a2/a1\na2_over_a1 = (5/7)**2 * (3/4)**2\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio T_eq1/T_eq2\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n> 실행 결과:\n> ```\n> 0.5357142857142857\n> ```\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which is very close to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    *   `T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)`\n    *   `T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)`\n\n    When we divide T_eq1 by T_eq2, several terms cancel out:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`.\n    *   The constant `2` also cancels.\n\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(1/a1)] / [sqrt(1/a2)]`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n    This means we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Connecting to Radial Velocity (RV) Data:** The problem provides Doppler shift data, which is used to determine the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, `K` is given by:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)` is the planet's orbital velocity (assuming the planet's mass `M_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`). `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i)) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a2 / a1):** We can rearrange the equation for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    *   Square both sides: `K^2 = (M_p^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (a * M_star)`\n    *   Isolate `a`: `a = (M_p^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (K^2 * M_star)`\n\n    Now, we can form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [ (M2^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (K2^2 * M_star) ] / [ (M1^2 * sin^2(i) * G) / (K1^2 * M_star) ]`\n\n    The terms `G`, `M_star` cancel out because they are the same for both systems. The problem also states that both planets were detected via the transit method, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination `i` is close to 90° for both, so `sin(i)` is approximately 1 and can be considered the same for both planets. Therefore, `sin^2(i)` also cancels out.\n\n    The ratio simplifies to:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M2^2 / K2^2) / (M1^2 / K1^2)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (M2 / M1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M2 / M1):**\n        *   M1 = 7 Earth masses\n        *   M2 = 5 Earth masses\n        *   `M2 / M1 = 5 / 7`\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The radial velocity `v` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by the formula `v = c * (Δλ / λ0)`. The RV semi-amplitude `K` is the maximum value of `v`. Since `c` (speed of light) and `λ0` (rest wavelength) are constants for both measurements, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n        *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        *   `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate `a2 / a1`:\n        `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n    *   Now, calculate the temperature ratio:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n    *   Numerically, `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which matches option C. Note that the information about the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii were not needed to find the ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given ratios\n# Mass ratio M2/M1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n# Doppler shift ratio Δλ1/Δλ2, which is equal to the RV semi-amplitude ratio K1/K2\nk_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes squared (a2/a1) is (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_over_a1 = mass_ratio**2 * k_ratio**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we start with the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. We can derive this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n\nK ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n\nFrom this, we can write:\nK1 ∝ M1 / sqrt(a1)\nK2 ∝ M2 / sqrt(a2)\n\nNow, we can solve for `sqrt(a)`:\nsqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K\n\nThen, the ratio `sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1)` is:\nsqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = (M2 / K2) / (M1 / K1) = (M2 / M1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nWe know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1). Therefore:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2 / M1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2):\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nM2 / M1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
