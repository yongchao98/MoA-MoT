    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Problem\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\nThe integral is `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV`.\n\n### 2. Define the Vector Field and the Volume\n*   **Vector Field `f`**: The field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this can be written as:\n    `f(r, θ, φ) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction. The field only has a radial component, `f_r = 1/r^2`, while `f_θ = 0` and `f_φ = 0`.\n\n*   **Volume `V`**: The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The surface enclosing this volume, `S`, is the surface of this sphere.\n\n### 3. Choose a Method for Evaluation\nWe have two primary methods to solve this:\n1.  **Direct Calculation**: First compute the divergence `∇.f` and then integrate it over the volume `V`.\n2.  **Divergence Theorem**: Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem) to convert the volume integral into a surface integral.\n\nThe vector field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is singular at the origin `r = 0`. This can make direct evaluation of the volume integral tricky. The Divergence Theorem is often simpler in such cases because it moves the calculation to the boundary surface, avoiding the singularity inside. We will use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 4. Apply the Divergence Theorem\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`, and `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Surface Integral\n*   **Surface `S`**: The surface is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial coordinate `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n\n*   **Vector Field on the Surface**: We evaluate `f` on the surface `S` (where `r=R`):\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **Differential Surface Area `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = r^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of the surface element vector `dS` is the outward normal, which is the radial direction `r̂`. So:\n    `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`\n\n*   **Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**: Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Integrate over the Surface `S`**: The surface integral is performed over the entire sphere, so the limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ( ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ ) * ( ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n    Evaluate each integral:\n    1.  `∫[from φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ]` from 0 to 2π `= 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    2.  `∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]` from 0 to π `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n### Alternative Method (Briefly)\nOne could also calculate the divergence directly. The divergence of `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is `∇.f = 0` for `r ≠ 0`. However, at the origin `r = 0`, the field is infinite, and the divergence is a Dirac delta function: `∇⋅(r̂/r²) = 4πδ³(r)`.\nThe volume integral becomes:\n`∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume (a sphere of radius R) includes the origin, the integral of the delta function over this volume is 1.\n`∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
