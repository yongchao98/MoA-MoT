    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Introduce the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges (free electrons) within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface. For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. This implies that the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be equal and opposite to the charge placed inside it. Therefore, a charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this $-q$ charge on the inner surface will be non-uniform, arranged in such a way as to cancel the electric field produced by the $+q$ charge for all points within the conductor.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a net positive charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation (the initial net charge was zero). This excess positive charge, $+q$, will reside on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. This has a powerful consequence known as electrostatic shielding. The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electric fields created by the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$). As a result, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is not influenced by the position of the cavity or the charge within it. It will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface to minimize repulsion, just as if it were the only charge present on an isolated spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the electric field outside the conductor:** We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the vector sum of the fields produced by:\n    a. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    b. The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface.\n    c. The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Applying the shielding principle:** Due to electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced by the charge inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge on the inner surface ($-q$) is zero for all points outside the cavity. So, for point P, we only need to consider the electric field generated by the charge on the outer surface.\n\n8.  **Field from the outer surface charge:** We have a charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly over a spherical surface of radius $R$. According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** The problem states that point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is equivalent to the field from a point charge $+q$ located at the conductor's center. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance from center)}^2}$\n\n    Substituting our values:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The specific details about the cavity's location ($s$), its radius ($r$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all extraneous information designed to distract from the core principle of electrostatic shielding. The field outside the conductor only depends on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from its center.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the electric field at point P is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
