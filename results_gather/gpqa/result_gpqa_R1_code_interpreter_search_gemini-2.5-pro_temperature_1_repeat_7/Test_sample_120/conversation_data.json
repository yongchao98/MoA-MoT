    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The epoxide oxygen (atom 7) forms a bridge between carbons C1 and C6. This is essentially a substituted cyclohexene oxide.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We can represent this structure in 2D with wedges and dashes to denote the 3D arrangement. Let's assume the cyclohexane ring is roughly in the plane of the paper and the epoxide ring is cis-fused, pointing out of the page (wedge).\n\n    *   Draw a hexagon for the cyclohexane ring and a wedged triangle for the epoxide across C1-C6.\n    *   **At C1 (1R):** C1 is bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group. To have an (R) configuration with the O on a wedge, the lowest priority group (the methyl group) must be on a dash (pointing into the page). Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me. Looking from the methyl group, the path O -> C6 -> C2 is clockwise, which confirms (R).\n    *   **At C6 (6S):** C6 is bonded to O, C1, C5, and an H atom. With the O on a wedge, the lowest priority group (H) must be on a dash. Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H. Looking from H, the path O -> C1 -> C5 is counter-clockwise, which confirms (S).\n    *   **At C3 (3R):** C3 is bonded to C2, C4, a methyl group, and an H atom. To have an (R) configuration, with H being the lowest priority group, we place H on a dash. The methyl group must then be on a wedge. Priorities: C4 > C2 > Me > H. Looking from H, the path C4 -> C2 -> Me is clockwise, confirming (R).\n    *   **At C4 (4R):** Similar to C3, to get an (R) configuration, the methyl group must be on a wedge and the H on a dash. Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H. Looking from H, the path C3 -> C5 -> Me is clockwise, confirming (R).\n\nThe resulting structure is a cis-epoxide (O is \"up\") with a methyl group at C1 \"down\", a methyl at C3 \"up\", and a methyl at C4 \"up\".\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The reactive species is the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon. This is a typical S_N2-type mechanism.\n    *   The attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond. In our structure, the C6-O bond is on a wedge (\"up\").\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group must attack C6 from the dash side (\"down\").\n    *   This attack breaks the C6-O bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide at C1. A subsequent aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack:** A new C-C bond forms between a methyl group and C6. This new methyl group is on a dash.\n2.  **Inversion:** The original substituent on the dash side at C6 was an H atom. The S_N2 attack pushes this H atom to the wedge side. So, at C6, we now have a methyl group on a dash and an H atom on a wedge.\n3.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond remains, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. Since the C1-O bond was on a wedge, the resulting -OH group is also on a wedge.\n4.  **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not affected by the reaction.\n\n**4. Name the Product and Determine its Stereochemistry**\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexanol. We need to name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\n*   **Parent Name:** The principal functional group is the hydroxyl group. The carbon it is attached to (the original C1) is designated as C1 of the new cyclohexanol ring.\n*   **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   We have methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4, and a new one at C6.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the OH group gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (New C1=Old C1, New C2=Old C6, New C4=Old C4, New C5=Old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives methyl groups at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Comparing the sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first set is lower. So, the correct name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** Now we determine the R/S configuration for each chiral center using the new numbering.\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** The configuration was (R) and this center did not react. It remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** The configuration was (R) and this center did not react. It remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** The configuration was (R) and this center did not react. It remains **(5R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** This is the center where inversion occurred. The original configuration was (S). We expect the new configuration to be (R). Let's verify.\n        *   At New C2, the groups are H (wedge), Me (dash), New C1, and New C3.\n        *   Priorities: New C1 > New C3 > Me > H.\n        *   The lowest priority group (H) is on a wedge (in front). So, we determine the direction of the remaining groups and reverse the result.\n        *   The path from New C1 -> New C3 -> Me is counter-clockwise.\n        *   Reversing counter-clockwise gives clockwise, which corresponds to **(R)**.\n        *   So the configuration at New C2 is **(2R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product:** Combining the name and the stereochemistry, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
