    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution. The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reactions.**\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to give 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n    *   The solution contains the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-, which forms a buffer solution.\n    *   The relevant equilibria for the phosphate system are:\n        1.  H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4- (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n        2.  H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n        3.  HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n    *   Since the main components are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the pH of the solution is primarily determined by the second equilibrium (Ka2).\n    *   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution.**\n    *   We use the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   In a buffer solution, we can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n        [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    *   We use the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    *   Again, we use the initial concentration for [HPO4^2-] and the [H+] calculated in the previous step.\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n        [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTo obtain a more precise result, we can perform the calculation using a script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# From the equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# From the equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.3e}\")\n```\n>\n6.235e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.235 x 10^-7 M, which is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the components and their roles.**\n    *   The solution is created by dissolving KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely in water to give K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion). H₂PO₄⁻ acts as a weak acid.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely in water to give 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion), along with water molecules. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Therefore, we have a buffer solution composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant chemical equilibria.**\n    The dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) occurs in three steps:\n    *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻; Ka₁ = 7.5 x 10⁻³\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻; Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻; Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n    *   The pH of the buffer is primarily controlled by the second equilibrium (Ka₂), as the main species are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka₃).\n\n3.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g. Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n        *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g. Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n        *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₂: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]. We assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₃: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   We rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻].\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   The calculated value is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   A) 5.48 x 10⁻⁷ M\n    *   B) 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 3.97 x 10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 2.81 x 10⁻⁷ M\n    *   The calculated value is closest to option B. The slight difference is due to rounding during intermediate steps. The python code execution, which minimizes rounding errors, gave `6.236e-07`, confirming that B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
