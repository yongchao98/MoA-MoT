    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**1. Define the System and Conserved Quantities**\n\n*   We have a particle of rest mass $m$ subject to a Hooke's Law force, $F = -kx$.\n*   The potential energy associated with this force is $U(x) = -\\int F dx = \\int kx dx = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n*   In special relativity, the total energy of a particle with velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This total energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n*   The total energy of our oscillating system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring. This total system energy is conserved.\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**2. Analyze the System at Key Points**\n\nWe will apply the principle of conservation of energy by evaluating the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n*   **At the maximum amplitude (turning point):**\n    *   The position is $x = A$.\n    *   The mass momentarily comes to a stop, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position:**\n    *   The position is $x = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed is at its maximum, so $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nSince the total energy of the system is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate $v_{max}$.\n*   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n*   To solve for the term with $v_{max}$, we can invert both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n*   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n*   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
