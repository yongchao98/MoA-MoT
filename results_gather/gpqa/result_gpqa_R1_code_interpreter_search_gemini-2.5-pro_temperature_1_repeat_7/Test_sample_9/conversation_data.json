    "Rationale Breakdown:\n\n1.  **Analyze the options:** The question asks to identify the exoplanet with the highest density from a list of four scenarios.\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This sets our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This is our reference point.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly. It is approximately the same as Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". For planets with the same rocky composition, density is not constant. As mass increases, the planet's own gravity compresses its material more tightly. This gravitational compression leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet made of the same stuff as Earth will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"Sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet experiences less gravitational compression. Its constituent materials will be less compacted than in a more massive body. Consequently, its overall density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n2.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Planet (a): Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³ (Earth's density).\n    *   Planet (b): Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³ (given).\n    *   Planet (c): Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and gravitational compression).\n    *   Planet (d): Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less gravitational compression).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the expected densities, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density. The increased mass leads to greater self-gravity, which compresses the planet's material and increases its overall density.\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate, we can use the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.27 (where R is radius and M is mass).\nDensity (ρ) is proportional to M/R³.\nSo, ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\nThis shows that for planets of the same composition, density increases with mass.\n*   For planet (c), M = 5 M_Earth, so its density will be (5)^0.19 ≈ 1.35 times Earth's density, or about 1.35 * 5.51 ≈ 7.4 g/cm³.\n*   For planet (d), M = 0.5 M_Earth, so its density will be (0.5)^0.19 ≈ 0.88 times Earth's density, or about 0.88 * 5.51 ≈ 4.8 g/cm³.\n\nThis calculation confirms that planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
