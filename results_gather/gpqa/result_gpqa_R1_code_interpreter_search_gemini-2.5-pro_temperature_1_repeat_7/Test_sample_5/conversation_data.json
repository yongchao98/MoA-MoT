    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:** The given potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). This is given in 2D polar coordinates (r, θ). To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often best to find a coordinate system in which the potential is separable.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** Let's convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (r cos(θ))^2\n    Since x = r cos(θ), we can replace r^2 cos^2(θ) with x^2:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:** Now, combine the terms:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Identify the Separable Potentials:** The potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2, is the sum of two independent one-dimensional potentials:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n    This describes a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Relate to the Standard Harmonic Oscillator:** The standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is V(q) = 1/2 mω^2q^2, where m is the mass and ω is the angular frequency. The energy spectrum for this oscillator is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n6.  **Find the Angular Frequencies (ω_x and ω_y):**\n    *   For the x-direction:\n        1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n        mω_x^2 = 4k\n        ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   For the y-direction:\n        1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n        mω_y^2 = k\n        ω_y^2 = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Determine the Total Energy Spectrum:** Since the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the independent x and y oscillators:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n\n    Substitute the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * (sqrt(k/m))\n\n8.  **Simplify the Energy Expression:** Factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:** The derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
