    "This problem requires us to compare two different phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness: the rotation of a star with cool spots and the transit of an exoplanet. We need to find the size of a planet that would produce the same brightness dip as the spots.\n\n**Step 1: Define the brightness variation due to starspots.**\n\nThe star has two distinct hemispheres: one is pristine, and the other has 20% of its area covered by cooler, dark spots. The star's brightness will appear to change as it rotates, showing its different faces to the observer.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (L_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴). Let's denote the flux from the unspotted photosphere as F_phot ∝ T_eff⁴.\n    L_max ∝ F_phot ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (L_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer. This hemisphere's light is a combination of the normal photosphere (80% of the area) and the cooler spots (20% of the area). The filling factor (f_spot) is 0.20. The flux from the spots is F_spot ∝ T_spot⁴.\n    L_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * F_phot + f_spot * F_spot\n    L_min ∝ (1 - 0.20) * T_eff⁴ + 0.20 * T_spot⁴\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation.**\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in brightness from the maximum to the minimum.\n\nAmplitude = (L_max - L_min) / L_max\n\nSubstituting the proportionalities:\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   f_spot = 0.20\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n\n**Step 3: Model the brightness drop due to an exoplanet transit.**\n\nThe brightness drop during an exoplanet transit (known as the transit depth, δ) is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\nδ = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**Step 4: Equate the two effects and solve for the planet's relative radius.**\n\nThe problem states that the exoplanet should produce the same amplitude signal. Therefore, the transit depth (δ) must equal the spot modulation amplitude.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n\nNow we can solve for R_pl / R_star using a simple calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties\nT_eff = 6000.0\nT_spot = 5000.0\nf_spot = 0.20\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the flux variation due to spots\namplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of the hypothetical exoplanet is equal to this amplitude.\n# The transit depth is (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude).\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{relative_radius=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nrelative_radius=0.3217929424075131\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius of the planet (R_pl / R_star) is approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value is a very close match to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to equate the amplitude of photometric variation caused by stellar rotation of a spotted star with the transit depth caused by a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the Photometric Variation due to Starspots**\n\nThe brightness of the star varies as it rotates, showing a completely unspotted hemisphere at its maximum brightness and a partially spotted hemisphere at its minimum brightness. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux (F) emitted per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T), i.e., F ∝ T⁴.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (L_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is determined by the star's effective temperature, T_eff.\n    L_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (L_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere is not entirely covered by spots. It has a spot filling factor (f_spot) of 20% (or 0.20). This means 20% of its surface is at the spot temperature (T_spot) and the remaining 80% (or 1 - f_spot) is at the effective temperature (T_eff).\n    L_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in brightness from the maximum to the minimum.\n    Amplitude = (L_max - L_min) / L_max\n    Substituting the flux expressions (the proportionality constants cancel out):\n    Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = [f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n    Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n**2. Calculate the Transit Depth of an Exoplanet**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting dip in brightness, known as the transit depth (δ), is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\nδ = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\nwhere R_pl is the planet's radius and R_star is the star's radius.\n\n**3. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem asks for the planet size that would produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots. Therefore, we set the transit depth equal to the spot variation amplitude.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   f_spot = 0.20\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf_spot = 0.20    # Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the photometric variation caused by the spots\n# Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of the hypothetical exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We set this equal to the spot amplitude and solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star).\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl / R_star) is: {relative_radius}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nThe relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl / R_star) is: 0.3217929424075131\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.3218.
