    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which brominates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reactant: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n    *   Product 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n2.  **Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Reactant 1: α-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)\n    *   Product 2: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   Reactant: Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Product 3: Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   This step involves a sequence of reactions typical for malonic ester synthesis derivatives, leading to cyclization.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic α-hydrogens (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt). The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **b. Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The product from the previous step still has one acidic α-hydrogen. Since the problem states \"excess sodium hydride,\" there is enough base to remove this second proton.\n        NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **d. Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n        [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻ → Final Product 4 + Br⁻\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### Structure and 1H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The NMR spectrum observed is a time-averaged spectrum of all conformations.\n*   The time-averaged structure of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate possesses a **plane of symmetry (Cs)**. This plane passes through C1 (with its substituents), the C1-C4 bond axis, and C4.\n*   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their associated protons chemically equivalent:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\nNow, let's count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are enantiotopic due to the plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard achiral NMR solvent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Protons at C2 and C6 (4H total):** The two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically non-equivalent. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C6 equivalent to their corresponding partners on C2. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons at C3 and C5 (4H total):** Similarly, the two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes them equivalent to their counterparts on C5. This results in **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons at C4 (2H total):** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two geminal protons at C4 are not interchanged by the plane and are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic. This results in **2 signals** for these two protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming the signals from each distinct environment:\n1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
