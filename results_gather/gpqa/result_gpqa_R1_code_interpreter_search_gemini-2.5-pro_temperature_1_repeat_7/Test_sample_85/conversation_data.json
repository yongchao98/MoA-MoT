    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an ester group, also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   The ring consists of one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms.\n*   The carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 (adjacent to the ring oxygen).\n*   An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is at position 4.\n*   The stereocenter is at carbon C4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a precursor molecule: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's verify this:\nHOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH\nThe hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a six-membered ring. The chiral center is at C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 in the resulting lactone. The reaction does not affect the chiral center, so the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nAll options propose the same base structure for starting materials A and B: **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\nThe structure is: iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end.\n*   An isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at the other end.\nThe chiral center is at C3, which corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4). LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is known to reduce esters more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids (which first deprotonate to form a less reactive carboxylate salt).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 will selectively reduce the **ester** group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is left largely unreacted.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the final lactonization step.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3), its configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3). Borane is a classic reagent used to selectively reduce carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction must also produce the same lactone structure, which means it must also proceed through the **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid** intermediate. Let's see how.\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COOiBu) is left untouched. The initial product is isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate (HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu).\n    2.  The reaction is followed by an acidic workup (\"+ H+\"). In this context, the acidic conditions will not only process the borane intermediates but also catalyze the **hydrolysis** of the isobutyl ester back to a carboxylic acid.\n    3.  The hydrolysis of the hydroxy-ester yields **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    4.  This hydroxy-acid then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, none of the steps in this sequence affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
