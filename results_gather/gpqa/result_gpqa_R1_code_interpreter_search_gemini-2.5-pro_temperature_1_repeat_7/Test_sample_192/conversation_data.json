    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship in a specific region of the sky.\n    *   The relationship is between the \"number of stars\" and \"parallax (plx)\".\n    *   The relationship is given as: Number of stars ∝ 1/plx⁵.\n    *   We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of distance (r)\" changes with distance.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Relationship**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" can be ambiguous. It could mean the cumulative number of stars up to a certain distance (corresponding to a minimum parallax), or it could mean the number density of stars with respect to parallax.\n    *   In physics and astronomy, when describing how a quantity distributes over a continuous variable, \"varies with\" often refers to the density or distribution function. For example, \"population density varies with distance from the city center\".\n    *   Let's assume it means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as dN/d(plx). This is the most common interpretation in similar astronomical problems.\n    *   So, our starting point is:\n        dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal**\n    *   We want to find \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\".\n    *   This is the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is written as dN/dr.\n\n4.  **Relate the Quantities**\n    *   We need to find a relationship between dN/dr and dN/d(plx). We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n        dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)\n    *   We also need the fundamental relationship between distance (r) and parallax (plx). For astronomical distances, they are inversely proportional. In standard units (r in parsecs, plx in arcseconds), the relation is:\n        r = 1/plx  or  plx = 1/r\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    *   First, let's find the derivative d(plx)/dr:\n        plx = r⁻¹\n        d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (r) increases, parallax (plx) decreases. Since we are interested in the magnitude of the change or the proportionality, we can use the absolute value: |d(plx)/dr| = 1/r².\n    *   Now, substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation:\n        dN/dr ∝ |(dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)|\n        dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   The expression on the right has both plx and r. We need to express it solely in terms of r to answer the question. Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n        dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n        dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)\n        dN/dr ∝ r³\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to the cube of the distance (r³).\n\n7.  **Match with Options**\n    *   The result ~ r³ corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
