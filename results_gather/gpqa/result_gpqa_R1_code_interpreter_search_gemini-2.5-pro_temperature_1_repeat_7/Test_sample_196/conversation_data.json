    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the IR spectrum of Compound X.**\n*   The broad absorption peak in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can conclude that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Compound X.**\nLet's break down each signal to determine the structure:\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) appearing far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n*   Now let's determine the structure of the other substituent using the remaining signals: **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H represents a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂C**H₃**).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-C**H₂**-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it's split by both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and a methine group (1H).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H represents another methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H is the methine group (-C**H**-). Its downfield shift to 2.9 ppm indicates it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is coupled to the protons of the adjacent methyl group (3H) and methylene group (2H).\n\nAssembling this alkyl group: The benzylic carbon (-CH-) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This entire group is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Compound X.**\nBased on the analysis, Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the 4-position. Its name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\nCompound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent combination. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group) remains unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule will be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which can also be named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, which is an isomer of the sec-butyl group. This is incorrect.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is a different structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
