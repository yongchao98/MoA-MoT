    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the composition of A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFm. The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic mass of element Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * m * 19.00 = m * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = m * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = m * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * m\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m\n\n    We need to find an integer 'm' (the number of fluorine atoms) that results in a realistic atomic mass for an element Y that fits the described chemical properties.\n\n2.  **Evaluate chemical properties to constrain Y.**\n    *   **Five binary compounds with fluorine:** This suggests a transition metal, post-transition metal, or a halogen/noble gas with a wide range of oxidation states.\n    *   **A1 is bright-red, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C), and oxidizes xenon:** This points to a highly unstable fluoride of an element in a very high oxidation state. Compounds like PtF6, or fluorides of gold (Au) or certain actinides are known for such properties. A1 decomposing into A2 and F2 (A1 → A2 + F2) implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2.\n    *   Let's test potential values for 'm' from the mass calculation:\n        *   m=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.4 g/mol (like Ca, K, Ar): Unlikely chemistry.\n        *   m=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (like Br): Bromine has only 3 common fluorides (BrF, BrF3, BrF5). Doesn't fit.\n        *   m=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (like Sb): SbF5 is the highest fluoride and is not red, nor does it decompose in this manner.\n        *   m=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Lanthanides): Unlikely chemistry.\n        *   m=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol: This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0), Mercury (Hg, 200.6), Thallium (Tl, 204.4), Lead (Pb, 207.2), Bismuth (Bi, 209.0).\n\n3.  **Hypothesize Y = Au (Gold).**\n    Let's check if gold fits the chemical description, even if the mass calculation isn't perfect.\n    *   **Five fluorides:** Yes, AuF, AuF2, AuF3, AuF5, and the (possibly unstable/theoretical) AuF7 are known or have been reported. This fits.\n    *   **A1, A2:** The reaction A1 → A2 + F2 strongly suggests A1=AuF7 and A2=AuF5. AuF7 would be an extremely powerful oxidizer, capable of oxidizing Xenon. High-oxidation state gold compounds can be red. AuF5 is a red solid. This is a very strong fit for the chemical behavior.\n    *   Let's re-check ɷF for A2 = AuF5. M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol. M(AuF5) = 197.0 + 5*19.0 = 292.0 g/mol. ɷF = (5*19)/292 = 95/292 ≈ 32.5%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the discrepancy could be due to an error in the problem statement. The chemical evidence for Au is compelling.\n    *   **A3:** A3 is made by fluorinating Au. This could be AuF3 or AuF5. Both are strong Lewis acids and could interact with xenon species (e.g., AuF5 + XeF2 → [XeF][AuF6]). This fits.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    With Y=Au, the remaining fluorides for A4 and A5 are AuF, AuF2, and AuF3. Their approximate molecular weights are:\n    *   M(AuF) = 197 + 19 = 216 g/mol\n    *   M(AuF2) = 197 + 38 = 235 g/mol\n    *   M(AuF3) = 197 + 57 = 254 g/mol\n\n    The reaction is: **Y + A4 → A5** (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n    This translates to: **Au + A4 → A5**.\n    The statement \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\" is characteristic of disproportionation, which often happens with elements in intermediate oxidation states, like Au(I) or Au(II).\n\n    Let's test the comproportionation reaction: `x Au(0) + y Au(n) → (x+y) Au(m)`.\n    The molar ratio is 1:1, so x=1 and y=1. The reaction is: `Au(0) + AuF_n → 2 AuF_{n/2}`.\n    For the product to be a simple binary fluoride, n/2 must be an integer. This means n must be even.\n\n    *   Let's test `n=2`. A4 = AuF2.\n        *   The reaction becomes: **Au + AuF2 → 2 AuF**.\n        *   The reactants (Au and AuF2) are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This fits the problem description perfectly.\n        *   The product is A5 = AuF.\n        *   Does A5 (AuF) decompose in water? Yes, gold(I) disproportionates: `3AuF → 2Au(s) + AuF3(aq)`. This forms two substances (elemental gold and aqueous gold(III) fluoride). This also fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our consistent hypothesis, A4 is AuF2.\n    The molecular weight of A4 (AuF2) is M = 197 + 2*19 = 235 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Ranges.**\n    We need to find which range contains 235 g/mol.\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 235 falls squarely within the range 220-240.\n\n*(Note: The problem contains some inconsistencies, such as the exact fluorine percentage and the \"colorless\" nature of the A4 solution (Au(II) compounds are typically colored). However, the Gold hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation for the majority of the chemical transformations described, especially the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry and the decomposition of A5.)*\n\n<<<B>>>"
