    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt species in a solution and find the percentage of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)2].\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nWe have a central metal ion, Co²⁺, and a ligand, SCN⁻. They form a series of complexes in a stepwise manner:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β_n):\n*   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Define the Total Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe are given:\n*   c(Co) = 10⁻² M\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\nSince the concentration of the ligand [SCN⁻] (0.1 M) is much larger than the total concentration of the metal ion c(Co) (0.01 M), we can assume that the concentration of free SCN⁻ remains approximately constant at 0.1 M.\n\n**3. Express Concentrations in Terms of [Co²⁺]**\n\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstitute these into the total concentration equation:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nFactor out [Co²⁺]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. The fraction of this species (let's call it α₂) is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from above:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values to calculate α₂.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The numerator is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n>>>\npercentage=16.916180326482278\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] is approximately 0.16916, which corresponds to 16.916%.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The percentage of a specific complex in a solution can be determined by calculating its mole fraction (α) relative to all other species containing the central ion.\n\n**1. Define the Species and Equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, the ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂)**\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 1 and 2, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term appears in both the numerator and every term of the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n*   **Numerator:** β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n*   **Sum of Denominator:** 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
