    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($d$) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($d$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$):\n        $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the time dilation formula from special relativity:\n        $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n        where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is the ratio of the total energy ($E_X$) to the rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$):\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n    *   The momentum ($p$) of a relativistic particle is given by $p = \\gamma m_X v$.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    By substituting the expressions for $\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$ and $\\tau_0$ into the equation for $d$, we get:\n    $d = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0) = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n    We can simplify the term $v \\cdot \\gamma$. From the momentum relation $p = \\gamma m_X v$, we can write $v\\gamma = \\frac{p}{m_X}$.\n    So, the formula for the decay distance becomes:\n    $d = \\frac{p}{m_X} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n    For convenience in calculations involving particle physics units (MeV, GeV), it is standard to work with momentum-energy ($pc$) and mass-energy ($m_X c^2$). We can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Total energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass energy, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Decay width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n5.  **Look up Necessary Constants:**\n    *   The reduced Planck constant times the speed of light, $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the momentum term, $pc$.**\n        Use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n        Rearranging for $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.49 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    *   **Step 2: Substitute all values into the decay distance formula.**\n        $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        $d = \\frac{7909.49 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n        $d \\approx 6.5912 \\cdot 0.6166 \\text{ fm}$\n        $d \\approx 4.0636 \\text{ fm}$\n\n    *   **Step 3: Convert the result to meters.**\n        Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n        $d \\approx 4.0636 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value $4.0636 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is closest to option B, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The small difference is likely due to the precision of the constants used.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nhbar_c = 197.327  # MeV fm\nE_X = 8000.0  # MeV\nm_X_c2 = 1200.0  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Calculate pc using the relativistic energy-momentum relation\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance using the formula d = (pc / m_X_c^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\n# The result will be in femtometers (fm)\nd_fm = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert the distance from femtometers to meters (1 fm = 1e-15 m)\nd_m = d_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"{d_m}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **Decay Width ($\\Gamma_X$) and Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** The decay width of an unstable particle is related to its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle as observed in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation, a consequence of special relativity:\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance ($d$):** The mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}} = v \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nCombining the equations above:\n$d = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nWe can express the terms using the particle's energy and momentum, which is more convenient.\n*   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n*   The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m_X v$, which can be rearranged to $v\\gamma = \\frac{p}{m_X}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $d$:\n$d = \\frac{p}{m_X} \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nTo work consistently with particle physics units (MeV and GeV), we multiply the numerator and denominator by the speed of light, $c$:\n$d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m)\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the momentum term, $pc$.**\n    We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 7909.5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance, $d$.**\n    $d = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    $d = \\left( \\frac{7909.5 \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\right)$\n    $d \\approx (6.591) \\cdot (0.6166 \\text{ fm})$\n    $d \\approx 4.0645 \\text{ fm}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Convert to meters.**\n    Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, the distance is:\n    $d \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result was confirmed by the Python code execution, which yielded $4.06446753466184 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\n*   A) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n*   B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n*   C) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n*   D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value of approximately $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option B. The minor difference is likely due to the precision of constants used to generate the options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
