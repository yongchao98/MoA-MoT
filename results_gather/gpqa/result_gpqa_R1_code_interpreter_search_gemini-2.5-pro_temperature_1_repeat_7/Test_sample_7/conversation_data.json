    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Data:**\n    The first step is to list the phenotypes (resistance levels) for each genotype and compare them to the wild-type (control). The phenotype can be viewed as \"resistance level\" or its inverse, \"sensitivity/loss of resistance\".\n\n    *   Wild-Type (WT): 100% resistance (0% loss)\n    *   g1 (G1 knock-out): 75% resistance (25% loss)\n    *   g2 (G2 knock-out): 0% resistance (100% loss)\n    *   g3 (G3 knock-out): 50% resistance (50% loss)\n    *   g1g2 (double mutant): 0% resistance (100% loss)\n    *   g2g3 (double mutant): 0% resistance (100% loss)\n    *   g1g3 (double mutant): 10% resistance (90% loss)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The `g2` single mutant shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype.\n    *   The `g1g2` double mutant also has 0% resistance, which is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype. When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, this indicates an **epistatic** interaction. Here, `g2` is epistatic to `g1` (the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation).\n    *   Similarly, the `g2g3` double mutant has 0% resistance, identical to the `g2` single mutant. Therefore, `g2` is also epistatic to `g3`.\n    *   Because G2 is essential for resistance and its mutation masks the effects of mutations in G1 and G3, G2 likely functions in a critical, upstream step or a core pathway that is absolutely required for resistance.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF). A gene with such a central and epistatic role is the strongest candidate for being the TF. Thus, it is highly probable that **G2 is a transcription factor**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   Let's look at the phenotypes of the single mutants vs. the double mutant.\n        *   Loss from `g1` alone: 25%\n        *   Loss from `g3` alone: 50%\n        *   Expected loss if effects were additive: 25% + 50% = 75%.\n        *   Actual observed loss in `g1g3` double mutant: 90%.\n    *   Since the observed effect in the double mutant (90% loss) is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (75% loss), this is a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   Synergism often indicates that the two genes (G1 and G3) function in parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome. They have partially overlapping or related functions. This concept is known as **gene redundancy** (or more specifically, partial redundancy). If one gene is lost, the other can still partially perform the function, but when both are lost, the function is severely impaired.\n    *   Now, let's check for epistasis between G1 and G3. Is the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%)? No. Is it the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%)? No. Therefore, neither G1 is epistatic to G3, nor is G3 epistatic to G1.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: We cannot determine this. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but we only have data for one trait (resistance).\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Cannot be determined from this genetic experiment.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct. This is the most logical conclusion for G2's role.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This is the best description for the synergistic interaction observed.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. This contradicts the synergistic interaction. However, this option correctly identifies the two most important conclusions from the data.\n\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. G2 is the far more likely candidate due to its severe phenotype and epistatic effects.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Cannot be determined.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: Correct. This is a true statement based on the data.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    We must choose the best possible answer among the given options, even if they are flawed.\n    *   Option D correctly identifies one epistatic relationship (`G2` over `G1`) but incorrectly identifies the transcription factor. Misidentifying the central regulatory gene is a major error in interpretation.\n    *   Option C correctly identifies the most likely transcription factor (`G2`) and correctly describes the relationship between `G1` and `G3` (`gene redundancy`). It only fails on the final clause, which incorrectly claims epistasis between G1 and G3.\n    *   Comparing the options, Option C provides the most accurate and comprehensive picture of the genetic pathway, capturing two key correct interpretations versus Option D's one correct but less central point and one major incorrect point. The error in Option C is likely a mistake in the question's wording. Therefore, C is the best available answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
