    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to identify Compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals:\n    *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2, a CH₂ group). The 6H integration suggests two equivalent CH₃ groups. So, we have two `CH₃-CH₂-` fragments.\n    *   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3, a CH₃ group). The 4H integration suggests two equivalent CH₂ groups. So, we have two `-CH₂-CH₃` fragments.\n*   Combining these two pieces of information, we have two identical ethyl groups (CH₃CH₂-). The total number of protons is 6 + 4 = 10. The only way to arrange two ethyl groups into a symmetrical alkane with the formula C₄H₁₀ is butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   **Compound A is butane.**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. There are two possible products: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n*   We need to look at the next step to determine which isomer is formed.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction to form an alkene (Compound C).\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers (*cis* and *trans*).\n    *   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would only yield but-1-ene (CH₃CH₂CH=CH₂), which does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B is 2-bromobutane, elimination yields two products: but-2-ene (CH₃CH=CHCH₃, major) and but-1-ene (minor). But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, **Compound B must be 2-bromobutane**, and **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) acts as the dienophile.\n*   (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol acts as the diene.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, specifically a Diels-Alder reaction, which forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Connectivity and Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\n1.  **Connectivity:** The reaction joins C1 of the diene to one of the alkene carbons of the dienophile, and C4 of the diene to the other alkene carbon. A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n    *   Diene: HO-**C1**=**C2**-**C3**=**C4**-CH₃\n    *   Dienophile: CH₃-**C5**=**C6**-CH₃\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene ring with the structure `4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol`. The numbering here is based on IUPAC rules for the final product (C1 is the carbon with the -OH group, C2-C3 is the double bond). This matches the naming in options A and D.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific and generally follows the endo rule.\n    *   **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (on what will become C5 and C6 of the product) must be *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   **Diene Stereochemistry:** The diene is (1E,3E). For an (E,E)-diene, the two substituents on the ends (the -OH on C1 and the -CH₃ on C4) end up *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** The reaction proceeds through a transition state that is lower in energy. For this reaction, the endo transition state is favored. In the endo product, the substituents from the dienophile are *trans* to the \"outside\" substituents of the diene.\n        *   Let's establish the relative orientations. Let the two *cis* methyl groups from the dienophile be \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   The two *cis* substituents from the diene (-OH and -CH₃) must be *trans* to the dienophile's methyl groups. Therefore, the -OH and -CH₃ groups must be \"down\" (dash).\n\n3.  **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n    *   We have determined the relative stereochemistry for the endo product:\n        *   -OH on C1 (IUPAC): down (dash)\n        *   -CH₃ on C4 (IUPAC): down (dash)\n        *   -CH₃ on C5 (IUPAC): up (wedge)\n        *   -CH₃ on C6 (IUPAC): up (wedge)\n    *   Now we assign the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   **C1:** The priorities are OH > C2 > C6 > H. The H is \"up\" (wedge). The sequence 1-2-3 is clockwise (R). Since the lowest priority group is wedged, we reverse the configuration to **S**. -> **(1S)**.\n        *   **C4:** The priorities are C3 > C5 > CH₃ > H. The H is \"up\" (wedge). The sequence 1-2-3 is counter-clockwise (S). Since the lowest priority group is wedged, we reverse the configuration to **R**. -> **(4R)**.\n        *   **C5:** The priorities are C6 > C4 > CH₃ > H. The H is \"down\" (dash). The sequence 1-2-3 is counter-clockwise (S). Since the lowest priority group is dashed, we do not reverse. -> **(5S)**.\n        *   **C6:** The priorities are C1 > C5 > CH₃ > H. The H is \"down\" (dash). The sequence 1-2-3 is clockwise (R). Since the lowest priority group is dashed, we do not reverse. -> **(6R)**.\n\n*   The final predicted structure for compound D is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
