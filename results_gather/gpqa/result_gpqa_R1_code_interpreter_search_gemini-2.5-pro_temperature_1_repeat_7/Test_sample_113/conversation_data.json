    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. A nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one).\n    2.  **Mechanism:**\n        *   The cyanide ion, provided by NaCN, attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.\n        *   This negatively charged alkoxide ion needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, the cyanohydrin (which has a hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    3.  **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. In a laboratory setting, this is typically achieved by adding an acid. H₃O⁺ (the hydronium ion) is the general representation for an acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water). While adding strong acid directly to NaCN is hazardous (produces toxic HCN gas), the reaction is often carried out by mixing the ketone and NaCN, and then slowly adding acid. Thus, H₃O⁺ represents the necessary acid for the protonation step. NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite adducts, which is a different reaction.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires harsh conditions, meaning either a strong acid or a strong base with heat.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, in the presence of water, must facilitate this hydrolysis.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze a stable nitrile group.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. Heating a nitrile with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ is a standard method to hydrolyze it completely to a carboxylic acid.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n*   **Overall Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
