    "*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-). Since the compound is an acetate, this is the `CH3-C(=O)-O-` part of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `-CH-CH3` fragment where the CH is part of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:**\n    *   These signals are in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). They represent the two protons on the double bond, let's call them Ha and Hb.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is one of the vinylic protons (Ha).\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz** is very important. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent. A large J-value (typically 14-18 Hz) is characteristic of a **trans** relationship. A smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz) indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz clearly points to a *trans* double bond.\n        *   The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group (`-O-CH=`), which deshields the proton.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   This is the other vinylic proton (Hb).\n        *   The splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (Ha). The J-value for this coupling would be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** part arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (the one seen at 1.6 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-` (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n2.  We have a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm).\n3.  The `J = 16.0 Hz` value confirms the double bond has **trans** stereochemistry.\n4.  Putting the pieces together: The acetate group connects to the propenyl group to form `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3`.\n5.  This structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify it against the data:\n    *   `CH3(acetyl)-C(=O)-O-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`\n    *   `CH3(acetyl)`: Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n    *   `H(a)`: Vinylic H next to oxygen. Coupled to H(b). Expected to be a doublet and downfield. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`)\n    *   `H(b)`: Vinylic H next to methyl group. Coupled to H(a) (doublet) and CH3(c) (quartet) -> dq. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n    *   `CH3(c)`: Allylic methyl. Coupled to H(b). Expected to be a doublet. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n\n*   **Eliminating Other Options**\n\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate:** Would show a much smaller J-coupling constant (~6-12 Hz) between the vinylic protons.\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate:** These molecules have the formula C6H10O2, meaning they have 10 protons. The NMR data integration (1+1+3+3) sums to 8 protons. Therefore, the butenyl acetates are incorrect.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
