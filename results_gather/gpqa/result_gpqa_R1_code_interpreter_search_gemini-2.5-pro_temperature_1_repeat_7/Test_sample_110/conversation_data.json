    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a base (t-BuOK) to catalyze the enolate formation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor and enolate formation:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, the base must remove an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   Let's look at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-hydrogens.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C5. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one** α-hydrogen.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a hydrogen, the bulky base t-BuOK must deprotonate this position to form the enolate. There is no ambiguity or competition between kinetic and thermodynamic enolates.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack will occur at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n\n4.  **The Michael addition step:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the ketone attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The initial product is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated (likely by the conjugate acid of the base, t-BuOH, or during workup) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The new group attached to C6 of the ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt (a 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl group).\n    *   The product molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Now, we must match this structure to the IUPAC names given in the options. The options name the molecule as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   Parent name: `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. This means the ethyl propanoate chain is the base, and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment to the propanoate chain as C1.\n        *   The attachment point is the original **C6** of the ketone. This carbon also has a **methyl group**. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent on the ring.\n        *   The original carbonyl carbon **C1** is now **C2** in the substituent numbering. It has the oxo group. So, it's a **2-oxo** ring.\n        *   The original **C2** is now **C3**. It has both an **ethyl** and a **methyl** group. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane acts as the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael donor:**\n    *   1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂) has acidic protons on the carbon α to the nitro group (pKa ≈ 10). The base KOH deprotonates this carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:**\n    *   (E)-but-2-enenitrile (trans-CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is the α,β-unsaturated acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **The Michael addition step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate stabilized by the nitrile group, which is then protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the atoms to form the product:\n        *   The `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` group from 1-nitropropane attaches to the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n        *   The `CH₃-CH=CH₂-CN` skeleton becomes `CH₃-CH(Nu)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n              CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃\n              |\n        CH₃ - CH - CH₂ - CN\n        ```\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group (-CN). The nitrile carbon is C1.\n        ```\n           (6)   (5)    (4)         (3)    (2)   (1)\n        CH₃ - CH₂ - CH(NO₂) - CH - CH₂ - CN\n                                  |\n                                  CH₃\n        ```\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain from the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at position **C3**.\n    *   There is a **nitro** group at position **C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
