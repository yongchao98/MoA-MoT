    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\n\nThe electromagnetic field observed at a point `r` and time `t` is not caused by the charge's properties at time `t`, but by its properties at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. This is because the electromagnetic influence propagates at the speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time difference `t - tr` must be equal to the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n*   **Position of the charge at time t:** `s(t)`\n*   **Position of the charge at the retarded time tr:** `s(tr)`\n*   **Observation point:** `r`\n*   **Vector from the source (at tr) to the observation point:** `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **Distance from the source (at tr) to the observation point:** `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **Velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr:** `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`.\n*   **Retarded time condition:** `t - tr = d / c`\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials can be derived from the general retarded potential formulas for a time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J`:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals and performing the integration is a standard procedure in electrodynamics. The key challenge is that the retarded time `tr'` in the argument of the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration gives:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)]_ret`\n\nThe subscript `_ret` indicates that all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 3. Final Form of the Potentials\n\nTo match the form given in the options, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qcv / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`A(r, t) = μ₀qcv / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n\nNote that there is a useful relationship between the two potentials:\n`A(r, t) = (v / c²) * V(r, t)`\nThis can be verified using the relation `c² = 1 / (ε₀μ₀)`.\n\n### 4. Comparison with the Options\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(...) = ... / (dc + d⋅v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d⋅v)`:** The sign in the denominator is positive. This is incorrect based on the standard definition of the vector `d` (from source to observer) used in the problem statement.\n*   **B) `V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(...) = (v/c²)V(...)`:** This expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or retardation effects. Incorrect.\n*   **C) `V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r)`, `A(...) = (v²/c²)V(...)`:** This has the same incorrect `V` as option B, and the expression for `A` is dimensionally incorrect (A is a vector, v² is a scalar).\n*   **D) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`:** These expressions match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials exactly. The vector `v` is implied in the expression for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>"
