    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: For a signal to be split this way, the corresponding proton(s) must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a 1+1 = **doublet**)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3, gives a 3+1 = **quartet**)\n    This pattern typically arises from a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: Similarly, this pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a 1+1 = **doublet**)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a 2+1 = **triplet**)\n    This pattern typically arises from a methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe question states that the spectrum contains *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. We must now examine the structure of each candidate to see which one has protons in environments that would produce both of these specific patterns.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw and analyze each molecule. We will label the methine (CH) protons as they are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃  CH₃\n      |    |\nCH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n    (4)  (3)  (2)\n```\n\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- at C4 (2H, triplet), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (or dqt/tqd). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the -CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃  CH₃\n      |    |\nCH₃--CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n    (4)  (3)  (2)\n```\n\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to the -CH₂- at C2 (2H, triplet), H at C4 (1H, doublet), and the -CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq** (or dqt/dtq). This matches one requirement.\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet), the terminal -CH₃ (3H, quartet), and the -CH₃ on C4 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n      |    |\nCH₃-CH₂--CH--CH--COOH\n    (4)  (3)  (2)\n```\n\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the -CH₂- at C4 (2H, triplet), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the -CH₂- of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt**.\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n\nLet's parse this formula carefully. It represents: `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\nLet's number the chain according to IUPAC rules, starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n```\n      C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n      |    |\nCH₃--CH--CH--CH₂--COOH\n  (5) (4)  (3)  (2)   (1)\n```\n\nNow let's analyze the key methine protons, H at C3 and H at C4.\n\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The two protons on C2 (-CH₂-) → **triplet**\n    *   The single proton on C4 (-CH-) → **doublet**\n    *   The two protons on its attached ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) → **triplet**\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The three protons on C5 (-CH₃) → **quartet**\n    *   The single proton on C3 (-CH-) → **doublet**\n    *   The two protons on its attached ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) → **triplet**\n    The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCompound **D** is the only structure that has methine protons in environments that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
