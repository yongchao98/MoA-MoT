    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance of this peak is about 32% that of the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (Natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structures to see if they match. The general formula is CₓHᵧClO₂.\nFor C₇H₅ClO₂, the mass would be:\n(7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\nThis matches the M⁺ peak. All the given options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the carbonyl region and corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, which typically appears between 1730-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde and phenol) unlikely. We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in the very downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm), which is characteristic of a highly deshielded **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. It is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This further supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** There are two signals in the aromatic region, totaling 4 protons (2H + 2H = 4H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Two equivalent protons split into a doublet.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Another two equivalent protons split into a doublet.\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Signals:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts. Each set of two equivalent protons is split by the neighboring set, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   Its *para* substitution pattern would produce exactly the observed ¹H NMR aromatic signals: two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   The molecular weight matches the MS data.\n    *   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data.\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in an *ortho* (1,2) arrangement.\n    *   While it has a carboxylic acid group and the correct molecular weight, its substitution pattern is incorrect.\n    *   An *ortho*-disubstituted ring would have four unique aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The MS shows the correct mass and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak confirm the carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
