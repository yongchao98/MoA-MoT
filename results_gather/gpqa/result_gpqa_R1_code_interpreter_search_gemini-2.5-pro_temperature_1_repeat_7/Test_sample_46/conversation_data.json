    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms and a strong IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The fact that there are two doublets, each integrating to two protons, means the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, which is what you see in a para-substituted pattern (AA'BB' system that often appears as two doublets). The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 vs 8.0 ppm) suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons, combined with the IR data, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH₂) group. The chemical shift is typical for an aniline-type amine. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet at a downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is more consistent with an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) than an ether (-Ar-OCH₂CH₃, which would be closer to 4.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    3.  The -NH₂ group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it should be shielded (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    4.  The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it should be deshielded (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n    This assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR and the 2H integration of the amine signal.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. It is also an amide, not an ester.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and ¹H NMR).\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this structure, the ethyl group is part of a propionate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear much further upfield (around 2.2-2.5 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
