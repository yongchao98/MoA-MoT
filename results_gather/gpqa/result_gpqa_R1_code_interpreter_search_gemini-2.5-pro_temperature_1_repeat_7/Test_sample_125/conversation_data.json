    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (re and si faces). Since the existing chiral center at C5 is relatively far from the reacting C3 carbonyl, there is no significant steric influence to favor one side of attack over the other. Therefore, both possible configurations at C3, (R) and (S), will be formed in roughly equal amounts.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the two carbonyls creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups can lead to different combinations of stereoconfigurations at C2 and C4.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between the stereoisomers:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom and is therefore a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   (2S, 4R) is the mirror image of (2R, 4S), but because the molecule is meso, it is superimposable on (2R, 4S). Thus, they are the same compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)- or (2S, 4R)-)\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers. So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for interaction with chiral entities) and therefore cannot be separated on an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (and structurally different molecules in general) have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different properties, and will give a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ mono-alcohols with an ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with peaks from Reaction II.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Chiral columns can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   A chiral column will resolve all five of them.\n    1.  Peak for (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  Peak for (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  Peak for (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  Peak for (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  Peak for meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
