    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in relativistic mechanics. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (Pi+) is at rest.\n    *   Initial total energy (E_i) = Rest energy of the pion = `m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Initial momentum (p_i) = 0.\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu) are produced.\n    *   Final total energy (E_f) = Total energy of muon (E_mu) + Total energy of neutrino (E_nu).\n    *   Final momentum (p_f) = Momentum of muon (p_mu) + Momentum of neutrino (p_nu).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_i = p_f`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_i = E_f`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n**3. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos are considered massless in this context (`m_nu = 0`).\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0)^2` => `E_nu = p*c`\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`).\n    `KE_nu = p*c`\n\n**4. Solve for the Energies:**\n\nNow we can combine the equations. From the energy conservation equation:\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\nSubstitute `E_nu = p*c`:\n`p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\nNow substitute this expression for `p*c` into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n`E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the squared term:\n`E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `E_mu^2` term cancels on both sides. Rearrange to solve for `E_mu`:\n`2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n`E_mu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\nThis formula gives the total energy of the muon. We can now use the given mass values to calculate the kinetic energies.\n\nLet's use a Python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using the derived formula.\n# We are effectively working in units where c=1.\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# From conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n# m_pi = (KE_mu + m_mu) + KE_nu\n# So, KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_mu\nKE_nu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the muon (mu+) is 4.12 MeV.\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the neutrino (nu) is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (Pi+) is at rest. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). Both product particles are moving and thus have both kinetic energy (KE) and rest mass energy.\n    `E_final = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + E_nu`\n    (Note: The neutrino is considered massless, so its total energy `E_nu` is purely kinetic energy, `KE_nu`).\n\nEquating the initial and final energies:\n`m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + KE_nu`\n`KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`\nThis is the total kinetic energy released, also known as the Q-value of the decay.\n`KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n**2. Principle of Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero.\n    `p_initial = 0`\n*   **Final State:** The muon and neutrino move in opposite directions.\n    `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\nEquating the initial and final momenta:\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n`p_mu = -p_nu`\nThis means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe energy, momentum, and rest mass of a particle are related by: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   For the neutrino (massless, `m_nu = 0`):\n    `E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0`\n    `E_nu = p*c`\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: `KE_nu = p*c`.\n\n*   For the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    The total energy of the muon is `E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2`. Substituting this:\n    `(KE_mu + m_mu * c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe now have a system of equations. Let's solve for the kinetic energies.\n\nFrom step 3, we know `p*c = KE_nu`. Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n`(KE_mu + m_mu * c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 2*KE_mu*(m_mu*c^2) + (m_mu*c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(m_mu*c^2)^2` term cancels out:\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 2*KE_mu*(m_mu*c^2) = (KE_nu)^2`\n\nFrom the conservation of energy in step 1, we have `KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 2*KE_mu*(105.7) = (33.9 - KE_mu)^2`\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 211.4 * KE_mu = (33.9^2 - 2*33.9*KE_mu + (KE_mu)^2)`\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 211.4 * KE_mu = 1149.21 - 67.8 * KE_mu + (KE_mu)^2`\n\nThe `(KE_mu)^2` term cancels out. Now, solve for `KE_mu`:\n`211.4 * KE_mu + 67.8 * KE_mu = 1149.21`\n`279.2 * KE_mu = 1149.21`\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nThis rounds to **4.12 MeV** for the muon's kinetic energy.\n\nNow find the neutrino's kinetic energy:\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThis rounds to **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino's kinetic energy.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This corresponds to option A. The Python script confirmed these calculations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
