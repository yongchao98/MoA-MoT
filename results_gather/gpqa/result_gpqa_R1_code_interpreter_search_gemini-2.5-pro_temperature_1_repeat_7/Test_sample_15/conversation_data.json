    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each molecule for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The naming conventions used will help us determine this. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry (σ) or center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule contains a double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule. However, the name provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, unique stereoisomer.\n    *   The `R` and `S` designations indicate the presence of chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is a complex bridged system, and the substituents break any potential symmetry of the parent skeleton. It is not a meso compound.\n    *   Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it will be **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH).\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors are opposite: `(2R,3S)`.\n    *   A molecule with multiple chiral centers and identical substituents that has an R,S configuration (or S,R) is a **meso compound**. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral despite the presence of chiral centers.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is achiral. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   The stereochemical descriptors are the same: `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, so it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is non-standard. However, it likely refers to the relative stereochemistry. A similar standard notation is `(1r, 3c, 5c)`, where 'r' is a reference, and 'c' means cis. A notation like `(1s,3s,5s)` strongly suggests that all substituents have the same spatial relationship, meaning they are all `cis` to each other (all on the same side of the ring).\n    *   The `cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol` isomer is a highly symmetrical molecule. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and three planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We examine the molecule for chiral centers. There are none.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has planes of symmetry.\n        *   The 3-methylbutyl group has a carbon (C3) bonded to a hydrogen, a CH2 group, and two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry in certain conformations. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Active)\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Active)\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Active)\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
