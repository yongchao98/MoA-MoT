    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP. This is the immunogen.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This means the antigen will primarily encounter the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Observation 1:** Fluorescence is detected in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, a key site for initiating immune responses to gut antigens. This confirms the antigen has reached its target immune tissue.\n    *   **Observation 2:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these patches. Proliferation is a hallmark of lymphocyte activation after encountering an antigen. In the context of Peyer's patches, this strongly suggests B cells and T cells are responding to the rotavirus protein.\n    *   **Observation 3 (Crucial):** Sequencing the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these cells shows \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain gene (VH) is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibody it will secrete. This gene determines the antigen-binding specificity.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the options based on the observations.**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes like variability in the heavy chain gene. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within specialized structures called germinal centers (which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a very high rate specifically into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose is to create variants of the B cell receptor, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of proliferating B cells. This aligns perfectly with the observations.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut) but does not alter the antigen-binding site or create the observed variability in the variable region. While likely happening concurrently with SHM, it is not the process responsible for the specific observation described.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in *developing* B cells within the *primary* lymphoid organ (the bone marrow). This process happens *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. The experiment is observing an ongoing immune response in a *secondary* lymphoid organ after antigen stimulation. The variability seen here is being added to the initial diversity created by V(D)J recombination. Therefore, V(D)J recombination is not the process currently taking place.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude.**\n    The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating lymphocytes isolated from a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
