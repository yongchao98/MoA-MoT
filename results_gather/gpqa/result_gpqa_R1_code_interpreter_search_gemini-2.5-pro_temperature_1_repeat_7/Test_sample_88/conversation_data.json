    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to identify the class of compounds for Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at high temperature (240°C) to give Product 1. The IR spectrum of Product 1 shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. The provided ¹H NMR data (totaling 14H) and the starting material (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂) suggest that Product 1 has the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O. This corresponds to a tricyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantone. While the provided NMR data (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is unusual for a simple adamantone, the most plausible and known reaction under these conditions involves a rearrangement to form a ketone with a protoadamantane skeleton, specifically **protoadamantan-4-one**. Another possibility is the formation of **adamantan-2-one**. We will consider both possibilities.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The heating suggests a subsequent reaction. The fact that Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the next step is a crucial clue.\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to form two carbonyl groups.\n\n*   **Connecting the steps:** For Product 2 to react with ozone, it must contain a C=C double bond. However, the MPV reduction of Product 1 (a ketone) should yield an alcohol. The most logical explanation is that the initial reduction of the ketone to an alcohol is followed by a heat- and Lewis acid-catalyzed (from Al(O-iPr)₃) dehydration to form an alkene.\n    *   So, the sequence is: **Ketone (1) → Alcohol → Alkene (2) → Dicarbonyl (3)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2 (the alkene).**\n\n*   Let's follow the reaction from the plausible starting ketones:\n    *   **Path A:** If Product 1 is **adamantan-2-one**, it would be reduced to adamantan-2-ol. Dehydration of adamantan-2-ol is known to proceed with rearrangement to avoid forming a highly strained bridgehead alkene. The product of this rearrangement is **protoadamantene**.\n    *   **Path B:** If Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one**, it would be reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. Dehydration of this alcohol would also lead to an alkene with a protoadamantane skeleton, i.e., **protoadamantene**.\n\n*   Therefore, both plausible pathways converge on the same structure for Product 2: **protoadamantene** (specifically, an isomer like protoadamant-4-ene, tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 (the ozonolysis product).**\n\n*   Product 3 is formed by the ozonolysis of protoadamantene. This reaction cleaves the double bond within the protoadamantane framework. The established product of the ozonolysis of protoadamantene (with reductive workup) is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n*   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ). It has a bicyclic core made of two six-membered rings, with two aldehyde groups (-CHO) at the 3 and 7 positions.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3 to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton.**\n\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n*   **Most deshielded proton:** The protons that will exchange with a deuterated solvent are the aldehyde protons (-CHO). We exclude these. The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are those on the carbons bearing the aldehyde groups, i.e., the methine protons at C3 and C7 (let's call them H3 and H7). These are alpha to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n*   **Coupling analysis of H3:** Let's analyze the splitting pattern for H3 (the pattern for H7 will be identical due to symmetry).\n    *   H3 is on a carbon (C3) that is bonded to two other carbons, C2 and C4. Each of these is a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   Therefore, H3 is coupled to four neighboring protons: two on C2 and two on C4.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists preferentially in a rigid chair-chair conformation. In this conformation, the protons on C2 and C4 can be distinguished as axial and equatorial.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H3 to the two axial neighbors (H2ₐₓ and H4ₐₓ) will be identical. Let's call this coupling constant Jₐₓ. Based on the Karplus curve, this axial-axial coupling will be large.\n    *   Similarly, the coupling of H3 to the two equatorial neighbors (H2ₑₗ and H4ₑₗ) will be identical. Let's call this coupling constant Jₑₗ. This axial-equatorial coupling will be small.\n    *   Since Jₐₓ and Jₑₗ are significantly different, the signal for H3 will be split by two sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   The two axial protons will split the H3 signal into a **triplet** (with coupling constant Jₐₓ).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet will be further split into a **triplet** by the two equatorial protons (with coupling constant Jₑₗ).\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H3/H7) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
