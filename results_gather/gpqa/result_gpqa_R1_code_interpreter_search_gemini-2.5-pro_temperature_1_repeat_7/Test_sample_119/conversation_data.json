    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a volume of space:** Let's think about the number of stars at a certain distance `d` from us. We can imagine a thin spherical shell centered on Earth with radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4 * π * d^2`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = A * dd = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in this shell:** Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** The question asks for the distribution in terms of parallax, not distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For simplicity (and by convention in astronomy), we use the relationship:\n    `plx = 1 / d`  which implies `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Relate the intervals `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to express the small distance interval `dd` in terms of a small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `d = 1 / plx = plx^(-1)`\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 * plx^(-2) = -1 / plx^2`\n    So, `dd = - d(plx) / plx^2`.\n\n    The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are considering the *number* of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval. So, we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = d(plx) / plx^2`.\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the star count equation:** Now we replace the distance-based terms in our equation for `dN` with parallax-based terms.\n    Our starting equation was: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1 / plx` and `dd = d(plx) / plx^2`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx)^2 * (d(plx) / plx^2)`\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx^2) * (d(plx) / plx^2)`\n    Combine the terms:\n    `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Determine the proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n    **`dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`**\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
