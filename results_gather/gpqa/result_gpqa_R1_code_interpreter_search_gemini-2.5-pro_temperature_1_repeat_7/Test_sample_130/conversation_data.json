    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data are key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in a vinylic or aromatic environment.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene/aromatic region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region).\n        *   The only simple structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This results in one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, with chemical shifts matching the data provided. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene, perfect for a Diels-Alder reaction. The structure is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at position 5 and methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is typically the major product, formed via a transition state with stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. The *exo* adduct is the minor product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Structures and NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene core structure.\n        *   Methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3).\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the C5-C6 bridge.\n        *   The C7 position is a CH₂ bridge.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry (a plane bisecting the C2=C3 and C5-C6 bonds), we can predict the ¹H NMR signals:\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (on C1, C4):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to saturated, quaternary carbons. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a relatively low chemical shift, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (on C2, C3):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to a double bond. They will appear as a **6H singlet** at a higher shift than the bridgehead methyls, typically **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (on C5, C6):** These two methine protons are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a significantly higher shift, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (on C7):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely form a complex pattern (an AB quartet), not a simple singlet.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY shows through-space correlations between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** and **absent in the minor product**. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry:\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) to the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the protons on the anhydride bridge (H5, H6) are in the *exo* position (pointing away from the C7 bridge). The vinylic methyl groups (on C2, C3) are also on the \"top\" or *exo* face of the bicyclic system. Because the *exo*-protons (H5, H6) and the vinylic methyls are on the same face of the molecule, they are spatially close. **A NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this case, the protons on the anhydride bridge (H5, H6) are in the *endo* position (pointing towards the C7 bridge). The vinylic methyls remain on the *exo* face. Now, the anhydride protons (*endo*) and the vinylic methyls (*exo*) are on opposite faces of the molecule and are far apart. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak observed only in the major product connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride methine protons.\n    *   Matching this to our signal assignments:\n        *   Vinylic methyls: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n        *   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
