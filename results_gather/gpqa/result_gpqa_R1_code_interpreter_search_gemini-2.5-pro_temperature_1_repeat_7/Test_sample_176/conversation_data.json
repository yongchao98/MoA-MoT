    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2, which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the formula $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max}$). The formula is $T = b / \\lambda_{max}$, where b is Wien's constant. This law applies to the wavelength emitted by the star in its own rest frame ($\\lambda_{em}$).\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is different from the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$). For a source moving with a radial velocity $v_r$ (where $v_r << c$, the speed of light), the relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$. By convention, a positive $v_r$ indicates the source is moving away (redshift), and a negative $v_r$ indicates it is moving closer (blueshift).\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars and taking their ratio, we get:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Ratios:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    *   Therefore, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   The temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$). From Wien's law, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{em}$, so $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$). So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   We need to relate the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength for each star using the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_{r1} = 0$. This means there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Assuming this positive velocity indicates recession (redshift), the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted one: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the expressions equal: $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths: $\\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   This means the temperature ratio is $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    Now, we plug in the values:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n    We can compute this precise value using a short python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given ratios\nR_ratio_squared = 1.5**2\nv_r2 = 700.0  # km/s\nc = 299792.458  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the v/c ratio\nv_over_c = v_r2 / c\n\n# From the Doppler shift and Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n# The fourth power of the temperature ratio is (1 / (1 + v/c))^4\nT_ratio_term = (1 / (1 + v_over_c))**4\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = R_ratio_squared * T_ratio_term\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n2.22908323212873\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 2.229. This is closest to option C. The information about the masses of the stars is extra information not needed for this calculation, acting as a distractor.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning for this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 ($L_1/L_2$):\n    $L_1/L_2 = (4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$, so the ratio of their radii is $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Therefore, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law and Temperature:** The temperature of a star is related to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation ($\\lambda_{em}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{em}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak emitted wavelength, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{em}$.\n    The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. However, the temperature depends on the *emitted* wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$), which can be different from the observed one due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). The relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Finding the Emitted Wavelength Ratio:**\n    *   For Star 1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{em,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since the problem states that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can equate the two expressions:\n        $\\lambda_{em,1} = \\lambda_{em,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Rearranging this gives us the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n7.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{em,2} / \\lambda_{em,1}$, we have:\n    $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1/L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    $L_1/L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n    The calculation was performed by the Python script, yielding a result of approximately 2.2291.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2 \\approx 2.2291$. Comparing this value to the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.35\n    The result is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
