    "Here's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct synthesis sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down its structure:\n    *   A benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position C1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position C2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to the competing directing effects of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthesis Strategies (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Final step is Nitration?** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. Both the -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho/para directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, nitration is likely not the last step.\n    *   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (t-butylation)?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, making Friedel-Crafts reactions extremely difficult, if not impossible. So, this is not a viable last step.\n    *   **Final step is Etherification?** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This can be converted to the target ethoxy ether via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., using NaOH and ethyl bromide/EtBr). This is a very common and high-yield reaction. This suggests the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Phenol Intermediate (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):**\n    *   This phenol is often made from the corresponding aniline, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**, via diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (boiling in acidic water, H3O+/Heat).\n    *   So, the key challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Provided Options by Elimination:**\n    Let's examine the sequence of reactions in each option. A key principle is that certain reactions require specific functional groups. For example, diazotization (using NaNO2/HCl) requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). This amine is typically formed by reducing a nitro group (-NO2) with reagents like Fe/HCl.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `...iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...` This attempts to diazotize a nitro-compound, which is impossible. Incorrect.\n    *   **Option C:** `...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...` This attempts diazotization (step iv) long before the necessary amine group is formed (step viii). Impossible. Incorrect.\n    *   **Option D:** `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This correctly forms an amine (iv) and diazotizes it (v), but then attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt (vi). Diazonium salts are unstable and would decompose or be replaced under these conditions, not nitrated. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option B):**\n    By elimination, Option B must be the correct answer. Let's analyze its sequence to understand how it works, acknowledging that such complex multi-step synthesis problems in multiple-choice format can sometimes contain obscure steps or typos. The sequence presented in the prompt is:\n    `B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\n    The sequence of the last two steps (sulfonation followed immediately by desulfonation on the final product) is nonsensical and highly indicative of a typo in the question's transcription. A logical synthesis would not include these steps at the end. If we ignore these likely erroneous last two steps, we are left with a plausible core sequence (i-vii). Let's see if it can lead to the target product.\n\n    *   **Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene** -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-Butylbenzene** -> This gives a mixture of **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** and **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The para isomer is major due to sterics, but for this synthesis to work, the minor ortho isomer is required. We must proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Step iii: Fe/HCl on o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** -> Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 on o-tert-butylaniline** -> This is the crucial, regiochemistry-determining step. We need to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. In o-tert-butylaniline, the -NH2 group (a strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3 and 5, while the -tBu group (a weak o,p-director) directs to 4 and 6. The powerful -NH2 group's directing effect dominates. While position 3 is sterically hindered by the adjacent t-butyl group, forcing conditions or specific reaction subtleties can lead to substitution at this position. This step is the key to the entire synthesis.\n    *   **Step v: NaNO2/HCl on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** -> Diazotization of the primary amine to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt** -> Hydrolysis replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr on the phenol** -> Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, giving the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    This pathway is chemically sound, provided that the nitration in step (iv) yields the required (though perhaps minor) 3-nitro isomer. Given that options A, C, and D are definitively incorrect based on fundamental reaction principles, option B represents the only plausible, albeit challenging, synthetic route among the choices. The nonsensical steps viii and ix should be regarded as typos.\n\n<<<B>>>"
