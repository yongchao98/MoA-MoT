    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an element of axial or planar chirality. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the central C-C single bond is hindered. In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to chirality if the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6). Due to the restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses axial chirality and is therefore optically active.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester with the formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n        *   **Chirality:** We look for a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. Two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Chirality:** We check for elements of symmetry. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds **1** (due to atropisomerism) and **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct choice is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
