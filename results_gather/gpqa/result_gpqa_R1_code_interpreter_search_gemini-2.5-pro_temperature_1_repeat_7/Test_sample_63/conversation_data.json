    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each experimental step:**\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced during the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change. This indicates that no acidic gases that would cause a mass change (like CO₂, SO₂, or even NO₂) were present in the gas mixture.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxidizing agents. The problem states that CuO is formed, meaning the copper was oxidized. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper. The source of this oxygen must be an oxidizing gas from the decomposition.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that does not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the products from the experimental data:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Mass = 3.60 g\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol\n\n    *   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms added to copper = 0.80 g\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n        *   The oxidizing gas must be a compound that can provide these oxygen atoms. Common examples from salt decomposition are O₂ or N₂O.\n            *   If the gas was O₂, moles of O₂ would be 0.05 mol O / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n            *   If the gas was N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Moles of N₂O would be equal to the moles of O atoms, so 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n\n    *   **Gas C:**\n        *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP\n        *   Molar volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n        *   Gas C is what remains after all reactions. It must be an inert gas, likely nitrogen (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n3.  **Formulate and test a hypothesis for the identities of salts A and B:**\n    *   The products contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. This suggests the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, like ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n        *   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   The decomposition reactions are:\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) --(heat)--> N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) --(heat)--> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   This set of reactions produces N₂O, N₂, and H₂O. Let's see if it fits the data. The oxidizing gas would be N₂O, and the inert gas would be N₂.\n\n4.  **Verify the hypothesis with the mole calculations:**\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let's say we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   According to the reactions:\n        *   Moles of N₂O produced = `n`\n        *   Moles of N₂ produced = `n`\n        *   Moles of H₂O produced = 2`n` (from NH₄NO₃) + 2`n` (from NH₄NO₂) = 4`n`\n    *   Now, let's connect this to our experimental results:\n        *   The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms came from N₂O. Since there is one O atom per N₂O molecule, moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. Therefore, **`n` = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   Let's check the other products.\n            *   Moles of H₂O should be 4`n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n            *   The gas C is the inert N₂ from the decomposition *plus* the N₂ formed from the reduction of N₂O in Tube №3.\n            *   Initial N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition = `n` = 0.05 mol.\n            *   N₂ from N₂O reduction (N₂O → N₂ + O) = moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol.\n            *   Total moles of N₂ (Gas C) = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches our calculation for Gas C.\n    *   The hypothesis is consistent with all the data.\n\n5.  **Verify the initial mass of the mixture:**\n    *   We have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.05 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.008*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.05 g/mol\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (80.05 g/mol + 64.05 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.10 = 7.205 g.\n    *   This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the total atoms in one formula unit of each salt combined.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 (from A) + 8 (from B) = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n```python\n# Molar mass calculations and mass verification\nmolar_mass_nh4no3 = 2 * 14.007 + 4 * 1.008 + 3 * 15.999\nmolar_mass_nh4no2 = 2 * 14.007 + 4 * 1.008 + 2 * 15.999\nmoles_of_each = 0.05\ntotal_mass = moles_of_each * (molar_mass_nh4no3 + molar_mass_nh4no2)\n\n# Atom counting\natoms_in_nh4no3 = 2 + 4 + 3\natoms_in_nh4no2 = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_nh4no3 + atoms_in_nh4no2\n\nprint(f\"The calculated total mass is {total_mass:.2f} g, which matches the given 7.20 g.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of atoms in the formulas of NH4NO3 and NH4NO2 is {total_atoms}.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a CaCO₃ precipitate) or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the copper was oxidized by an oxygen-containing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Gas C:** The remaining gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This gas must be relatively inert, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Gases and Deduce the Composition of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The decomposition products are H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C (likely N₂).\n    *   This combination of products (H₂O, N₂, and an oxidizing nitrogen oxide) is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n    *   Their decomposition reactions are:\n        *   **NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n        *   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis with the Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The oxidizing gas is Nitrous Oxide (N₂O). It reacts with the hot copper in Tube №3:\n        *   **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**\n    *   From this reaction, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms to form CuO. Since we have 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, we must have had **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let `n` be the moles of each salt.\n        *   From the decomposition of NH₄NO₃, moles of N₂O = moles of NH₄NO₃. So, **n = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   This means the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n4.  **Check if this matches the other products:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   From NH₄NO₃: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   From NH₄NO₂: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol**. This matches our calculation from Tube №1.\n\n    *   **Gas C (Final N₂):**\n        *   From NH₄NO₂ decomposition: n = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n        *   From the reaction of N₂O with Cu: Moles of N₂ produced = moles of N₂O reacted = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n        *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = 0.05 + 0.05 = **0.10 mol**. This matches our calculation for the remaining gas.\n\n5.  **Check the Total Initial Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.2 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = **7.20 g**. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The hypothesis is confirmed. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
