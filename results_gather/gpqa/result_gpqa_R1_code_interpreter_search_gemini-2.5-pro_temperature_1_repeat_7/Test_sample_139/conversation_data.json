    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling, common in chemistry, often involving deuterium (D, or ²H) as a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2: Melting point of B is ~277 K.** The Kelvin scale is used. 277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This implies that G is a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₓ), which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** The reaction is violent and produces a gas, which is characteristic of reactive hydrides/deuterides with a protic substance like water.\n    *   **Clue 5: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's consider some simple gases.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Yes.**\n        *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. No.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but less likely from the context.\n        Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible gas is D₂.\n    *   **Clue 6: Reconstructing the reaction.** If the gas W is D₂, it must be formed from a reaction involving deuterium. A simple way to produce D₂ is to react a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻ ions or polarized D atoms) with a deuterium source like heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        The reaction would be: `Substance X (a deuteride) + D₂O (liquid Y) -> D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate G)`. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying Substance X.** We have two more clues for X.\n        *   \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly points to common reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. Both are common reagents.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduce both functional groups to alcohols. A ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OH), and a carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂-OH). The starting keto acid has two oxygen atoms, and the resulting product, a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), also has two oxygen atoms. This reaction works with LiAlD₄ but not with weaker hydrides.\n    *   **Conclusion for X:** All clues converge on **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   It contains a heavy isotope (D).\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a major organic reagent.\n        *   It reacts violently with D₂O (Y) to produce D₂ (W) and Al(OD)₃ (part of G). `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G.\n        *   Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n        *   It reduces a keto acid to a diol, preserving the number of oxygen atoms (two).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We compare the elements by atomic number or atomic mass to find the lightest and heaviest.\n        *   Li: Z=3, Mass ≈ 7 amu\n        *   Al: Z=13, Mass ≈ 27 amu\n        *   D (isotope of H): Z=1, Mass ≈ 2 amu\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to calculate the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D = ²H (mass = 2) and Al = ²⁷Al (mass = 27).\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = Mass from Al + Mass from D = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
