    "Annihilation is a process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles, such as photons or in this case, A mesons. To solve this problem, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this usually implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. The most straightforward scenario that conserves momentum is that the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest in the center-of-mass frame before they annihilate. Therefore, the initial momentum of the system is zero, and the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n\n    *   Initial Momentum: $P_{initial} = 0$\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$): This is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass.\n        $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 m_{p}c^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. The problem gives the rest mass energy of these particles as $m_{A}c^{2}=300 \\text{ MeV}$. We assume $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ have the same mass $m_A$. The total energy in the final state is the sum of the rest mass energies and the kinetic energies of these four particles.\n\n    *   Final Energy ($E_{final}$): $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\text{Energy of one A particle})$\n    *   Let $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A. Then $E_{final} = 4 E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 m_{p}c^2 = 4 E_A$\n        This implies that the energy of each final particle A is:\n        $E_A = \\frac{2 m_{p}c^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{p}c^2$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before is zero, so the total momentum after must also be zero. This means the vector sum of the momenta of the four A particles is zero. Due to the symmetry of the problem (four identical-mass particles produced), we can assume that the total available kinetic energy is shared equally among them, and thus they all have the same speed, $v$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    We have two expressions for the total energy of a single particle A:\n    a) From conservation of energy: $E_A = \\frac{1}{2} m_{p}c^2$\n    b) From relativistic mechanics: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n    Equating these two gives:\n    $\\gamma m_A c^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_{p}c^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{m_{p}c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\n    Now, we need the values for the rest mass energies:\n    *   $m_{A}c^{2} = 300 \\text{ MeV}$ (given)\n    *   $m_{p}c^{2}$ (rest mass energy of a proton) $\\approx 938.272 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    Let's calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.272 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.272}{600} \\approx 1.56378$\n\n    Finally, we can find the velocity $v$ from the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$. The relationship is:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Plugging in the value for $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    Thus, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$. This corresponds to option D.\n\nWe can use a python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27208816  # Proton rest mass energy in MeV (CODATA 2018)\nm_A_c2 = 300.0         # Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\n\n# From conservation of energy, the total energy of one particle A is E_A = (2 * m_p_c2) / 4\nE_A = (2 * m_p_c2) / 4\n\n# The total energy of a relativistic particle is also E_A = gamma * m_A_c2\n# So, gamma = E_A / m_A_c2\ngamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n# Now, solve for beta (v/c) from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity (v/c): {beta:.4f}\")\n```\n<execution_outputs>\nLorentz factor (gamma): 1.5638\nVelocity (v/c): 0.7688\n</execution_outputs>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis:**\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. To conserve momentum (which must be zero if the initial particles are nearly at rest), we consider the annihilation to occur in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero.\n*   The total energy of the initial state ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis:**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   We are given that the rest mass energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The total energy of the final state ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles. By conservation of energy, $E_{final} = E_{initial}$.\n*   Since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. Due to symmetry, the total available energy will be shared equally among the four resulting particles.\n*   The energy of each individual particle A ($E_A$) is therefore:\n    $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Velocity:**\n*   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   For one of the A particles, we have:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n*   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Finally, we solve for the velocity $v$ using the definition of $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\implies \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution. Comparing our result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
