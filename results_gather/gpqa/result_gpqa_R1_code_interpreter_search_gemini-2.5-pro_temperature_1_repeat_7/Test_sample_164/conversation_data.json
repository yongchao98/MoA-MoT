    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Scenario:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Ethylene only.\n    *   **Initial Product:** High-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is a linear polymer.\n    *   **Goal:** Introduce regular branches into the polymer backbone.\n    *   **Method:** Add a second catalyst system to the existing one.\n    *   **Implied Chemistry:** To create branches from only ethylene, the second catalyst must first oligomerize ethylene into short-chain alpha-olefins (e.g., 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene). Then, the primary catalyst (or the second one) copolymerizes ethylene with these newly formed alpha-olefins. This is known as tandem catalysis or in-situ comonomer generation. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is this oligomerization.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Statement:**\n\n    *   **Statement C: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n        *   Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n        *   Chromium-based catalysts are famously effective and highly selective for the trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene or tetramerization to 1-octene. These are the ideal comonomers to introduce regular C4 or C6 branches, respectively.\n        *   These catalyst systems require a metal source (e.g., a Cr salt), specific ligands (e.g., PNP-type ligands - phosphine-amine-phosphine), and an activator/co-catalyst.\n        *   Therefore, this statement accurately describes the most common and successful approach for the required oligomerization step. This statement is correct.\n\n    *   **Statement B: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n        *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene.\n        *   The aforementioned chromium-based catalysts are typically activated by aluminum-based compounds, most commonly methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), or other aluminum alkyls like triisobutylaluminum (TIBA).\n        *   These activators are not just optional; they are crucial for generating the active catalytic species. Far from \"not working,\" they are essential for the reaction to proceed efficiently.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect.\n\n    *   **Statement D: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n        *   Technology for producing Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) from a single ethylene feedstock using dual-catalyst systems in a single reactor does exist and is commercialized.\n        *   Companies like Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil, based in the US) have developed and licensed such technologies (e.g., within their UNIPOL™ PE process). These systems generate the comonomer in-situ.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is also factually correct.\n\n    *   **Statement A: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n        *   Noble metals include palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), etc. Some late transition metals, including palladium, have been shown to catalyze ethylene oligomerization.\n        *   Noble metals are, by definition, very expensive, making them economically unviable for producing a bulk commodity polymer like polyethylene.\n        *   So, on the surface, this statement appears to be correct.\n\n3.  **Resolve the Ambiguity (Multiple Correct Answers):**\n    *   We have identified that statements A, C, and D are likely correct, while B is definitively incorrect. In a single-choice question, there should be only one correct answer. This suggests we need to find the *best* or *most accurate* statement, or find subtle inaccuracies in the others.\n    *   **Comparing C and D:** Statement C describes the fundamental chemistry required (\"how to do it\"). Statement D describes the commercial status of the technology (\"it has been done\"). In the context of a scientific question about the \"formation of a polymer,\" the statement about the chemical method (C) is more fundamental and directly relevant than the one about industrial implementation (D).\n    *   **Re-evaluating D:** The industrial processes (like UNIPOL) are typically gas-phase processes using *heterogeneous* catalysts (where the catalytic components are supported on a solid particle like silica). The scientist in the question is working with a *homogeneous* catalyst system. While the general concept is the same, the practical implementation is different. This difference between the scientist's homogeneous system and the industrial heterogeneous systems could be seen as a subtle inaccuracy, making statement D less applicable to the scientist's specific situation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Statement C provides a direct, fundamentally correct, and universally applicable chemical principle for solving the scientist's problem. Statement B is factually wrong. Statements A and D, while appearing correct, have potential contextual inaccuracies or are less fundamental than C. Statement C is the most robust and accurate piece of chemical advice among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
