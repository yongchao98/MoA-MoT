    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves the equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation of this complex is represented by the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]_{initial}$, is 0.02 M.\n    *   The formation constant (also known as stability constant), $K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$, is $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The question assumes ideal pH and a temperature of 25 °C. This means we can use the given formation constant directly without considering the effects of pH on the EDTA species (i.e., we assume the EDTA is predominantly in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form).\n\n3.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant, $K_f$, is defined by the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n4.  **Consider the Dissociation:** The free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in the solution come from the slight dissociation of the $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n5.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n7.  **Make a Simplifying Assumption:** Because the formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can assume that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n8.  **Solve for x:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** From the ICE table, we know that the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# Using the approximation: K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves the equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation of this complex is a reversible reaction. Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of free ions, we should consider the dissociation reaction.\n\n2.  **Write the Dissociation Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Relate Formation Constant ($K_f$) to Dissociation Constant ($K_d$):** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which corresponds to the formation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-10} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can assume that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n8.  **Solve for x:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, take the square root of both sides to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** From the ICE table, the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This value corresponds to option D.\n\nWe can verify this calculation with a short Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Stoichiometric concentration of the complex\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n# Formation constant\nK_f = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so we can approximate:\n# K_f ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# Rearranging for x^2:\n# x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n# x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation.

    "The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\n1.  **The Dissociation Reaction**: The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates according to the following equilibrium:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: We are given the formation constant, $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations at equilibrium. We start with 0.02 M of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions that form upon dissociation.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Equilibrium Expression**:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplification**: Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the equilibrium lies strongly to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Solving for x**: The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, we take the square root to find x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\ M$\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option D. The previous code execution confirmed this calculation ($6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$).\n\n<<<D>>>"
