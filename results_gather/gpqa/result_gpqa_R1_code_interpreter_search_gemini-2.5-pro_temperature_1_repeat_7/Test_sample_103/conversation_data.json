    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    *   Therefore, K ∝ Δλ_max.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:** We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Δλ_max1 = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   Δλ_max2 = 7 miliangstrom\n    *   The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n        K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max2 / Δλ_max1 = 7 / 5\n\n4.  **Find the Physical Formula for K:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a star with an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) * ( mₚ sin(i) / (Mₛ + mₚ)^(2/3) )\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the orbital plane's normal).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n5.  **Identify Constants and Variables:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: mₚ₁ = mₚ₂.\n    *   The problem does not specify the inclinations. In such cases, we assume the viewing geometry is the same for both systems (i₁ = i₂). This is a standard simplifying assumption required to find a unique numerical answer.\n    *   G and 2π are universal constants.\n\n6.  **Establish the Proportionality:** Since mₚ, Mₛ, and sin(i) are the same for both systems, all terms in the formula for K are constant except for the period, P. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    *   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n7.  **Set up the Ratio for the Periods:** Using the proportionality, we can relate the ratios of K and P:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂/P₁):** We need to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We can rearrange the equation from the previous step:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂ )³\n\n9.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:** Now, we substitute the ratio of the K values we found in step 3:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5  =>  K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1\n# P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3\n# From the problem statement, K is proportional to the wavelength shift.\n# K1 is proportional to 5 miliangstrom.\n# K2 is proportional to 7 miliangstrom.\n# So, K1/K2 = 5/7.\n\nratio_P2_over_P1 = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_output>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.\n\n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1.96\n    *   B) ~ 0.85\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 1.40\n\nOur calculated value of ~0.364 matches option C. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter). This makes physical sense, as the larger velocity wobble for planet #2 implies a stronger gravitational interaction, which often corresponds to a closer and therefore faster orbit.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂/P₁).\n\n**1. Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\n*   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\nWe are given:\n*   Δλ_max₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n*   Δλ_max₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n*   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 / 5\n\n**2. Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is given by the formula:\n\nK = ( (2πG / P)^(1/3) ) * ( mₚ sin(i) / (Mₛ + mₚ)^(2/3) )\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n*   Mₛ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the orbital inclination.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n**3. Simplify the Relationship**\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n*   The planets have the same mass (mₚ₁ = mₚ₂).\n\nWe assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)), as is standard when this information is not provided. Since all other terms (G, 2π, mₚ, Mₛ, sin(i)) are constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n\n*   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the Period Ratio**\n\nFrom the proportionality, we can write the ratio:\n\n*   K₂ / K₁ = (1 / P₂^(1/3)) / (1 / P₁^(1/3)) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find P₂ / P₁. We can rearrange the equation by cubing both sides and then taking the reciprocal:\n\n*   (K₂ / K₁)³ = P₁ / P₂\n*   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, we substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 1:\n\n*   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
