    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the final product (Product 4).**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexan-1-one. The reaction typically occurs at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   Product 1 is an α-halo ketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position). When treated with a strong base like NaOH and heated, such compounds undergo a characteristic reaction called the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   The mechanism involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one), which is then attacked by the hydroxide ion (OH⁻). The resulting intermediate undergoes ring-opening to form the most stable carbanion, which leads to a ring contraction.\n    *   The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. (Initially formed as its sodium salt, but implicitly protonated before the next step).\n\n3.  **Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n4.  **Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃), forming product 4.**\n    *   Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4.**\n\n*   **Product 4 is Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.** Its structure consists of a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n\n*   To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the rest of the ring.\n\n*   Let's count the sets of equivalent hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n    1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **1** type of hydrogen.\n    2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This is the hydrogen on the same carbon as the aldehyde group. It is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **1** type of hydrogen.\n    3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are adjacent to C1 and are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Each of these carbons has two hydrogens. The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (one is 'cis' and one is 'trans' relative to the aldehyde group). The same is true for the two hydrogens on C5. The plane of symmetry makes the 'cis' hydrogen on C2 equivalent to the 'cis' hydrogen on C5. Similarly, the 'trans' hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' hydrogen on C5. Therefore, these four hydrogens give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n    4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are further from C1 and are also chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Following the same logic as for C2/C5, the four hydrogens on these two carbons also give rise to **2** distinct signals ('cis' pair and 'trans' pair).\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the different types of hydrogens:\n    *   1 (from aldehyde group)\n    *   1 (from C1)\n    *   2 (from C2 and C5)\n    *   2 (from C3 and C4)\n    *   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).\n\n<<<C>>>"
