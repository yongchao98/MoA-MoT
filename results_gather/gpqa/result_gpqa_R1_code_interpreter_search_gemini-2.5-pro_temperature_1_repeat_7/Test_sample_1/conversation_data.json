    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO.\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring (C₆H₅), 1 in the benzylic -CH= group, 1 in the subsequent =CH- group, and 1 in the aldehyde -CHO group.\n    *   Total carbons in cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 carbons.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr)**\n    *   This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** The Grignard reagent performs a 1,2-nucleophilic addition to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The C=O double bond is converted into a C-O single bond, which is then protonated (in an acidic workup step, which is implicit in such problems) to form a secondary alcohol.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO + CH₃MgBr → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O⁻MgBr⁺)CH₃\n    *   Workup with H₃O⁺ → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol, C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the methyl group) to the cinnamaldehyde skeleton.\n    *   Total carbons = 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from CH₃MgBr) = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant: Product 1**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃. This is a secondary alcohol.\n\n*   **Reagent: Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   PCC is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other functional groups like C=C double bonds.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 2:** This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n    *   Total carbons = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant: Product 2**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone).\n\n*   **Reagent: (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   This is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. It is a sulfur ylide that acts as a source for a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reaction:** When reacting with α,β-unsaturated ketones, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent performs a conjugate addition (Michael addition). The CH₂ group from the ylide adds across the C=C double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is a cyclopropyl ketone. The original α and β carbons of the enone, along with the CH₂ from the ylide, form the three-membered ring. The structure is 1-acetyl-2-phenylcyclopropane.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** This reaction adds one carbon atom (the methylene group) to the structure of Product 2.\n    *   Total carbons = 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the ylide) = 11 carbons.\n\nTo confirm the final count, let's analyze the structure of Product 3 (1-acetyl-2-phenylcyclopropane):\n*   Phenyl group (C₆H₅-): 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropane ring: 3 carbons\n*   Acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃): 2 carbons (The C of the C=O group and the C of the CH₃ group)\n*   Let's be careful not to double count. The atoms of the phenyl group and acetyl group are attached *to* the cyclopropane ring.\n    *   Phenyl group: 6 C\n    *   Cyclopropane ring carbons: 3 C\n    *   Acetyl group carbons: 2 C\n    *   One ring carbon is bonded to the phenyl group, and another ring carbon is bonded to the acetyl group.\n    *   Total = 6 (phenyl) + 3 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 11 carbons.\n\nLet's use a simple script to formalize the counting process.\n```python\n# Initial number of carbons in trans-cinnamaldehyde (C6H5-CH=CH-CHO)\ncarbons_start = 9\n\n# Step 1: Add methylmagnesium bromide (adds 1 carbon)\ncarbons_step1 = carbons_start + 1\n\n# Step 2: Oxidation with PCC (adds 0 carbons)\ncarbons_step2 = carbons_step1 + 0\n\n# Step 3: Corey-Chaykovsky reaction (adds 1 carbon)\ncarbons_step3 = carbons_step2 + 1\n\n# Final number of carbon atoms in product 3\nprint(carbons_step3)\n```\n11\n\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>",
