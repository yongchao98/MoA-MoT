    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups and Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4). A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure R-COO-R'. It contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which corresponds to 1 DBE. It also accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula.\n*   **1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals:** Vinyl protons are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C double bond corresponds to 1 DBE.\n*   **Total Expected DBE:** Summing the degrees of unsaturation from the identified functional groups: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6 DBE.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the DBE for Each of the Proposed Formulas**\n\nThe formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a molecule with formula CxHyOz is:\nDBE = x - y/2 + 1\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for each option:\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. This **matches** our expected DBE.\n*   **B) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This does not match. A DBE of 5 would mean one of the double bonds (likely the vinyl C=C) is missing, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This **matches** our expected DBE.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This does not match. A DBE of 7 implies an additional ring or double bond not accounted for by the provided spectral data.\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options B and D. We are left with options A and C.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Count from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's determine the total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule from the NMR data.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons attached to it. So, this accounts for **4H**.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H:** This means there are two distinct protons on a C=C double bond. This accounts for **2H**. (The doublet and doublet of quartets pattern strongly suggests a -CH=CH-CH3 group).\n*   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** This indicates two non-equivalent methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 protons. So, this accounts for 2 * 3H = **6H**.\n*   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of methylene groups.\n\n**Total Proton Count:** 4H (aromatic) + 2H (vinyl) + 6H (methyl) = **12H**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Proton Count with the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we compare this total proton count with the number of hydrogens in the remaining possible formulas:\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This formula has **12 hydrogens**. This **matches** our calculated proton count.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** This formula has **14 hydrogens**. This **does not match** our calculated proton count.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C11H12O2** is consistent with all the information provided:\n1.  It has the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) for an ester.\n2.  Its degree of unsaturation (DBE=6) matches the structural features (aromatic ring, ester C=O, vinyl C=C).\n3.  Its number of hydrogen atoms (12) matches the total proton count from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nA plausible structure that fits all the data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which has the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
