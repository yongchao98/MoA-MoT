    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its components that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation. The IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n    *   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another. So, this part contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl (-CHO):** This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2):** This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    Summing these up, the total IHD of the reactant is:\n    IHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD.\n    - Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 C\n    - Oxygens: 2 (acid) + 1 (formyl) = 3 O\n    - Hydrogens: The formula for a C10 acyclic alkane is C10H22. The IHD is the number of pairs of hydrogens missing compared to this.\n    Let's draw the structure and count hydrogens: C10H12O3.\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    This confirms the IHD of the starting material is 5.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI). This is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to reduce various functional groups to alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to methylene (-CH2-) or methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   The reaction is strong enough to remove all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does not break open saturated rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Product and its IHD**\n    The reaction will cause the following changes to the reactant's structure:\n    1.  The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    3.  The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    4.  The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    The ring structure itself remains intact. Therefore, the only component contributing to the IHD in the final product is the cyclohexane ring.\n\n    The change in IHD can be calculated as:\n    IHD_product = IHD_reactant - (number of π bonds reduced)\n    IHD_product = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Any saturated monocyclic alkane (like cyclohexane and its derivatives) has an IHD of 1, which accounts for the ring. Since there are no double or triple bonds left in the product, its IHD is exactly 1.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion**\n    The product obtained from the reaction has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nFinal check using the molecular formula of the product:\nThe reactant is C10H12O3. The reaction removes all 3 oxygen atoms and saturates all 4 pi bonds. The product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon is CnH2n. Therefore, the product's formula is C10H20.\nIHD_product = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
