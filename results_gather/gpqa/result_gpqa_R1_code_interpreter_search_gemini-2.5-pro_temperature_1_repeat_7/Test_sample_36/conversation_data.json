    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product E, followed by an analysis of its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and Ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH, abbreviated as EDT). BF₃ is a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a thioacetal. The carbonyl group of the aldehyde reacts with the two thiol groups of EDT to form a six-membered ring called a 1,3-dithiane. The aldehyde's alkyl group (ethyl group) becomes a substituent on the carbon atom that was formerly the carbonyl carbon (C2 of the dithiane ring).\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane) and Butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi deprotonates the most acidic C-H bond in molecule A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the electron-withdrawing sulfur atoms. This process is known as umpolung.\n*   **Product B:** 2-lithio-2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. This is a nucleophilic carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** The nucleophile B and an electrophile, bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** A nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction occurs. The carbanion of B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane. Now, the C2 carbon is bonded to two ethyl groups.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (a thioacetal) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of the thioacetal back to a carbonyl compound. The Hg²⁺ ion coordinates to the sulfur atoms, facilitating the cleavage of the C-S bonds and subsequent hydrolysis.\n*   **Product D:** The C2 carbon of the dithiane becomes a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and the two ethyl groups remain attached. The product is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone (CH₃CH₂-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to form a phosphorus ylide *in situ*, which then reacts with the ketone D.\n    1.  **Ylide Formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane (a secondary alkyl halide, (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt, [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon bonded to the phosphorus to generate the ylide: Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    2.  **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide (Ph₃P=C(Et)₂) reacts with the ketone D (O=C(Et)₂). The oxygen atom of the ketone is exchanged with the carbon group of the ylide.\n        (Et)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(Et)₂ → (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n*   **Product E:** The final product is tetraethylethylene. Its IUPAC name is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\nThe structure of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene) is:\n\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n              \\   /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond, perpendicular to the bond. This symmetry means that the left half of the molecule is identical to the right half. It also has a plane of symmetry containing the C=C bond.\n2.  **Equivalent Carbons:**\n    *   **Alkene Carbons:** The two sp² hybridized carbons of the C=C double bond are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Ethyl Group Carbons:** All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the overall symmetry of the molecule. Within each ethyl group, there is a methylene (-CH₂-) carbon and a methyl (-CH₃) carbon.\n        *   The four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are all in identical chemical environments. This will produce **one signal**.\n        *   The four methyl (-CH₃-) carbons are also all in identical chemical environments. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn total, there are three sets of chemically equivalent carbons in product E. Therefore, its 13C-NMR spectrum will show **3 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
