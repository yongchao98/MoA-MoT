    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aryl halide with a deuterium label at an ortho position.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as the base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium (D) atom.\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\nThe amide base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is broken more easily and faster than the C-D bond. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n    5.  This creates an unsymmetrical benzyne intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n    3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed in this step.\n    5.  This creates a symmetrical benzyne intermediate: **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n**3. Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition Step)**\n\nThe second step is the nucleophilic attack of another amide ion (NH2⁻) on the benzyne intermediates, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne)**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C2, no D).\n    *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 leads to a carbanion at C2, which is protonated by NH3.\n    *   Attack at C2 leads to a carbanion at C1, which is protonated by NH3.\n    *   Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n    *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n*   **Attack on Intermediate from Pathway A (3-Deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical (triple bond between C1 and C6, with a D at C2).\n    *   The NH2⁻ can attack either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to different products.\n    *   **Attack at C1:**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ group attaches to C1.\n        2.  A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH3.\n        3.  The final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        4.  **Product 2: 2-deuteroaniline**\n    *   **Attack at C6:**\n        1.  The NH2⁻ group attaches to C6.\n        2.  A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated by NH3.\n        3.  The final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2.\n        4.  To name this molecule, we number the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH2 group as C1. In this case, the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        5.  **Product 3: 3-deuteroaniline**\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
