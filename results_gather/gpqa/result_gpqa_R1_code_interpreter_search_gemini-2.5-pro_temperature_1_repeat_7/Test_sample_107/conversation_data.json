    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify and Formulate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:\n$H_{Z} = -\\vec{\\mu}_{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}_{L}$ is the orbital magnetic moment operator.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum operator $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_{L} = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H_{Z} = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$H_{Z} = \\frac{e}{2m_e} L_z B$\n\nThe expectation value of this energy, which we will denote as $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is given by the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a physical constant known as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\nSo, the energy of the paramagnetic coupling is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Value of the Paramagnetic Coupling Term\n\nWe are given:\n*   A small value for the orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$. We can use $m=1$ for the order-of-magnitude calculation.\n*   A magnetic field strength $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$.\n\nWe need the value of the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$. In convenient units, $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is $10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n### 3. Identify and Formulate the Transition Energy\n\nThe transition energy, $\\Delta E$, corresponds to a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The formula relating energy and wavelength is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the transition.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Value of the Transition Energy\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nA useful value for the product $hc$ is approximately $1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\nFirst, we convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nNow, we calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the transition energy is $1 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition in Hydrogen, from n=4 to n=2).\n\n### 5. Compare the Two Energies\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small, it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is much smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nWe can also compare their orders of magnitude directly:\n$10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} \\ll 1 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nThis confirms our conclusion.\n\nTo be certain, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\n# Bohr magneton in eV/T\nmu_B_eV_T = 5.7883818012e-5\n# Product of Planck's constant and speed of light in eV*nm\nhc_eV_nm = 1240\n\n# Given values\n# Small integer for orbital magnetic quantum number\nm = 1\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1\n# Wavelength in micrometers\nlambda_um = 0.4861\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Paramagnetic coupling energy (Zeeman energy)\nH_coupling = m * mu_B_eV_T * B\n\n# 2. Transition energy\n# Convert wavelength from micrometers to nanometers\nlambda_nm = lambda_um * 1000\nDelta_E = hc_eV_nm / lambda_nm\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_coupling:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E:.3f} eV\")\nprint(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is {H_coupling / Delta_E:.3e}\")\nprint(\"Comparing the two values, <H> is several orders of magnitude smaller than Delta E.\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 5.788e-05 eV\nTransition energy Delta E = 2.551 eV\nThe ratio <H> / Delta E is 2.269e-05\nComparing the two values, <H> is several orders of magnitude smaller than Delta E.\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the paramagnetic coupling energy ($\\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV) is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy ($\\approx 2.55$ eV). Therefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  **The paramagnetic coupling energy**, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, which arises from the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).\n2.  **The transition energy**, $\\Delta E$, of a specific atomic transition in the Hydrogen atom, characterized by the wavelength of the emitted/absorbed photon.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling (linear Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum operator and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The energy expectation value is then:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle B$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So, the energy levels are shifted by:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton, denoted by $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T} = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\nThe energy is therefore:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is a small integer. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can take the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   The product $hc$ is conveniently expressed as $1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\n\nWe are given the wavelength:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n(This wavelength corresponds to the blue-green line in the Hydrogen Balmer series, the transition from n=4 to n=2).\n\nNow, we calculate the energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Two Energies\n\nNow we compare the two calculated values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's look at the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. This is a general result: for typical magnetic fields, the Zeeman splitting is much smaller than the energy difference between principal electronic levels.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
