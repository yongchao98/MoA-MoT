    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: `(2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5`. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, leaving one more, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), as per the n+1 rule (n=2 protons on the adjacent carbon).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment (an ethanal group). The coupling between the aldehyde proton (t) and the methylene protons (d) is consistent.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7 ppm), suggesting the ring is substituted with electron-donating groups.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine group (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a `-NH₂` group and a `-CH₂-CHO` group.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + NH₂ + C₂H₃O (ethanal group) = C₈H₉NO. The formula matches.\n    The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/gKq9b9g.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C). The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    The intermediate formed is **2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    Adding water (and usually warming) to an aromatic diazonium salt results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group, departing as nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**, also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n     ![Intermediate 2: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/gJ63t9R.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**. The aldehyde, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl).\n\n    *   **Part A: Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This results in an aldol addition product.\n        The addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (A).\n\n    *   **Part B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" is a crucial piece of information. The aldol addition product is often unstable under heat and will readily dehydrate (lose a molecule of water) to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The dehydration is particularly favorable here because the resulting C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the phenyl rings.\n        The removal of the α-proton (from C-2) and the hydroxyl group (from C-3) leads to the formation of a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n\n         \n\n    The final product is the dehydrated condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, stable aldol condensation product formed after dehydration. This structure matches our derived product.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This has an incorrect molecular formula and structure.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is missing the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
