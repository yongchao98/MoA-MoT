    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that the more precisely you know the lifetime of a particle (or state), the less precisely you can know its energy, and vice versa.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Relationship:** The mathematical expression for the energy-time uncertainty principle is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n    For an unstable state with a mean lifetime τ, the uncertainty in time Δt is on the order of τ. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the state. The relationship is commonly approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ seconds.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ seconds.\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the \"blurriness\" caused by their energy uncertainties. A standard criterion for two peaks to be resolved is that their separation must be at least on the order of the sum of their individual widths (or more formally, the sum of their half-widths at half-maximum, which is what ΔE represents).\n\n    Therefore, the condition for the energy levels to be resolvable is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE₁ is the energy width of the first state.\n    *   ΔE₂ is the energy width of the second state.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Widths (ΔE):**\n    First, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), as the answer options are in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J\n    *   ħ ≈ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    Now, calculate the individual energy widths:\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Difference:**\n    The minimum energy difference for resolution is the sum of the individual energy widths.\n    Minimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    Minimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    Minimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    Minimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The required energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) - Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) - Clearly resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV   (<< 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) - Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV) - Not resolvable.\n\n    Only option B provides an energy difference that is significantly larger than the minimum required separation calculated from the uncertainty principle.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than their combined energy widths. The calculated minimum separation is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV. Option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, is the only choice that satisfies this condition.\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, a quick Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (delta_E * tau ~ hbar)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the difference in their energies\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (delta_E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (delta_E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution (delta_E1 + delta_E2): {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-11, 'B': 1e-4, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-9}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough for resolution.\")\n\n```\nThe Python code confirms that the minimum required energy difference is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV and that only option B (10⁻⁴ eV) is a sufficiently large energy difference.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n2.  **Energy Width of a State:** For an unstable quantum state with a lifetime τ, the lifetime represents the time interval over which the state exists. This lifetime can be taken as the uncertainty in time, Δt ≈ τ. Consequently, the energy of the state is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE), often called the natural linewidth. The relationship is approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** To clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their combined energy widths. A standard criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n    Condition for resolution: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Next, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n        *   State 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n          ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   State 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n          ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   Now, we find the minimum required energy difference for resolution by summing the widths:\n        Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n        Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** We need to find an option that is greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV (much smaller)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (much larger)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (much smaller)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV (much smaller)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states, as it is significantly greater than the sum of their natural linewidths. The code output confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
