    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon within that nucleus. Let's analyze each statement to see how it contributes to this picture.\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is the first and most fundamental assumption. It posits that the probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino, or photon) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. This excludes more complex scenarios, such as \"meson-exchange currents,\" where the probe interacts with the virtual particles (mesons) being exchanged between nucleons. By limiting the interaction to a single nucleon, we are taking the first step toward treating it as an isolated, free particle. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It states that the incoming probe does not interact with other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not re-interact with the remaining \"spectator\" nucleons on their way out. These potential re-interactions are called \"final-state interactions\" (or initial-state interactions). Ignoring them is crucial for the final measured state to accurately reflect the initial, simple one-nucleon interaction. This effectively assumes the rest of the nucleus is a non-interacting medium, which is key to the \"free nucleon\" picture. This assumption is also essential.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself (protons and neutrons are composed of quarks and gluons). While the dynamics of quarks are fundamental to understanding the nucleon's properties, the impulse approximation itself is about the nucleon's behavior *as a composite particle within the nuclear medium*. The approximation can be applied in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks for the *nucleon's* motion. The relativistic nature of the quarks *inside* the nucleon is a separate physical consideration and is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. Therefore, this statement is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The approximation is valid when the interaction involves a large transfer of energy and momentum over a very short timescale. The idea is that the interaction is so sudden and violent that the nucleon is struck and ejected before it has time to \"feel\" the relatively weak and slow-acting binding forces from the surrounding nucleons. In this \"frozen\" snapshot, the nucleon behaves as if it were free from the nuclear potential. This assumption is essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe three assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The rest of the nucleus is a passive spectator, with no initial or final state interactions (Statement 2).\n*   During the brief moment of interaction, the nucleon's binding to the nucleus can be ignored (Statement 4).\n\nThese three assumptions (1, 2, and 4) work together to allow us to treat a complex many-body problem as a much simpler interaction with a single, free nucleon.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
