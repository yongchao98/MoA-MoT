    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to determine the compound's structure.**\n    1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n    2.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    3.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to one of the carbons of the benzene ring. Let's denote this substituent as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural clues to identify the molecule.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits the description \"-C2 and C=O\" is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the possible isomers and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers are asymmetrical. They would have four unique protons on the aromatic ring, each giving a separate signal (integrating to 1H each) with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublet of doublets, triplets).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer is symmetrical. Due to the plane of symmetry, there are only two types of protons on the aromatic ring.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are chemically equivalent.\n        *   This results in a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H).\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) contains three equivalent methyl protons. Since there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon, this signal will be a singlet, integrating to 3 protons (3H).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given 1H NMR data options against the expected spectrum for the para-isomer.**\n    *   The expected spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone is:\n        *   Aromatic region (~7.0-8.5 ppm): A doublet for 2H and another doublet for 2H.\n        *   Aliphatic region (~2.0-3.0 ppm): A singlet for 3H.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. This would imply a different molecule, one which violates the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" condition (e.g., 4-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde). So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the typical range for aromatic protons. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate, with the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group appearing further downfield (7.8 ppm).\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a singlet for 3 protons, with a chemical shift typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n        *   This data set is a perfect match for a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to B, the chemical shifts are not correct for this type of aromatic compound. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: The only NMR data that correctly describes a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond is C, which corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
