    "This is a molecular biology problem that requires analyzing a DNA sequence to identify a potential issue with protein expression.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to express a fusion protein in mammalian cells (CHO cells). The protein consists of an N-terminal HA tag followed by the mouse GADD45G protein. The experiment is failing because the protein is not being expressed as expected.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence:** The sequence is the coding strand (plus strand) of the DNA construct. This means its sequence is equivalent to the resulting mRNA, with Thymine (T) in place of Uracil (U). The ribosome will translate this sequence codon by codon (in groups of three nucleotides).\n\n    *   **Sequence:**\n        `5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGG...TGA3'`\n\n3.  **Translate the Beginning of the Sequence:** We need to read the sequence in the correct reading frame, starting from the initiation codon, which is typically `ATG`.\n\n    *   **Codon 1:** `ATG` -> This codes for Methionine (M), the start codon. Translation will begin here.\n    *   **Codons 2-10 (HA Tag):** The user specified an N-terminal HA tag (`YPYDVPDYA`). Let's see if the sequence codes for this.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n        The translated sequence so far is M-YPYDVPDYA. This matches the intended HA tag preceded by a start methionine. The tag sequence itself is correct.\n\n    *   **Continue Translating After the Tag:** Now, let's look at the very next codons which should be the start of the GADD45G coding sequence.\n        *   The sequence continues: `...GCC` **`AAA` `TGA`** `...`\n        *   **Codon 11:** `AAA` -> This codes for Lysine (K).\n        *   **Codon 12:** `TGA` -> This is a **stop codon**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Problem:** A `TGA` stop codon is present immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional amino acid. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it will not add an amino acid. Instead, a release factor will bind, and translation will be terminated. The ribosome will detach from the mRNA, and the very short, incomplete polypeptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) will be released. The full-length GADD45G protein will never be synthesized.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** The stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. This statement is irrelevant and incorrect in this context.\n    *   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins. The primary issue here is not that the protein is being degraded after being made, but that it's not being made in the first place (a failure in synthesis). This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As shown in step 3, the DNA sequence for the HA tag correctly translates to the YPYDVPDYA peptide. There is no mutation within the tag sequence itself. The error occurs after it. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what happened. The presence of a premature `TGA` stop codon caused the ribosome to halt synthesis long before the end of the GADD45G coding sequence was reached. This directly explains the failure to express the full-length protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
