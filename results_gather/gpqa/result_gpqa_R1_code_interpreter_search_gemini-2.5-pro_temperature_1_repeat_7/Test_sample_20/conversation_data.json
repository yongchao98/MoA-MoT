    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert by the migration of a proton, typically accompanied by a shift of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**: The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are the carbons involved in the C=C double bonds. These carbons have no hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, possessing two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows this compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol isomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic and highly stable, so the equilibrium strongly favors it.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A**: The compound that **does not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. Therefore, A = benzoquinone.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        *   -H (hydrogen)\n        *   -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer. The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of symmetry (midpoint of the C=C bond) and a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the entire molecule). Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B**: The compound that **will show** optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Therefore, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n*   **Final Answer**:\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
