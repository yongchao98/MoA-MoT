    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n    *   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin vector operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the magnetic moment is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E = -γB * (±ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is the one with the spin pointing in the same direction as the field, which is the `|+z>` state. So, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the Z direction is turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution:**\n    *   The state of the system will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   We need to find the expectation value (the average) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    A powerful way to solve this is using the Heisenberg picture, which is equivalent to using Ehrenfest's theorem. The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by:\n    `d<A>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, A]>` (for an operator `A` with no explicit time dependence).\n\n    Let's apply this to our observables, `<S_x>`, `<S_y>`, and `<S_z>`. The Hamiltonian is `H = -γBS_y`.\n\n    *   For `<S_z>`:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[-γBS_y, S_z]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[S_y, S_z]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`:\n        `d<S_z>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (iħ<S_x>) = γB <S_x>`\n\n    *   For `<S_x>`:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[-γBS_y, S_x]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[S_y, S_x]>`\n        Using the spin commutation relation `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`, which means `[S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z`:\n        `d<S_x>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (-iħ<S_z>) = -γB <S_z>`\n\n5.  **Solve the Differential Equations:**\n    We have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations:\n    1) `d<S_z>/dt = γB * <S_x>`\n    2) `d<S_x>/dt = -γB * <S_z>`\n\n    Let's differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * d<S_x>/dt`\n\n    Now, substitute the second equation into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = γB * (-γB * <S_z>) = -(γB)² * <S_z>`\n\n    This is the classic equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`. The general solution is `x(t) = A*cos(ωt + φ)`.\n    By comparing the equations, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The expectation value of `S_z`, and therefore the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment `<μ_z> = γ<S_z>`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `ω` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, and the options provided have the units of angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
