    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. For distances far from the source (the radiation zone), a localized oscillating charge distribution, like the spheroid described, can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole. The axis of oscillation is given as the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The formula is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `f(λ, θ)` is the function mentioned in the problem.\n\n2.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The maximum power is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, the maximum power per unit solid angle is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\n3.  **Power Radiated at θ = 30°:**\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We use the same proportionality:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    `Fraction = [(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°)] / [(dP/dΩ)_max] = [k * sin²(30°)] / [k * sin²(90°)]` (where k is the constant of proportionality)\n    `Fraction = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\n5.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula, which shows that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n    `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n    The power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` will also have this frequency dependence.\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω`, speed of light `c`, and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πf_freq = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality for `f`:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n    So, a possible form for the wavelength dependence of `f` is `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse fourth-power dependence is also characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength, a conceptually similar phenomenon.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nCombining these two results, we look at the given options:\nA) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴`\nB) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴`\nC) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶`\nD) 1/4, `λ⁻³`\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the angle in degrees\ntheta_degrees = 30\n\n# Convert the angle to radians for the sin function\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# We want to find the fraction of the maximum power at theta = 30 degrees.\n# This fraction is (sin^2(30)) / (sin^2(90)) = sin^2(30) / 1.\nfraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\n# The radiated power from an oscillating dipole (Larmor formula) is proportional to the\n# fourth power of the angular frequency (ω^4).\n# Since ω = 2*pi*c/λ, the power is proportional to (1/λ)^4, or λ^(-4).\n# This is a fundamental result from classical electrodynamics.\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of the maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\nprint(\"The wavelength dependence is of the form: λ^(-4)\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution, especially one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole for radiation in the far-field (radiation zone). The axis of the dipole corresponds to the symmetry axis of the spheroid, which is the z-axis.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is not isotropic. It depends on the angle `θ` measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The classical formula for this is:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    This function `f` mentioned in the problem, `f(λ, θ)`, must therefore be proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Radiated Power (A):**\n    The maximum power is radiated in the direction where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` or `π/2` radians (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, the maximum power per unit solid angle, `A`, is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1² = 1`.\n    `A ∝ 1`\n\n3.  **Power Radiated at θ = 30°:**\n    To find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`, we evaluate the `sin²(θ)` term at this angle.\n    `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    The power radiated at 30° is `(dP/dΩ)_(30°) ∝ 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n    Fraction = `[(dP/dΩ)_(30°)] / A = (k * 1/4) / (k * 1) = 1/4`\n    (where `k` is the constant of proportionality).\n    The code output confirms this calculation: `0.24999...` is the floating-point representation of `1/4`.\n\n5.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power (f(λ, θ)):**\n    According to the Larmor formula, the total power `P` radiated by an accelerating charge (and thus an oscillating dipole) is proportional to the square of the acceleration, which in turn is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n    `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n    The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, will have the same dependence on frequency.\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `ν` is the frequency.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality for power:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also seen in Rayleigh scattering, which involves the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\nA possible functional form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴`\nB) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴`\nC) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶`\nD) 1/4, `λ⁻³`\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
