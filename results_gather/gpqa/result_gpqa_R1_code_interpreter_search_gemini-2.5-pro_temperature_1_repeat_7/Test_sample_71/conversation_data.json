    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction to form product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant A:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative, which acts as a dienophile. It has two double bonds available for cycloaddition reactions.\n*   **Reactant B:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This chemical name is unusual and likely a typo for a common precursor used in synthesis. A very common and chemically sound precursor for the reaction described is **1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene**.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** When 1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene is treated with NaI, it undergoes reductive debromination to form a highly reactive intermediate called **o-xylylene** (or o-quinodimethane). This species is an excellent diene for Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   The problem states that 2 equivalents of reactant B are used. Since reactant A has two double bonds, this strongly suggests a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. One molecule of A reacts with two molecules of the in-situ generated o-xylylene.\n*   The o-xylylene diene will add across each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene. Diels-Alder reactions on norbornene systems typically proceed with *exo* stereoselectivity.\n*   **Product 1:** The result is a large, symmetric molecule with a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core fused to two identical polycyclic systems. Each of these systems contains a cyclohexadiene ring, which is a remnant of the o-xylylene structure.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, H₂O).\n*   **Reactions:**\n    1.  **Ether Cleavage:** Strong acid cleaves the tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) is converted to a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing isobutene.\n    2.  **Aromatization:** The two cyclohexadiene rings, formed in the Diels-Alder step, are in a structural environment that strongly favors aromatization to stable benzene rings. Acid catalysis facilitates this transformation.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting structure is a dibenzo-fused bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton with a hydroxyl group at the C7 bridge. The systematic name for this core structure is 9,10-dihydro-9,10-methanoanthracene. Product 2 is **9,10-dihydro-9,10-methanoanthracen-11-ol** (using the standard numbering for this system, where the bridge carbon is C11). Its chemical formula is C₁₅H₁₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (a secondary alcohol).\n*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents corresponds to the **Parikh-Doering oxidation**, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.\n*   **Product 3:** The secondary alcohol at the bridge position (C11) is oxidized to a ketone. Product 3 is **9,10-dihydro-9,10-methanoanthracen-11-one**. Its chemical formula is C₁₅H₁₀O.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (a ketone).\n*   **Conditions:** Heated at 150 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** Bridged ketones like product 3 are known to undergo thermal **decarbonylation**, which is a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO). The bridge containing the C=O group is extruded, and a new bond forms between the bridgehead carbons (C9 and C10).\n*   `C₁₅H₁₀O (ketone) → C₁₄H₁₀ + CO`\n*   **Product 4:** The product of this reaction is **anthracene** (C₁₄H₁₀).\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting the Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen atoms in the final product, 4.\n\n*   **Product 4 is Anthracene (C₁₄H₁₀).**\n*   Anthracene is a highly symmetric molecule (D₂h point group). Due to this symmetry, many of its hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent.\n*   The 10 hydrogens in anthracene fall into three distinct sets:\n    1.  The four hydrogens at the \"alpha\" positions (1, 4, 5, 8).\n    2.  The four hydrogens at the \"beta\" positions (2, 3, 6, 7).\n    3.  The two hydrogens at the \"meso\" positions (9, 10).\n*   Therefore, anthracene has **3** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms, which would correspond to 3 signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nHowever, the number 3 is not among the given options (A) 7, (B) 10, (C) 8, (D) 4. This indicates a likely flaw in the question's wording. A common issue in such problems is that \"chemically distinct hydrogen atoms\" is used incorrectly when the intended question is about the *total number of hydrogen atoms*.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\n*   How many **total** hydrogen atoms are in product 4 (anthracene, C₁₄H₁₀)? The formula shows there are **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   This number, 10, matches option B.\n\nTo be certain, let's check the total number of hydrogens in product 3 (the ketone, C₁₅H₁₀O). It also has **10** hydrogen atoms. Since the final step (decarbonylation) does not change the number of hydrogen atoms in the organic molecule, the answer is robustly 10.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the chemically correct number of distinct hydrogens (3) and the available options, the most logical conclusion is that the question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
