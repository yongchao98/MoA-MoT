    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the directing effects of substituents.**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a substituted benzene ring. The existing substituent on the ring determines the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the new bromine atom will attach. This is known as the directing effect.\n\n*   **Activating groups** and **weakly deactivating halogens** are **ortho-, para-directors**. They direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves.\n*   **Moderately and strongly deactivating groups** are **meta-directors**. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents for each substance.**\n\nLet's analyze the substituent for each of the six substances:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 (methyl) is an activating group, so it's an **ortho-, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating group, so it's a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl (chloro) is a weakly deactivating group, but it's an **ortho-, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating group, so it's a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating group, so it's an **ortho-, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating group, so it's a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the substances into two groups.**\n\nBased on their directing effects, we can form two groups. The meta-directors will produce a very small amount of the para-isomer, while the ortho-, para-directors will produce a significant amount. Therefore, the substances in the meta-directing group will come first in the order of increasing para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Group 1 (Low para-yield)**: These are the meta-directors.\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n*   **Group 2 (High para-yield)**: These are the ortho-, para-directors.\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within Group 1 (meta-directors).**\n\nThe question asks for the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield. For meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\nThe beginning of our final sequence should be **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Order the substances within Group 2 (ortho-, para-directors).**\n\nFor ortho-, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is primarily influenced by two factors: electronics and sterics.\n\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):**\n    *   The substituents are -CH3 and -C2H5. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile (bromine) to the ortho positions more significantly in ethylbenzene than in toluene.\n    *   Consequently, ethylbenzene will form a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   So, the order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Comparing Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) with Chlorobenzene (3):**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is an ortho-, para-director due to resonance donation, but it's deactivating overall due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal.\n    *   This strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho position more than the para position (due to proximity). This leads to a strong preference for substitution at the para position.\n    *   Generally, halogens like chlorine give a very high percentage of para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. This percentage is typically higher than that for simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene will be the highest among these three.\n    *   So, we have: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n*   **Combining the order for Group 2:**\n    *   Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n    *   The sequence for this group is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the orders of both groups.**\n\nWe place the ordered Group 1 before the ordered Group 2.\n\n*   Group 1 order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Group 2 order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
