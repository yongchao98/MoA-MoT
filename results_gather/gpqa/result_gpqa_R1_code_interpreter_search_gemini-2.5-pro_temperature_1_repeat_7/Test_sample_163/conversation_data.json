    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2), i.e., M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible), the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K1_total) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n        *   Total velocity amplitude (K2_total) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n4.  **Use the Information about Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. An eclipse can only occur if the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. Since this applies to both systems, the `sin³(i)` term can be considered equal for both and will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M1 / M2.\n    M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_total)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\n    Since the constants (2 * π * G) and the inclination terms (sin³(i)) cancel out, the ratio simplifies to:\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (P2 * (K2_total)³)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute the values for each system into the simplified formula. It's important to use consistent units for Period (years) and Velocity (km/s), as they will be part of a ratio and the specific conversion factors will cancel out.\n    *   M1 / M2 = (2 years * (15 km/s)³) / (1 year * (25 km/s)³)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (15³ / 25³)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:** To find the decimal value, a calculation is performed.\n```python\n# Values for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_sum = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Values for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_sum = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio M1/M2\n# M1/M2 = (P1 * (K1_sum)**3) / (P2 * (K2_sum)**3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_sum)**3) / (P2 * (K2_sum)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is 0.432.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~0.432 is closest to the given option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by the formula:\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nwhere:\n*   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars (m1 + m2).\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nFor system_1:\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K1_total) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\nFor system_2:\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K2_total) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information because eclipses only occur when the inclination angle `i` is close to 90 degrees. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. We can assume this is the case for both systems.\n\nNow we can set up the ratio M1 / M2:\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2_total)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\nSince 2, π, G, and sin³(i) are constants or approximately equal for both systems, they cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\nM1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1_total)³) / (P2 * (K2_total)³)\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\nM1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
