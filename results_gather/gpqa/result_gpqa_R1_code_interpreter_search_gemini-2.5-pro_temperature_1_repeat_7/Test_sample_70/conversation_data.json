    "The user wants to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature a planet would be if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n\n**2. Simplify the relationships for a ratio:**\n*   For two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) in the same system, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for all planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is only dependent on the semi-major axis `a`.\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)`\n    So, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    `T4 / T2 = (a4 / a2)^(-1/2) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)`\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, we can establish a relationship between the ratio of semi-major axes and the ratio of orbital periods:\n    `(P4 / P2)² = (a4 / a2)³`\n    `a4 / a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3)`\n\n**3. Combine the equations:**\n*   Substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio (`a4 / a2`) into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T4 / T2 = [(P4 / P2)^(2/3)]^(-1/2)`\n*   Simplify the exponents:\n    `T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n    `T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`\n\n**4. Use the given data to calculate the final ratio:**\n*   The orbital period ratios are given as `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n*   From this, the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\n    `P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75`\n*   Now, calculate the temperature ratio:\n    `T4 / T2 = (1.75)^(-1/3)`\n\nI will use Python to compute the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3)\n# P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nperiod_ratio = 1.75\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(-1/3)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```",
    "The calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.8298.\n\nLet's compare this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 matches option C.\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1.  **Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** `T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)` since albedo, star temperature, and star radius are constant for both planets.\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, which means `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n3.  **Combine Formulas:** Substitute `a` into the temperature formula: `T_eq ∝ (1 / P^(2/3))^(1/2) = P^(-1/3)`.\n4.  **Ratio Calculation:** `T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`.\n5.  **Insert Values:** The period ratio `P4 / P2` is given as `3.5 / 2 = 1.75`.\n6.  **Compute:** `T4 / T2 = (1.75)^(-1/3) ≈ 0.8298`.\n7.  **Match with Options:** The result is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThe reasoning and calculation are sound.
