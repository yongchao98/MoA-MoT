    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction is given as a percentage, so 14.28% = 0.1428. This value is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons using simple integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass fraction of H = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 7(2n + 2) = 14n + 2, which simplifies to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, or 14 = 2, which is impossible.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n*   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent and fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This is consistent with cycloalkanes like cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), or methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's call the components of Y, Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n (a cycloalkane).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenating Y2 must also produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests it's saturated. However, a saturated compound typically does not react with hydrogen, unless it's a strained ring that undergoes hydrogenolysis (ring-opening). But if Y2 were a structural isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane vs. cyclohexane), hydrogenation would not convert one to the other; it would produce a different alkane.\n*   The exception for \"does not decolorize bromine water\" is an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds like benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8) do not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to their corresponding cycloalkanes under severe conditions.\n*   This leads to the hypothesis that Y2 is the aromatic analogue of Z.\n    *   Y = {CnH2n (cycloalkane Z), CnH2n-6 (aromatic compound)}.\n*   Let's check this hypothesis: Hydrogenation of CnH2n gives CnH2n. Hydrogenation of CnH2n-6 gives CnH2n. This is consistent with the fact that hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Composition of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Heating mixture X with platinum produces the equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2.\n*   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer (described as a \"disproportionation\"). One component of X is reduced to the cycloalkane (Y1=Z), and the other is oxidized to the aromatic compound (Y2).\n    X1 + X2 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n*   Since all compounds (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) must lead to Z upon hydrogenation, they must all share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n    Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n    H(X1) + H(X2) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n*   What could X1 and X2 be? They are unsaturated versions of Z. The most likely candidates are a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and a cyclodiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let X1 = CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene).\n    *   Let X2 = CnH2n-4 (cyclodiene).\n*   The reaction becomes:\n    CnH2n-2 (X1, reduced) + 2[H] → CnH2n (Y1)\n    CnH2n-4 (X2, oxidized) → CnH2n-6 (Y2) + 2[H]\n    Overall: CnH2n-2 + CnH2n-4 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6.\n*   The hydrogen count for the proposed reactants is (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6. This matches the product hydrogen count. The model is consistent.\n*   The problem states X has no conjugated bonds, so the cyclodiene (X2) must be a non-conjugated isomer (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between Possible Scenarios and Find the Answer**\n\n*   We have a general formula for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: **Total H = 4n - 6**.\n*   We need to find the value of 'n'. Common cycloalkane solvents suggest n=5, 6, or 7.\n    *   If n=5 (cyclopentane), the aromatic product C5H(10-6)=C5H4 does not correspond to a stable, common liquid. This case is unlikely.\n    *   If n=6 (cyclohexane), Z=C6H12. The aromatic is benzene (C6H6). X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Total H = 4*6 - 6 = 18.\n    *   If n=7 (methylcyclohexane), Z=C7H14. The aromatic is toluene (C7H8). X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). Total H = 4*7 - 6 = 22.\n\n*   Both scenarios (n=6 and n=7) are chemically plausible and lead to answers present in the options (A=22, D=18). We must find a way to distinguish them.\n*   The problem is likely constructed around the most fundamental and common textbook example of such a chemical transformation. The system involving cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, and benzene (the C6 system) is the archetypal example of catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions. The C7 system is a valid homologue, but less fundamental. In the absence of further distinguishing information, it is most probable that the question refers to the C6 system.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   Assuming the intended scenario is n=6:\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
