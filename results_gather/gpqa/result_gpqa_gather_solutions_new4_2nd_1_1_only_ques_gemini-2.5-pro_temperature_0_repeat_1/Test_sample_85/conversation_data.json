This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material corresponds to C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). This creates a hydroxy-acid or hydroxy-ester intermediate, which then cyclizes.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThis is the first critical point. The two reactions use different reducing agents with opposite selectivities.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a well-known reagent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by `LiBH₄`.\n    *   **Pathway:** The ester group is reduced, forming a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product.\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (`BH₃`) is a highly selective reagent that rapidly reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while reacting much more slowly with esters.\n    *   **Pathway:** The carboxylic acid group is reduced, forming a 5-hydroxyester intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification to form the product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Careful Point)**\n\nThis is the most subtle part of the problem and where most errors are made. The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the 3D spatial arrangement of the atoms is retained. However, the R/S descriptor can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center changes.\n\nLet's determine the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid side)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\n\nThe ester side (Priority 1) outranks the acid side (Priority 2).\n\n**Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n*   The ester group (original Priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n*   The acid group (original Priority 2) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n*   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n*   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. Swapping the priority of two groups at a chiral center **inverts the R/S descriptor**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n*   The acid group (original Priority 2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n*   The ester group (original Priority 1) remains `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n*   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n*   **Result:** The priority order of the groups is maintained. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention of the R/S descriptor**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for the two reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--CH2--C(3)H--CH2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone. This lactone is formed by the cyclization of `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reduction creates the intermediate `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The acidic workup (`H⁺`) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3), but we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to it change, as this can invert the R/S designation.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The two main groups attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side) and `-CH₂COOH` (acid side). The ester side has a higher CIP priority than the acid side.\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The ester side is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher CIP priority than the alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center inverts its R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a highly selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reduction creates the intermediate `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. The acidic workup (`H⁺`) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The acid side is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher CIP priority than the newly formed alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with retention of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A, the starting material must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction B, the starting material must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), followed by an intramolecular cyclization (either esterification or transesterification).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Critical Point)**\n\nThe reactions do not occur directly at the chiral center (C3). However, the chemical modification of the side chains attached to the chiral center can change their priority according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules, which can invert the R/S designation even if the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained.\n\nLet's determine the CIP priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n4.  `-H` (hydrogen)\n\nThe ester group has a higher priority than the acid group. So, the priority order is: **(1) > (2) > (3) > (4)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (original priority 1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original priority 2) remains.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** Let's re-evaluate the priorities in the hydroxy-acid intermediate. The groups are now `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   New Priority Order: `-CH₂COOH` (new 1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3).\n    *   The original priority 1 group became the new priority 2 group, and the original priority 2 group became the new priority 1 group. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.\n    *   **Swapping the priorities of two groups inverts the R/S designation.**\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   (S)-A → [inversion of descriptor] → (R)-Product\n\n### **Step 5: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the acid group (original priority 2) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original priority 1) remains.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** Let's re-evaluate the priorities in the hydroxy-ester intermediate. The groups are now `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   New Priority Order: `-CH₂COOiBu` (new 1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3).\n    *   The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center has not changed.\n    *   **The R/S designation is retained.**\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   (S)-B → [retention of descriptor] → (S)-Product\n\n### **Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of chemoselectivity and the change in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).

This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is understanding which functional group each reducing agent will attack.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to the lactone upon acidic workup.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point):** We must determine if the R/S designation of the chiral center changes. This depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) before and after the reaction.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to C3 are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The CIP priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (1)** > **-CH₂COOH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **In the Hydroxy-Acid Intermediate:** The -CH₂COOiBu group is converted to -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: **-CH₂COOH (1)** > **-CH₂CH₂OH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. When the priorities of two groups at a chiral center are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Path: (S)-A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol.

Analyze the Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents:\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). The 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups. If the reaction changes the chemical nature of a group, its priority can change, which may in turn change the R/S label even if the 3D structure is retained.\n\n*   **Groups attached to the chiral center (C3):**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **CIP Priority Order:** The ester group outranks the acid group, which outranks the ethyl group. So, the priority is: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group (original priority #1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original priority #2) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The original priority #1 group has become the new priority #2 group, and the original priority #2 group has become the new priority #1 group.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Because the priorities of the top two groups have swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (original priority #2) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original priority #1) is unchanged.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority order of the groups does not change. Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained**. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Understanding the Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key features:\n    1.  Two different carbonyl functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`) and an **isobutyl ester** (`-COOiBu`).\n    2.  A single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone.\n*   **Formation:** The lactone is formed by creating a bond between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group and the carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid (or ester) in the same molecule. This means the starting material must be converted into a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (or a derivative) which then cyclizes.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reagent Selectivity (Careful Point #1)**\n\nThis is the most critical aspect of the problem. The two reducing agents have different preferences.\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Tracing the Reaction Pathways**\n\n*   **Reaction A (A + LiBH₄):**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone. This pathway is chemically sound.\n\n*   **Reaction B (B + BH₃):**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification (the new alcohol attacks the ester) to form the same lactone. This pathway is also chemically sound.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Stereochemistry (Careful Point #2)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the attached groups, which can change when the functional groups are modified.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The ester side (priority #1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid side (priority #2) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. Swapping two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n    *   The acid side (priority #2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester side (priority #1) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group.\n    *   The priority order of the groups is maintained. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Functional Groups and Chiral Center:**\n    The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which bears the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity:**\n    *   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a well-known reagent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n    *   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemical Consequences (The Critical Point):**\n    The reactions occur at the functional groups, which are not directly attached to the chiral center. Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority ranking of the attached groups changes.\n\n    *   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid side chain (`-CH₂COOH`).\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃`\n\n4.  **Deduce Starting Material A:**\n    *   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ → (R)-product\n    *   **Transformation:** The ester group (Priority 1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n    *   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original Priority 1 group becomes a lower priority group, and the original Priority 2 group becomes the new Priority 1 group. This swap in the priority of the top two groups **inverts the R/S designation**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n5.  **Deduce Starting Material B:**\n    *   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ → (S)-product\n    *   **Transformation:** The acid group (Priority 2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n    *   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority ranking of the groups does not change. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of the R/S designation**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B. Most of the provided answers miss the subtle but crucial change in CIP priorities for Reaction A, leading them to an incorrect conclusion. The most rigorous analysis, which accounts for this change, correctly identifies both starting materials as the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid). It possesses two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at the C3 position, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). This creates a hydroxy-acid or a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes (via intramolecular esterification or transesterification) to form the lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by `LiBH₄`.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate: `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy-acid to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a highly selective reagent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while reducing esters much more slowly.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate: `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Crucial Point)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the spatial arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if the priorities change during the reactions.\n\n*   **Groups at the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *   **CIP Priority Order (Start):** The ester group outranks the acid group. So, Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`, Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, Priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, Priority 2) remains.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped (what was P1 is now P2, and what was P2 is now P1). A swap of two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n    *   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, Priority 2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, Priority 1) remains.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups does not change. The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and a rigorous application of stereochemical principles.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon-3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 is left unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  Acidic workup (`H⁺`) causes the hydroxyl group to attack the carboxylic acid, forming the lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (`BH₃`) is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is left unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  Acidic workup (`H⁺`) causes the new hydroxyl group to attack the ester, forming the lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Critical Step)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement of the groups (the configuration) is retained. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n1.  **Determine CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    *   `-H`\n    *   `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    *   `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    *   `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    By comparing the atoms moving away from the chiral center, the ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    The priority order is: **(1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-CH₂CH₃` > (4) `-H`**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry for Reaction A:**\n    *   The ester group (priority #1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The acid group (priority #2) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.

This means the reaction proceeds with **retention of the R/S descriptor**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1.

The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Overall Reaction:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). This creates a hydroxy-acid or a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes (via intramolecular esterification or transesterification) to form the lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry (The Critical Point)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the 3D arrangement of the atoms (the configuration) is retained. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If the chemical transformation changes the priority order of these groups, the R/S descriptor can change (e.g., from S to R) even though the configuration is retained.\n\n**Let's determine the CIP priorities for the groups attached to the chiral C3 in the starting material:**\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid side)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\nThe ester group has a higher priority than the acid group. Thus, the priority order is: **Ester side > Acid side > Ethyl > H**.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction A:**\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (priority 1) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Outcome:** The original priority 1 group becomes the new priority 2 group, and the original priority 2 group becomes the new priority 1 group.

Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed stereochemical analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--CH2--CH(Et)--CH2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                      |\n                    Chiral Center (C3)\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is understanding which functional group each reducing agent will attack.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to the lactone upon acidic workup.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point):** We must determine if the R/S designation of the chiral center changes. This depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) before and after the reaction.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to C3 are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The CIP priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (1)** > **-CH₂COOH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **In the Hydroxy-Acid Intermediate:** The -CH₂COOiBu group is converted to -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: **-CH₂COOH (1)** > **-CH₂CH₂OH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. When the priorities of two groups at a chiral center are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Path: (S)-A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol. The ester group at C5 is untouched.

This is a key principle in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Reaction A (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone)**: The ester group is reduced to an alcohol. A careful analysis of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center shows that the priority order changes during this transformation. Specifically, the group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes priority #2 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`), and the group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1. This swap results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R/S). Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n3.  **Reaction B (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone)**: The carboxylic acid group is reduced to an alcohol. A similar CIP analysis shows that the priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is **retained** during this transformation. The original priority #1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1, and the original priority #2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the new priority #2 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Therefore, to obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Both starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step analysis of reaction mechanisms, reagent selectivity, and stereochemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at C5.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--CH₂(2)--CH(3)--CH₂(4)--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone. The lactone is formed by creating a bond between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group and the carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid (or ester) in a single molecule.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reagent Selectivity and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThis is the first critical point. The two reducing agents have different selectivities.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Pathway:** The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is not reduced. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product.\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Pathway:** The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group at C5 is not reduced. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the same lactone product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle point of the problem. The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, and these priorities can change when the functional groups are modified.\n\n*   **Groups on the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Determining CIP Priorities:** Comparing the ester side and the acid side, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). Therefore, the initial priority order is: **(1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the stereochemical outcome for each reaction:\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction):**\n    *   The ester side (original priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The acid side (original priority 2) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped (original 1st priority group becomes 2nd, and original 2nd becomes 1st). Swapping the priority of two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration. (S)-A → (R)-Product.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reaction B (BH₃ reduction):**\n    *   The acid side (original priority 2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The ester side (original priority 1) remains `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration. (S)-B → (S)-Product.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of reagent selectivity and stereochemical changes:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code output provides a detailed analysis of the two chemical reactions, focusing on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\nHere is a summary of the final result:\n\n*   **Reaction A**: The starting material A is treated with LiBH₄, which selectively reduces the ester group. A stereochemical analysis reveals that the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities of the groups around the chiral center change in a way that inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B**: The starting material B is treated with BH₃, which selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group. The stereochemical analysis for this pathway shows that the priority order of the groups around the chiral center is maintained. This means the reaction proceeds with retention of the R/S designation. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration.\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

It has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--CH2--C(3)H--CH2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone. This lactone is formed by the cyclization of `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, the isobutyl ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reduction creates the intermediate `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The acidic workup (`H⁺`) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3), but we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to it change, as this can invert the R/S designation.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The two main groups attached to the chiral center are `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side) and `-CH₂COOH` (acid side). The ester side has a higher CIP priority than the acid side.\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The ester side is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher CIP priority than the alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center inverts its R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a highly selective reducing agent that reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reduction creates the intermediate `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. The acidic workup (`H⁺`) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We again check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The acid side is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher CIP priority than the newly formed alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with retention of the R/S designation. To obtain an **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A, the starting material must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction B, the starting material must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth A and B are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), followed by an intramolecular cyclization (either esterification or transesterification).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Critical Point)**\n\nThe reactions do not occur directly at the chiral center (C3). However, the chemical modification of the side chains attached to the chiral center can change their priority according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules, which can invert the R/S designation even if the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained.\n\nLet's determine the CIP priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center in the starting material:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n4.  `-H` (hydrogen)\n\nThe ester group has a higher priority than the acid group. So, the priority order is: **(1) > (2) > (3) > (4)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (original priority 1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original priority 2) remains.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** Let's re-evaluate the priorities in the hydroxy-acid intermediate. The groups are now `-CH₂COOH` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   New Priority Order: `-CH₂COOH` (new 1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3).\n    *   The original priority 1 group became the new priority 2 group, and the original priority 2 group became the new priority 1 group. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.\n    *   **Swapping the priorities of two groups inverts the R/S designation.**\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   (S)-A → [inversion of descriptor] → (R)-Product\n\n### **Step 5: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the acid group (original priority 2) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original priority 1) remains.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** Let's re-evaluate the priorities in the hydroxy-ester intermediate. The groups are now `-CH₂COOiBu` and `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   New Priority Order: `-CH₂COOiBu` (new 1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3).\n    *   The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center has not changed.\n    *   **The R/S designation is retained.**\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   (S)-B → [retention of descriptor] → (S)-Product\n\n### **Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of chemoselectivity and the change in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu). It also has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--CH2--CH(Et)--CH2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                      |\n                    Chiral Center (C3)\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is understanding which functional group each reducing agent will attack.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to the lactone upon acidic workup.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point):** We must determine if the R/S designation of the chiral center changes. This depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) before and after the reaction.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to C3 are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The CIP priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (1)** > **-CH₂COOH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **In the Hydroxy-Acid Intermediate:** The -CH₂COOiBu group is converted to -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: **-CH₂COOH (1)** > **-CH₂CH₂OH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. When the priorities of two groups at a chiral center are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Path: (S)-A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol. The ester group at C5 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, which undergoes transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point):** We again check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **In Starting Material B:** Priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (1)** > **-CH₂COOH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **In the Hydroxy-Ester Intermediate:** The -CH₂COOH group is converted to -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (1)** > **-CH₂CH₂OH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the groups has **not** changed. Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained**.\n    *   To obtain the **(S)-lactone** product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Path: (S)-B → (S)-Intermediate → (S)-Lactone.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).

This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups (acid or ester) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This creates a hydroxy-acid or hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes (via intramolecular esterification or transesterification) to form the lactone.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction A (with LiBH₄)\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reagent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.

However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change, as this can change the R/S designation.\n    *   **Groups at C3 (Start):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side) and `-CH₂COOH` (acid side). The ester side has higher priority than the acid side. Let's call them P1 and P2, respectively.\n    *   **Groups at C3 (After Reduction):** The ester side (P1) becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid side (P2) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The `-CH₂COOH` group now has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The original P1 group has become the new P2 group, and the original P2 group has become the new P1 group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.

Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3). The 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups. If the reaction changes the chemical nature of a group, its priority can change, which may in turn change the R/S label even if the 3D structure is retained.\n\n*   **Groups attached to the chiral center (C3):**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **CIP Priority Order:** The ester group outranks the acid group, which outranks the ethyl group.

Understanding the Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key features:\n    1.  Two different carbonyl functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** (`-COOH`) and an **isobutyl ester** (`-COOiBu`).\n    2.  A single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone.\n*   **Formation:** The lactone is formed by creating a bond between the oxygen of a hydroxyl group and the carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid (or ester) in the same molecule. This means the starting material must be converted into a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (or a derivative) which then cyclizes.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reagent Selectivity (Careful Point #1)**\n\nThis is the most critical aspect of the problem. The two reducing agents have different preferences.\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Tracing the Reaction Pathways**\n\n*   **Reaction A (A + LiBH₄):**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone. This pathway is chemically sound.\n\n*   **Reaction B (B + BH₃):**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is untouched.\n    3.  The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification (the new alcohol attacks the ester) to form the same lactone. This pathway is also chemically sound.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Stereochemistry (Careful Point #2)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the attached groups, which can change when the functional groups are modified.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The ester side (priority #1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid side (priority #2) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. Swapping two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n    *   The acid side (priority #2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester side (priority #1) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group.\n    *   The priority order of the groups is maintained. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5.

It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which bears the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity:**\n    *   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a well-known reagent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n    *   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemical Consequences (The Critical Point):**\n    The reactions occur at the functional groups, which are not directly attached to the chiral center. Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the R/S designation can change if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority ranking of the attached groups changes.\n\n    *   **CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid side chain (`-CH₂COOH`).\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   Priority 3: `-CH₂CH₃`\n\n4.  **Deduce Starting Material A:**\n    *   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ → (R)-product\n    *   **Transformation:** The ester group (Priority 1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n    *   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original Priority 1 group becomes a lower priority group, and the original Priority 2 group becomes the new Priority 1 group. This swap in the priority of the top two groups **inverts the R/S designation**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n5.  **Deduce Starting Material B:**\n    *   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ → (S)-product\n    *   **Transformation:** The acid group (Priority 2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n    *   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains the highest priority group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The priority ranking of the groups does not change. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of the R/S designation**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting Material A = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B. Most of the provided answers miss the subtle but crucial change in CIP priorities for Reaction A, leading them to an incorrect conclusion. The most rigorous analysis, which accounts for this change, correctly identifies both starting materials as the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid). It possesses two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at the C3 position, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone.\n*   **Transformation:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). This creates a hydroxy-acid or a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes (via intramolecular esterification or transesterification) to form the lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by `LiBH₄`.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `LiBH₄` reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate: `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy-acid to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (`BH₃`) is a highly selective reagent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while reducing esters much more slowly.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `BH₃` reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This forms an intermediate: `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Crucial Point)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the spatial arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if the priorities change during the reactions.\n\n*   **Groups at the chiral center (C3) in the starting material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n    *   **CIP Priority Order (Start):** The ester group outranks the acid group. So, Priority 1: `-CH₂COOiBu`, Priority 2: `-CH₂COOH`.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, Priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, Priority 2) remains.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped (what was P1 is now P2, and what was P2 is now P1). A swap of two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n    *   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, Priority 2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, Priority 1) remains.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups does not change. The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and a rigorous application of stereochemical principles.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon-3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n    ```\n          O                O\n         //               //\n    HO--C(1)--C(2)H2--C(3)H--C(4)H2--C(5)--O-iBu\n                        |\n                        Et  <-- Chiral Center\n    ```\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Pathways and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 is left unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  Acidic workup (`H⁺`) causes the hydroxyl group to attack the carboxylic acid, forming the lactone (intramolecular esterification).\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (`BH₃`) is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The ester group at C5 is left unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  Acidic workup (`H⁺`) causes the new hydroxyl group to attack the ester, forming the lactone (intramolecular transesterification).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Critical Step)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement of the groups (the configuration) is retained. However, the R/S designation can change if the reaction alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n\n1.  **Determine CIP Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral C3 are:\n    *   `-H`\n    *   `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    *   `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    *   `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    By comparing the atoms moving away from the chiral center, the ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    The priority order is: **(1) `-CH₂COOiBu` > (2) `-CH₂COOH` > (3) `-CH₂CH₃` > (4) `-H`**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry for Reaction A:**\n    *   The ester group (priority #1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The acid group (priority #2) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Outcome:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. Swapping the priorities of two groups **inverts the R/S descriptor** (e.g., an S starting material becomes an R intermediate and finally an R product).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemistry for Reaction B:**\n    *   The acid group (priority #2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The ester group (priority #1) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the `-CH₂COOiBu` group remains the highest priority group.\n    *   **Outcome:** The priority order of the groups does not change. This means the reaction proceeds with **retention of the R/S descriptor**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Structures and Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).

This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Overall Reaction:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). This creates a hydroxy-acid or a hydroxy-ester, which then cyclizes (via intramolecular esterification or transesterification) to form the lactone.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry (The Critical Point)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the 3D arrangement of the atoms (the configuration) is retained. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If the chemical transformation changes the priority order of these groups, the R/S descriptor can change (e.g., from S to R) even though the configuration is retained.\n\n**Let's determine the CIP priorities for the groups attached to the chiral C3 in the starting material:**\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester side)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (Acid side)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n4.  `-H`\nThe ester group has a higher priority than the acid group. Thus, the priority order is: **Ester side > Acid side > Ethyl > H**.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction A:**\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (priority 1) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Outcome:** The original priority 1 group becomes the new priority 2 group, and the original priority 2 group becomes the new priority 1 group. This swap in priorities **inverts the R/S descriptor**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Stereochemical Analysis of Reaction B:**\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (priority 2) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **New Priorities:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Outcome:** The priority order of the groups is **maintained**. This means the R/S descriptor is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed stereochemical analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).

The resulting hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is understanding which functional group each reducing agent will attack.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes to the lactone upon acidic workup.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point):** We must determine if the R/S designation of the chiral center changes. This depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) before and after the reaction.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to C3 are H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The CIP priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu (1)** > **-CH₂COOH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **In the Hydroxy-Acid Intermediate:** The -CH₂COOiBu group is converted to -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: **-CH₂COOH (1)** > **-CH₂CH₂OH (2)** > -CH₂CH₃ (3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. When the priorities of two groups at a chiral center are swapped, the R/S designation is **inverted**.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Path: (S)-A → (R)-Intermediate → (R)-Lactone.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol. The ester group at C5 is untouched.

This is a key principle in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Reaction A (A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone)**: The ester group is reduced to an alcohol. A careful analysis of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center shows that the priority order changes during this transformation. Specifically, the group that was priority #1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) becomes priority #2 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`), and the group that was priority #2 (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes priority #1. This swap results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R/S). Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n3.  **Reaction B (B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone)**: The carboxylic acid group is reduced to an alcohol. A similar CIP analysis shows that the priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is **retained** during this transformation. The original priority #1 group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) remains priority #1, and the original priority #2 group (`-CH₂COOH`) becomes the new priority #2 (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). Therefore, to obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Both starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step analysis of reaction mechanisms, reagent selectivity, and stereochemistry.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

The carboxylic acid at C1 is not reduced. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product.\n\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Pathway:** The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).

The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the same lactone product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle point of the problem. The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement of the atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, and these priorities can change when the functional groups are modified.\n\n*   **Groups on the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Determining CIP Priorities:** Comparing the ester side and the acid side, the ester group (`-COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). Therefore, the initial priority order is: **(1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H**.\n\nNow, let's analyze the stereochemical outcome for each reaction:\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction):**\n    *   The ester side (original priority 1) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The acid side (original priority 2) remains `-CH₂COOH`.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the `-CH₂COOH` group now has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped (original 1st priority group becomes 2nd, and original 2nd becomes 1st). Swapping the priority of two groups at a chiral center **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration. (S)-A → (R)-Product.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reaction B (BH₃ reduction):**\n    *   The acid side (original priority 2) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The ester side (original priority 1) remains `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has a higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. The reaction proceeds with **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration. (S)-B → (S)-Product.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of reagent selectivity and stereochemical changes:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code output provides a detailed analysis of the two chemical reactions, focusing on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\nHere is a summary of the final result:\n\n*   **Reaction A**: The starting material A is treated with LiBH₄, which selectively reduces the ester group. A stereochemical analysis reveals that the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities of the groups around the chiral center change in a way that inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B**: The starting material B is treated with BH₃, which selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group. The stereochemical analysis for this pathway shows that the priority order of the groups around the chiral center is maintained. This means the reaction proceeds with retention of the R/S designation. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the (S) configuration.\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of both the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3) and two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   **Product:** The product is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone).

The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, forming a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A.** The reaction does not break any bonds at the C3 chiral center, so the absolute configuration is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center.\n        *   In the starting material, the groups attached to C3 are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The ester-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid-containing side chain (`-CH₂COOH`).\n        *   In the intermediate hydroxy acid, the ester side chain has been reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. Now, the acid side chain (`-CH₂COOH`) has a higher priority than the new alcohol side chain (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        *   Because the priorities of the two main side chains have swapped, the R/S descriptor is **inverted** during this reaction sequence.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters intact.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, forming an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate intermediate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B.** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n        *   In the starting material, the ester side chain (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid side chain (`-CH₂COOH`).\n        *   In the intermediate hydroxy ester, the acid side chain has been reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester side chain remains the highest priority group attached to the chiral center.\n        *   Because the priority order of the groups does not change, the R/S descriptor is **retained** during this reaction sequence.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Overall Reaction:** To form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The core of the problem is to determine which reagent reduces which group and what the stereochemical consequence is.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  This forms the intermediate `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemical Consequence.** The reaction does not break any bonds at the C3 chiral center, so the 3D arrangement of atoms is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the attached groups, which may change.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH` (acid side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side). The ester side has a higher CIP priority than the acid side.\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The ester side is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher CIP priority than the reduced side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the two main side chains have swapped. Swapping the priorities of two groups at a chiral center *inverts* the R/S descriptor (e.g., an S-configured center becomes R-labeled).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  This forms the intermediate `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemical Consequence.** We perform the same CIP analysis.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`).\n    *   **In the intermediate:** The acid side is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the reduced side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. Therefore, the R/S descriptor is *retained*.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of chemoselectivity and stereochemical descriptors:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
