The stability of the resulting enol form is also a factor.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the double bonds (they are sp² hybridized).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These sp² hybridized alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms that can readily participate in tautomerization. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction, not tautomerism, because the molecular formula changes (C₆H₄O₂ vs. C₆H₆O₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketones (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons are sp³ hybridized and have hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is exceptionally stable due to being aromatic. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the Compound That Will Show Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Careful Point:** The key concept is chirality. A molecule is chiral and shows optical isomerism if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center Check:** The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Furthermore, it is a planar molecule that possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n**Decision for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a phenomenon where a chemical compound exists in two or more interconvertible isomeric forms. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton. A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite positions and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms that can easily participate in tautomerization. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction, not an isomerization, as their molecular formulas differ.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens and therefore **does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These CH₂ groups contain alpha-hydrogens which are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to form its highly stable aromatic enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it is an achiral molecule, dimethyl fumarate **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nThe question asks for two things:\n1.  **(A)** The compound that does **not** show tautomerism, from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n2.  **(B)** The compound that **will** show optical isomerism, from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A crucial requirement for this process is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for easy tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is exceptionally stable due to being aromatic. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers. Any molecule with a plane or center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n**A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on the provided answers.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n*   **Goal:** To identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Key Concept:** Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common form, requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).

The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton. A key requirement for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n1.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzoquinone has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite positions and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms that can easily participate in tautomerization. The conversion of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) is a reduction, not an isomerization, as their molecular formulas differ.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens and therefore **does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These CH₂ groups contain alpha-hydrogens which are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo tautomerization to form its highly stable aromatic enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules.

A crucial requirement for this process is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the typical alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon required for easy tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n**Key Concept:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process generally requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, known as an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These α-hydrogens are available to participate in tautomerization. In fact, this compound readily tautomerizes to form its highly stable enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds. These alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no α-hydrogens, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**Key Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. As it is an achiral molecule, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral. Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the provided options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical properties of the given compounds is necessary. The question is divided into two parts.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nThis part asks to identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Key Concept:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, known as tautomers, are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are situated between carbonyl groups.\n    *   These carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two α-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The resulting enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have any α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon, which are typically required for keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction reaction (gain of two protons and two electrons), not an isomerization, as the molecular formula changes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThis part asks to identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Key Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n    *   The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it lacks a chiral center.\n    *   Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
