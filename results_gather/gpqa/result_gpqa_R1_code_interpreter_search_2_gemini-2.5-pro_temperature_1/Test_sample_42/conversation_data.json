    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Structure and Substituents**\n*   The core is a **benzene ring**.\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid: -COOH\n    *   Carbaldehyde (formyl): -CHO\n    *   Cyano (nitrile): -CN\n    *   Hydroxyl (alcohol): -OH\n    *   Dimethylamino: -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   Methoxy: -OCH₃\n\n**2. Determine the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, functional groups are prioritized to determine the parent name. The priority order for the given groups is:\nCarboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether\nSince the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the number **1**.\n\n**3. Draw the Structure Based on Relative Positions**\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring starting with the principal group at C1.\n*   **C1**: -COOH\n*   \"**para** to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **C4** has **-OCH₃**.\n*   \"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all **meta** to one another\": The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5.\n*   \"**Ortho** to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at C2 and C6.\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both **ortho** to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to place the remaining groups unambiguously.\n    *   Methoxy is fixed at C4.\n    *   Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. We already have methoxy at C4. For the statement to be true, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C2**.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. We have methoxy at C4. For the statement to be true, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C6**.\n\n    *   Let's proceed with Case 1. If -OH is at C2, then the other ortho group, dimethylamino, must be at **C6**. The remaining meta group, carbaldehyde, must be at **C5**.\n    *   Let's check if Case 2 is different. If -OH is at C6, then dimethylamino is at C2. If nitrile is at C5, then carbaldehyde is at C3. This structure is the enantiomer (a non-superimposable mirror image) of the structure from Case 1. For naming purposes without stereochemistry, both will result in the same name because IUPAC rules will dictate a single preferred numbering system.\n\nSo, the unique constitutional structure is:\n*   **C1**: -COOH\n*   **C2**: -OH\n*   **C3**: -CN\n*   **C4**: -OCH₃\n*   **C5**: -CHO\n*   **C6**: -N(CH₃)₂\n\n**4. Number the Ring According to IUPAC Rules**\n*   The principal group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   We need to number the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n    *   Numbering clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both directions give the identical locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: Choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In the clockwise numbering scheme (C2=-OH, C3=-CN...), **cyano gets locant 3**.\n    *   In the counter-clockwise numbering scheme (C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH₃, C5=-CN...), **cyano gets locant 5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering is correct**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct (clockwise) numbering, we have:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\nNow, list these alphabetically and add the parent name at the end.\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect because the prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect because it uses the wrong numbering direction and has incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect because it uses the wrong numbering direction (which gives a higher number to 'cyano').\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
