    "This is a common piece of slang used in organic chemistry labs. Let's break down the meaning.\n\n1.  **Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. In this environment, chemists synthesize new molecules. A crucial part of this process is purification, which means separating the desired product from any unreacted starting materials, byproducts, or solvents.\n\n2.  **The Phrase:** \"My compounds are on top of each other\" is a figurative expression. It refers to a failure to separate different chemical compounds during an analytical or purification process.\n\n3.  **Common Purification/Analytical Technique:** The most common technique used daily in these labs for both monitoring reactions and purifying mixtures is **chromatography**, particularly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography.\n\n4.  **How Chromatography Works:** Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (like silica gel, which is very polar) and a mobile phase (a solvent or solvent mixture). A compound's speed through the chromatograph (either up a TLC plate or down a column) is primarily determined by its **polarity**.\n    *   Less polar compounds interact weakly with the polar stationary phase and are carried along quickly by the mobile phase.\n    *   More polar compounds interact strongly with the stationary phase and move more slowly.\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Phrase:**\n    *   On a TLC plate, separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at almost the same speed and their spots will overlap, appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   Similarly, in column chromatography, if compounds have similar polarities, they will exit (elute from) the column at the same time, making their separation impossible.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Similar boiling points are a problem for purification by distillation, not typically described with this phrase.\n    *   B) Optical rotation is a property of a single chiral compound (or a mixture) and is not a separation technique.\n    *   **C) Similar polarities are the direct cause of compounds failing to separate during chromatography, leading to the spots or elution bands being \"on top of each other.\" This is the most common and accurate interpretation of the chemist's complaint.**\n    *   D) While non-covalent interactions are the underlying physical basis for polarity, the specific property that governs separation in chromatography is polarity itself. \"Similar polarities\" is a more precise and direct answer to why the compounds are not separating.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is almost certainly complaining that their desired product and an impurity (like a starting material or byproduct) have very similar polarities, making them difficult or impossible to separate using chromatography.\n\n<<<C>>>"
