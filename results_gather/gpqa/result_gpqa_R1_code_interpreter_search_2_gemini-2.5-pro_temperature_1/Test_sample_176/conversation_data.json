    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2, which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star 2, so $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, or $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Squaring this ratio gives:\n    $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    So, the luminosity ratio is:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Relate Temperature to Wavelength:** Wien's displacement law relates a star's temperature to the rest-frame wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{rest}$). The law is:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{rest}$\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$).\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures can be expressed as:\n    $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,2} / \\lambda_{rest,1}$\n    And the fourth power of this ratio is:\n    $(T_1/T_2)^4 = (\\lambda_{rest,2} / \\lambda_{rest,1})^4$\n\n6.  **Connect Rest Wavelength to Observed Wavelength:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$. We need to account for the Doppler shift due to the stars' radial velocities to find their rest-frame wavelengths.\n    -   **For Star 1:** The radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$. There is no Doppler shift, so the observed wavelength is equal to the rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    -   **For Star 2:** The radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. By convention in astronomy, a positive radial velocity indicates the object is receding (moving away), causing a redshift. The observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v/c)$\n        So, for Star 2: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n\n7.  **Find the Ratio of Rest Wavelengths:** Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can set the expressions for them equal:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$\n    Rearranging this to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,2} / \\lambda_{rest,1} = 1 / (1 + v_2/c)$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now substitute this back into the equations from steps 4 and 5:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (\\lambda_{rest,2} / \\lambda_{rest,1})^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_2/c))^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 + v_2/c)^{-4}$\n\n9.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** We will now use a Python script to compute the final value with high precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given values\nR_ratio = 1.5  # R1/R2\nv2 = 700.0  # km/s\nc = 299792.458  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the square of the radius ratio\nR_ratio_sq = R_ratio**2\n\n# Calculate the v/c ratio for Star 2\nv_over_c = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio using the derived formula\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (1 + v2/c)^(-4)\nluminosity_ratio = R_ratio_sq * (1 + v_over_c)**(-4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229100140225695\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.2291. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe result 2.2291 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>",
