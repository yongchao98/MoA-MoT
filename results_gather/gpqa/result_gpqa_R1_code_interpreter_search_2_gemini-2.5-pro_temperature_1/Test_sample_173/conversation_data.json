    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the initial and final states**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is 300 GeV, and its initial momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`, and kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`. We are told `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n\n**2. Determine the masses and energy release**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. This is interpreted as `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Let's convert this to rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2`.\n*   Substituting the given values: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n\n*   **Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy):** The total kinetic energy released is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n    *   `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum was zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   For our fragments:\n    *   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n    *   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   Take the ratio: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2_classical`: `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) value of T1**\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is also `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting for E: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding the left side: `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore: `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   We know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Let's solve for T1.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variable for the kinetic energy of the first fragment\nT1 = sympy.Symbol('T1')\n\n# Rest mass energies in GeV\nm1c2 = 198\nm2c2 = 99\n\n# Total kinetic energy in GeV\nQ = 3\n\n# Kinetic energy of the second fragment\nT2 = Q - T1\n\n# Relativistic momentum squared equation: p1^2*c^2 = p2^2*c^2\n# (pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2\neq = sympy.Eq(T1**2 + 2*T1*m1c2, T2**2 + 2*T2*m2c2)\n\n# Solve the equation for T1\nsolution = sympy.solve(eq, T1)\nT1_relativistic = solution[0]\n\n# Classical T1 value\nT1_classical = 1.0 # GeV\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 is: {T1_relativistic:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The classical kinetic energy T1 is: {T1_classical:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The difference is: {difference_mev:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nThe correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 is: 1.0050 GeV\nThe classical kinetic energy T1 is: 1.0000 GeV\nThe difference is: 5.0 MeV\n\n**5. Find the difference**\n\n*   The correct relativistic value for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T1 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The classically calculated value is `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV`.\n*   The difference is `ΔT1 = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Converting this to Mega-electron Volts (MeV): `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",

What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?\n\n(Ignore the electrons.)\n\n**1. Determine the initial and final rest-mass energies and the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let the rest masses of the two fragments be `m1` and `m2`, with `m1` being the more massive fragment.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`. Therefore, their rest-mass energies are related by `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    Multiplying by c^2, we get the sum of their rest-mass energies:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we can solve for the individual rest-mass energies:\n    *   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` into the sum equation:\n        `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n    *   Now find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n        `m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy:\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the fragments must also be zero. This means they fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   So, `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2_classical`:\n    `T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) value of T1.**\n\n*   In special relativity, the relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c^2) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2` (kinetic energy + rest-mass energy).\n*   Substituting this into the relation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding and simplifying gives an expression for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since momentum is conserved (`p1 = p2`), we can equate their `(p*c)^2` values:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   We know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. We can now solve for the relativistic T1:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**4. Find the difference.**\n\n*   Correct (relativistic) value: `T1 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   Classical approximation: `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV`.\n*   The difference is `ΔT1 = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
