    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Energy Levels of the System:**\n    The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 * (\\pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)$\n    where n is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    The problem defines the unit of energy as $E = (\\pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    $E_n = n^2 * E$\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    The problem states we have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For a particle in this potential well, a state is defined by its energy level (n) and its spin (spin up, $m_s = +1/2$, or spin down, $m_s = -1/2$). This means that each energy level $E_n$ can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n3.  **Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1. We place 2 particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   The next available energy level is n=2. We place the remaining 2 particles in this level.\n    The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E)$\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n4.  **First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    The first excited state is created by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n    The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E)$\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n5.  **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n    *   **Excitation 1:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Excitation 2:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Excitation 3:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
