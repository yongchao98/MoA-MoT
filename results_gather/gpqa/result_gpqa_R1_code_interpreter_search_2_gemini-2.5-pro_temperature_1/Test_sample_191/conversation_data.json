    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed *inside* the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction:** According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge $+q$ will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** The positive charge $+q$ will attract negative charges. A total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This induced charge $-q$ will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of $+q$ must appear somewhere else on the conductor to maintain its overall charge neutrality. This $+q$ charge will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor are shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity. Conversely, any point outside the conductor is shielded from the direct influence of the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner wall). The electric field outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface, regardless of the position or shape of the cavity or the position of the charge $+q$ within it. This is because the conducting material shields the outer surface from the non-uniform fields inside.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at any point outside the shell is the same as the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated as a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{(\\text{charge on outer surface})}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its center's offset ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all extraneous information. The principle of electrostatic shielding simplifies the problem significantly. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the net charge that resides on its outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
