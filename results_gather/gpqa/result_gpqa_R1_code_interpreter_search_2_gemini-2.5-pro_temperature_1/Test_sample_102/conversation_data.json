    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   It has a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all meta to each other.\n*   Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n\nThe challenge is to install these three groups in the correct 1,3,5-positions. The presence of an ortho,para-directing group (-Br) meta to two other groups suggests a complex synthesis, likely involving the introduction and later removal of a directing group. The provided options are all multi-step sequences, confirming this complexity.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A, B, C, D)**\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n*   **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product).** The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   **iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** This reaction fails or gives a very low yield. The benzene ring is strongly deactivated by both a bromo group and a nitro group, making it unsuitable for Friedel-Crafts acylation. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene.** This sequence of reactions simply converts benzene back to benzene, making it a futile and incorrect pathway.\n\n**Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** This step is highly problematic. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivated anilinium complex (-NH3+), which prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction on the ring. The reaction would fail. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\nThis sequence is more complex and requires careful analysis. The final steps (iv-vii) involve the reduction of a nitro group to an amine, followed by another reaction, and then the removal of that amine group via diazotization and deamination. This is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis. Let's trace the steps:\n\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The m-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This is a standard electrophilic bromination.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n    *   -COCH3 at C1 is a meta-director (directs to C5).\n    *   -Br at C3 is an ortho,para-director (directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    The directing groups are in conflict. However, the ortho,para-directing effect of the halogen usually directs the substitution to the positions it activates (C2, C4, C6). The position ortho to bromine and para to the acetyl group (C4) is sterically accessible and electronically favorable. So, the major product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This is not the final product, but a key intermediate.\n*   **iv) 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group.\n*   **v) 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** Now we nitrate this new intermediate. Let's check the directing effects:\n    *   **-NH2 (amino) at C4:** Strongly activating, o,p-director. Directs to C3 (blocked by Br) and C5.\n    *   **-Br (bromo) at C3:** Deactivating, o,p-director. Directs to C1 (blocked by acetyl) and C5.\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl) at C1:** Deactivating, m-director. Directs to C3 (blocked by Br) and C5.\n    All three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C5. This is a very effective and high-yield step, producing **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **vi) 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The amino group at C4 is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, uses a clever directing group strategy to overcome the initial conflicting directing effects, and ultimately leads to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product in high yield.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing all the options, sequence B provides a logical and well-established synthetic route to the target molecule, employing advanced tactics like using a substituent as a temporary directing group which is later removed.\n\n<<<B>>>"
