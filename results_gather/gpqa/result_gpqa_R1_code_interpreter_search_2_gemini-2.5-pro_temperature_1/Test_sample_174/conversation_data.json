    "An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The properties of this radiation depend on the nature of the oscillation. The problem asks for the angular distribution of the radiated power and its dependence on the wavelength. We can analyze this by considering the multipole expansion of the radiation field.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Physical Model of the Radiating Source:**\n    The problem describes \"an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This can be interpreted in a few ways, but the most common sources of radiation are oscillating electric dipoles, magnetic dipoles, electric quadrupoles, etc.\n    *   **Electric Dipole Model:** If the center of the charge distribution oscillates along the z-axis, or if there is an internal \"sloshing\" of charge along the z-axis, the system will possess a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)` aligned with the z-axis. This is the simplest and most common type of radiation from a localized, non-spherically-symmetric oscillating source.\n    *   **Electric Quadrupole Model:** If the oscillation consists of a change in the shape of the spheroid (e.g., from prolate to oblate) while keeping the center of charge fixed, the electric dipole moment would be zero. The first non-vanishing radiating multipole would be the electric quadrupole.\n\n    In the absence of specific information forcing the dipole moment to be zero, the principle of considering the most dominant, lowest-order effect applies. The power radiated by higher-order multipoles is suppressed by additional factors of `(R/λ)²`, where `R` is the size of the source and `λ` is the wavelength. For a source smaller than the wavelength (`R << λ`), the electric dipole radiation will be far stronger than the quadrupole radiation. Therefore, the most reasonable model is the electric dipole.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Dipole):**\n    For an oscillating electric dipole with its moment `p` aligned along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` in the radiation zone is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the z-axis, and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude and the frequency.\n\n    The function `f` in the question represents this quantity: `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`.\n    The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\n    We need to find the fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°`.\n    At `θ = 30°`, the power is:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    So, `(dP/dΩ)_30° = A * (1/4)`.\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Dipole):**\n    The full formula for the power per unit solid angle is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `c` is the speed of light, and `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.\n\n    The radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    So, a possible form for the function `f` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the characteristic dependence for electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining our findings:\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   The radiated power `f` has a dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n*(For completeness, if we had assumed an electric quadrupole model, the angular dependence would be `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and the wavelength dependence `λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of 3/4 at 30°, matching option D. However, as argued above, the dipole model is the most natural and dominant interpretation.)*\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script verifies the fraction calculation for the electric dipole radiation model.\n\n# The power radiated per unit solid angle for an electric dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power (A) occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n# We want to find the power at theta = 30 degrees as a fraction of the maximum power A.\n\ntheta_degrees = 30\ntheta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(30)\nvalue_at_30_deg = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n\n# The maximum value is sin^2(90) = 1.\n# The fraction is value_at_30_deg / 1.\nfraction = value_at_30_deg\n\nprint(f\"Angle: {theta_degrees} degrees\")\nprint(f\"sin({theta_degrees}) = {math.sin(theta_radians)}\")\nprint(f\"sin^2({theta_degrees}) = {value_at_30_deg}\")\nprint(f\"The fraction of the maximum power is: {fraction}\")\nprint(f\"As a simple fraction, this is 1/4.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The most fundamental type of radiation from a localized oscillating source is electric dipole radiation, which we will assume is the dominant mechanism unless stated otherwise.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` in the question represents this power per unit solid angle.\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted by `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nTherefore, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of this maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can calculate this by substituting `θ = 30°` into the formula:\n`(dP/dΩ)` at `30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSquaring this value, we get `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at `30°` is `A * (1/4)`. The fraction of the maximum power is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`:\n`P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ` also has this dependence:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThus, a possible form for the function `f` includes a dependence on `λ⁻⁴`. This characteristic `λ⁻⁴` dependence is famously associated with electric dipole radiation and Rayleigh scattering.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
