    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    For a circular orbit, this simplifies. More commonly, the formula is expressed in terms of the star's luminosity (L_star), but can be simplified for ratios:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(a)\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to calculate the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 - A4)^(1/4) / sqrt(a4) ] / [ (1 - A2)^(1/4) / sqrt(a2) ]\n\n4.  **Apply Given Conditions:**\n    *   The planets orbit the same star.\n    *   The problem states they have the same albedo, so A4 = A2.\n    *   Because the albedos are the same, the term (1 - A)^(1/4) cancels out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Temperature Ratio:** After canceling terms, the ratio simplifies to:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4) = sqrt(a2 / a4)\n\n6.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** To find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a4), we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    This can be written as P^2 / a^3 = constant.\n    Therefore, for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    P2^2 / a2^3 = P4^2 / a4^3\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** Rearrange the equation from Kepler's Law to solve for a2 / a4:\n    a2^3 / a4^3 = P2^2 / P4^2\n    (a2 / a4)^3 = (P2 / P4)^2\n    a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n8.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the expression for (a2 / a4) back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n9.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can determine the ratio P2 / P4:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the value of P2 / P4 into the final equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n    4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4 is given.\nP2_ratio_val = 2\nP4_ratio_val = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of their periods is P2/P4.\nperiod_ratio_p2_over_p4 = P2_ratio_val / P4_ratio_val\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is related to the period ratio by (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n# Derivation:\n# T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\n# From Kepler's 3rd Law, a ∝ P^(2/3)\n# Substituting a into the T_eq proportionality: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)\n# So, T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemp_ratio = period_ratio_p2_over_p4**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\n0.8298642281896895\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.69\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis (a), assuming the albedo and stellar properties are constant.\nT_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\nP² ∝ a³\nThis implies a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nWe can substitute this relationship into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) )^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\nP2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4/7)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThe result is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
