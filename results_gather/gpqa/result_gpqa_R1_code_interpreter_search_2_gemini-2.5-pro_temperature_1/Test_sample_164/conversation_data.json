    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The user wants to create a polymer with \"regular branches\" using only ethylene as a reactant. This requires a dual-catalyst system where one catalyst performs selective oligomerization of ethylene into a specific short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., 1-hexene), and the second catalyst copolymerizes ethylene with this newly formed alpha-olefin. The resulting polymer is a type of Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE). The question asks to identify the one correct statement among the four provided by a senior scientist.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Statement A: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals (like palladium, Pd) and other late transition metals (like nickel, Ni) are known to catalyze ethylene oligomerization or polymerization in laboratory settings.\n    *   These metals are significantly more expensive than chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), or zirconium (Zr) used in industrial bulk polymerization.\n    *   However, the context is a *dual catalyst system*. It is a major chemical challenge to find two different catalysts that can operate efficiently in the same reactor without poisoning each other. For instance, the ligands required for a noble metal catalyst might inhibit the polymerization catalyst, or the aluminum-based activator for the polymerization catalyst might deactivate the noble metal catalyst.\n    *   Therefore, while such catalysts exist for the individual reactions, stating they \"can be used\" in the required combined system is questionable and likely false in a practical sense, as compatibility is not guaranteed and is in fact a huge obstacle.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Statement B: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   This refers to tandem catalysis in a single reactor.\n    *   This technology is well-established and commercially successful. A prime example is the UNIPOL™ PE process from Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil Chemical).\n    *   This process uses dual-catalyst systems (for example, a chromium-based catalyst for ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene, and a metallocene or Ziegler-Natta catalyst for the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene).\n    *   Univation Technologies is a US-based company, and these processes are implemented in large-scale polyethylene plants in the US.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is factually correct.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Statement C: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene.\n    *   The catalysts used for both oligomerization (e.g., Cr-based) and polymerization (e.g., Ziegler-Natta or metallocene) almost universally require an activator, also known as a cocatalyst.\n    *   The most common and effective activators are aluminum-based compounds, such as alkylaluminums (e.g., triethylaluminum, TEAL) and aluminoxanes (e.g., methylaluminoxane, MAO). They are crucial for activating the transition metal center.\n    *   The statement that they \"do not work\" is factually incorrect; they are in fact essential.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Statement D: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   The key catalysts for selective ethylene oligomerization (e.g., to 1-hexene) are based on Chromium (Cr).\n    *   Chromium (Cr) is in Group 6 of the periodic table.\n    *   The notation \"Group VIa\" is an older system. In both the standard old IUPAC and the CAS (American) systems, Group VIA refers to the chalcogens (Group 16: Oxygen, Sulfur, etc.), which are non-metals or metalloids, not the target transition metals. The chromium group (Group 6) is designated as Group VIB in these systems.\n    *   Since there are no transition metals in Group VIa, the statement is chemically incorrect based on standard nomenclature. The scientist likely meant Group VIB but used incorrect notation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Statement A is likely incorrect in the context of a working dual-catalyst system due to incompatibility issues.\n*   Statement C is factually incorrect as aluminum activators are essential.\n*   Statement D is factually incorrect due to standard chemical notation (VIa vs. VIB).\n*   Statement B is a factually correct description of the industrial status of this exact technology in the US.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
