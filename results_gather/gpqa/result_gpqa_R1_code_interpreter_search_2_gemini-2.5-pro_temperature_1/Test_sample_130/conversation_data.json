    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR. This spectroscopic data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinyl protons, giving a single ¹H NMR peak (δ ≈ 7.0 ppm).\n    *   Due to symmetry, it has two types of carbon atoms: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, resulting in two ¹³C NMR peaks. The chemical shifts are characteristic for these functional groups.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (C1=C2-C3=C4).\n    *   There are methyl groups on each of the four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4).\n    *   The fifth carbon of the ring (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n*   **The Stereochemistry (Endo/Exo Isomers):** Diels-Alder reactions often produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The formation of a major and minor product indicates that both are formed, with one being favored.\n    *   The **Endo Rule** states that the kinetically favored product (usually the major product, especially at lower temperatures) is the *endo* isomer. In this isomer, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *anti* to the shortest bridge of the bicyclic system (the C5-CH₂ group). This orientation allows for favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n    *   The **Exo** isomer is typically the thermodynamically more stable but kinetically disfavored (minor) product. Here, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Structure of the Products:** The reaction yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Let's determine the substitution pattern based on the reactants:\n    *   The C1, C2, C3, and C4 atoms of the diene and the two alkene carbons of maleic anhydride form the new six-membered ring.\n    *   The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system.\n    *   The C1 and C4 atoms of the diene become the bridgehead carbons. They each carry a methyl group.\n    *   A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the diene. These carbons each carry a methyl group.\n    *   The maleic anhydride part is fused to the C5 and C6 positions of the new bicyclic system. These carbons each have a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the sum of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ from the diene and C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride).\n\n**3. Analyze the NMR Spectra and NOESY Data**\n\n*   **Symmetry and ¹H NMR Prediction:** The product molecule (both endo and exo isomers) possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C7-CH₂ bridge and the anhydride oxygen. This simplifies the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n    1.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) are equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, expected around **δ ≈ 1.0 ppm**.\n    2.  **Alkene Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond (C2, C3) are also equivalent. This gives another **6H singlet**. Being on a double bond, their shift will be further downfield, around **δ ≈ 1.7 ppm**.\n    3.  **Methine Protons:** The two protons on the carbons from the maleic anhydride (C5, C6) are equivalent. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, so they will be significantly deshielded, around **δ ≈ 3.5 ppm**. Since their neighbors (the bridgehead carbons) have no protons, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    4.  **Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the C7-CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic (one *syn* and one *anti* to the C2=C3 double bond) and will likely appear as a complex multiplet or two doublets of doublets, integrating to 2H total. One of these might appear as a doublet around **δ ≈ 1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **NOESY Analysis (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy):** A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a key cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This must arise from a unique spatial relationship in the major (endo) isomer.\n\n    *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *anti* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the methine protons (from the anhydride, δ ≈ 3.5 ppm) on the same face of the molecule as the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, these methine protons are spatially close to the alkene methyl groups (δ ≈ 1.7 ppm). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between the methine protons and the alkene methyl protons.**\n\n    *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is *syn* to the CH₂ bridge. This places the methine protons far away from the alkene methyl groups. No NOE is expected between them. Instead, the methine protons are now close to the CH₂ bridge protons.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present only in the major product connects the methine protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n**4. Match with the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (methine protons) and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (alkene methyls).\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`). This interaction is not unique to the major product.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_alkene`). This interaction is also not unique to the major product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_alkene`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_methine`). This matches our conclusion for the unique NOE in the major (endo) product.**\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_bridge`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_methine`). This interaction is characteristic of the minor (exo) product, not the major one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
