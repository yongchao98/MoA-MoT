    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. We will do this by translating the beginning of the DNA sequence for the intact gene and each mutant into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base-pair codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis**\n\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine\n*   **Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...\n    *   **Change:** `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (`TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phe, so this is a silent mutation).\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (`CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine. This is a missense mutation, changing one amino acid for another).\n    *   **Effect:** A single amino acid change (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed to inactivate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...\n    *   **Change:** `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Silent mutation).\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP** (`TAA` is one of the three stop codons).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene (at the third codon). This will cause the ribosome to terminate translation, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the final compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...\n    *   **Change:** `CTC` -> `TAC` and `ACT` -> `GTC` (based on alignment with the full intact sequence).\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr).\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n        *   `GGT` -> Glycine\n        *   `GTC` -> Valine (Missense mutation: Thr -> Val).\n    *   **Effect:** Two missense mutations. While two amino acid changes are more likely to be disruptive than one, it's still not as certain to cause complete loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n    *   **Change:** Comparing to the intact gene (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...`), we see `CTC` changes to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and the `GGT` codon is deleted entirely.\n    *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion of one codon (`GGT`, which codes for Glycine), plus a missense mutation. Removing an entire amino acid will alter the protein's structure and is likely to be damaging. However, a premature stop codon right at the beginning of the sequence is generally considered a more surefire way to create a non-functional \"null\" allele.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) at the very beginning of the coding sequence. This will lead to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way among the given options to completely eliminate the gene's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.\"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Process the sequence in codons (3 bases)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - (len(dna_sequence) % 3), 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codon\n        protein += amino_acid + \"-\"\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            break\n    return protein.strip('-')\n\n# DNA sequences from the problem (first 21 bases)\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT\"\n# Full sequences for 3 and 4 to show the deletions/changes properly\nintact_full = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" # Has extra base, let's analyze the codons directly as in text.\nmutant_4_snippet = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT\" # Corresponds to ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT -> GGT deleted\n\n# For mutant 3, it seems there's a typo in the provided sequence length.

    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. This type of mutation is often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence by translating the DNA codons.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence is:\n**5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’**\n\nTranslated into amino acids, this becomes:\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `CTC` -> Leucine\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   `GGT` -> Glycine\n**Protein sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - ...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is replaced by another.\n*   Effect: The protein will have a single amino acid change near the beginning. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n*   Effect: When the ribosome translates the mRNA, it will encounter the stop codon `TAA` and terminate protein synthesis. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This severely truncated protein will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’`\n*   Change: This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**.\n*   Effect: The resulting protein has two amino acid substitutions. While more disruptive than a single substitution, it's still not as certain to cause a complete loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n*   Change: Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see `CTC` has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and the codon `GGT` has been deleted entirely.\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation combined with an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly 3 nucleotides). Removing an entire amino acid from the protein chain is highly likely to be detrimental to its function. However, a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2, is generally considered a more surefire method for creating a non-functional protein because it halts synthesis entirely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 introduces a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon) very early in the coding sequence. This will result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most definitive way among the choices to knock out the gene's function and therefore eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
