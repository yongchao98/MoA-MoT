    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define λ1:** The initial state involves a vacuum with a small number of residual gas molecules. λ1 represents the mean free path of these gas molecules. This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The formula for this is approximately λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁), where 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules and σ₁ is the kinetic collision cross-section for gas-gas collisions. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Analyze the effect of the electron beam:** When the high-energy (1000 kV) electron beam is turned on, the electrons travel through the residual gas. These electrons have more than enough energy to knock electrons out of the gas molecules, a process called inelastic scattering or ionization. This creates positive ions within the gas.\n\n3.  **Define λ2:** Mike observes a new mean free path, λ2, under these new conditions. The question is, what mean free path is this? There are two main interpretations:\n    *   **Interpretation A:** λ2 is the mean free path of the electrons as they travel through the gas.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** λ2 is the new mean free path of the gas molecules, now that the gas is partially ionized.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Interpretation A:** The mean free path of an electron (λ_e) would be given by λ_e = 1 / (n * σ_e), where σ_e is the electron-gas scattering cross-section. An electron is a point-like particle, and an atom/molecule is mostly empty space. Therefore, the effective target area an atom presents to a tiny, high-energy electron (σ_e) is much, much smaller than the effective target area it presents to another molecule of similar size (σ₁). Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, a much smaller cross-section (σ_e << σ₁) would lead to a much larger mean free path (λ_e >> λ₁). This would make options like B (`λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`) seem plausible, but the actual ratio would be very large, not just slightly over 1.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Interpretation B:** This interpretation considers the effect of the beam *on the gas itself*. The \"intriguing observation\" is about how the properties of the gas have changed. The presence of newly created ions changes the interactions between the gas particles.\n    *   Now, a neutral gas molecule can collide with another neutral molecule (with cross-section σ₁) or with a positive ion.\n    *   The collision between a charged ion and a neutral molecule is governed by a long-range electrostatic force (the ion induces a dipole in the neutral molecule). This force is significantly stronger and has a longer range than the weak van der Waals forces between two neutral molecules.\n    *   Because of this stronger, long-range interaction, the collision cross-section between an ion and a neutral molecule (σ_ion-neutral) is considerably larger than the neutral-neutral cross-section (σ₁).\n    *   The overall mean free path of a gas molecule is determined by the sum of all possible collisions. Since a new collision type with a larger cross-section is introduced, the overall probability of a collision per unit distance increases.\n    *   An increased collision probability means a shorter average distance between collisions.\n    *   Therefore, the new mean free path of the gas molecules, λ2, will be shorter than the original mean free path, λ1.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Interpretation B provides a more complete and physically nuanced explanation of the scenario described. The introduction of the electron beam ionizes the gas, which increases the effective collision cross-section for the gas molecules, thereby decreasing their mean free path.\n\n    Therefore, we can conclude that λ₂ < λ₁.\n\n<<<C>>>"
