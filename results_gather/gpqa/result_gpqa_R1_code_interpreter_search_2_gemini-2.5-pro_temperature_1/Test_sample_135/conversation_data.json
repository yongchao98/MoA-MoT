    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`.\n*   The integral is: `I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n*   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n*   The vector field `f` is given by its magnitude `|f| = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r, θ, φ) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume.\n\nMathematically:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nThis theorem is particularly useful here because the vector field has a singularity at the origin (`r = 0`), which makes calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` at that point problematic. By converting the volume integral to a surface integral, we only need to evaluate the field `f` on the surface of the sphere (where `r = R > 0`), thus avoiding the singularity.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem: `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **The Surface `S`**: This is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **The Vector Field `f` on the Surface**: On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field on the surface is:\n    `f(R, θ, φ) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n*   **The Differential Surface Area Vector `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` always points in the radially outward direction. Therefore, `dS` is parallel to `r_hat`. Its magnitude is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n`f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n\nSince `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1` (the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1), the expression simplifies:\n`f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This is a key feature for `1/r^2` fields and means the result will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate the result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ) * (∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ)`\n\nLet's evaluate each integral separately:\n*   **Integral over `φ`**:\n    `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n*   **Integral over `θ`**:\n    `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = (-cos(π)) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nNow, multiply the results:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThe value of the integral is `4π`. This matches option D.\n\n*(Alternative perspective: The divergence of the field `f = r_hat / r^2` is actually `4πδ(r)`, where `δ(r)` is the 3D Dirac delta function. The integral of the Dirac delta function over a volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore, `∫_V 4πδ(r) dV = 4π`, which confirms the result.)*\n\n<<<D>>>"
