    "This problem requires us to apply the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots compared to when it does not.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem assumes the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n    \n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    \n    Where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (2) and lower energy level (1), respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the gas.\n\n2.  **Define the two scenarios:** We have two states for the star's photosphere:\n    *   **No spots:** The temperature is T_no_spots = 6000 K.\n    *   **With spots:** The overall effective temperature is T_spots = 5500 K.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratios for both scenarios:**\n    Let's denote the ratio N₂/N₁ as `Ratio`.\n    *   `Ratio_no_spots` = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_no_spots))\n    *   `Ratio_spots` = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n4.  **Determine the desired factor:** The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes, which is the ratio of the two ratios:\n    \n    Factor = `Ratio_no_spots` / `Ratio_spots`\n    \n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_no_spots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n    \n    The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n    \n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_no_spots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n    \n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    \n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a photon with a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference between the levels:\n    \n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    \n    Where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n6.  **Substitute ΔE into the factor equation:**\n    \n    Factor = exp[ -(h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n7.  **Perform the calculation:** Now, we can plug in the known values for the constants and variables to find the numerical answer. A Python script is suitable for this calculation to ensure precision.\n\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s\n        *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   **Variables:**\n        *   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   T_no_spots = 6000 K\n        *   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nThe code below implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the given parameters\n# Wavelength of the transition in meters\nlambda_transition = 1448e-10\n# Temperature of the star without spots in Kelvin\nT_no_spots = 6000\n# Temperature of the star with spots in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) for the transition\ndelta_E = h * c / lambda_transition\n\n# The ratio of populations is proportional to exp(-delta_E / (k*T))\n# We want to find the factor: Ratio_no_spots / Ratio_spots\n\n# This factor can be calculated as:\n# exp(-delta_E / (k * T_no_spots)) / exp(-delta_E / (k * T_spots))\n# which simplifies to:\n# exp[ (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\nexponent = (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots)\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nfactor=4.512684815259966\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation shows that the factor is approximately 4.51. This value matches option D.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the population ratio of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes. This factor is the ratio of `(N₂/N₁)_no_spots` to `(N₂/N₁)_spots`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Law:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere can be assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution of atoms among different energy levels in LTE is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    Where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of these levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Ratios for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1: No spots.** The effective temperature is T_no_spots = 6000 K.\n        Ratio_no_spots = (N₂ / N₁) at 6000 K = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_no_spots))\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: With spots.** The effective temperature is T_spots = 5500 K.\n        Ratio_spots = (N₂ / N₁) at 5500 K = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n    *Note:* The other information, such as the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage, is contextual and not required for this specific calculation, as the relevant initial and final temperatures are provided.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Desired Factor:** We need to find the ratio of the two ratios calculated above:\n\n    Factor = Ratio_no_spots / Ratio_spots\n\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_no_spots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n    The statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) is the same in both cases and cancels out:\n\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_no_spots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n    Using the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), we can simplify this to:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n5.  **Determine the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a photon of wavelength λ = 1448 Å. The energy of this photon is equal to the energy difference ΔE, given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n\n    Where:\n    *   h = Planck's constant\n    *   c = speed of light\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** Now we can substitute the expression for ΔE into our factor equation and plug in the numerical values.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare the ratio of atomic populations in two different energy levels under two different temperature conditions. The star's photosphere has a temperature of 6000 K when clear and an effective temperature of 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. We are asked for the factor by which the population ratio `N₂/N₁` changes between these two states.\n\n2.  **Select the Physical Model:** The problem specifies that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a crucial piece of information, as it allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of the energy levels.\n\n3.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The equation is:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher (2) and lower (1) energy levels.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the absolute temperature.\n\n4.  **Define the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario A (No Spots):** T_A = 6000 K.\n        Ratio_A = (N₂ / N₁)_[no spots] = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_A))\n    *   **Scenario B (With Spots):** T_B = 5500 K.\n        Ratio_B = (N₂ / N₁)_[with spots] = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_B))\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes from the \"with spots\" case to the \"no spots\" case. The problem statement says the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots, which means `Ratio_B` is smaller than `Ratio_A`. We are looking for the factor `Ratio_A / Ratio_B`.\n\n    Factor = Ratio_A / Ratio_B\n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_A)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_B)) ]\n\n    The term with the statistical weights, (g₂ / g₁), is a property of the atom and does not change with temperature, so it cancels out:\n\n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_A)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_B))\n\n    Using the exponent rule eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ, we get:\n\n    Factor = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_A - 1/T_B) ]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during the transition. We are given the wavelength (λ) of this transition as 1448 Å.\n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    where:\n    *   h = Planck's constant\n    *   c = speed of light\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** We can now substitute the expression for ΔE into our factor equation and insert the numerical values. To ensure accuracy, we will use a Python script for the calculation. The various pieces of extraneous information (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) are not needed for this specific calculation because the two relevant temperatures are given directly. The code output provided confirms the result of this calculation. The slight difference between different runs is due to using slightly different precision for the physical constants (h, c, k), but both results point to the same answer.\n\n    Using the constants that produced the provided output:\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k ≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   T_A = 6000 K\n    *   T_B = 5500 K\n    *   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    Let's re-verify the calculation.\n    `ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / 1448e-10 ≈ 1.372e-18 J`\n    `ΔE/k = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 99420 K`\n    `1/T_A - 1/T_B = 1/6000 - 1/5500 ≈ -1.515e-5 K⁻¹`\n    `Exponent = -99420 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ 1.506`\n    `Factor = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.508`\n\n    The result is approximately 4.5.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is ~4.5, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
