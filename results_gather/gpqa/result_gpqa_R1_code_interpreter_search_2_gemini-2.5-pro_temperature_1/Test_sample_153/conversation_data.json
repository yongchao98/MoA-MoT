    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl is ~75% abundant, ³⁷Cl is ~25% abundant).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton. It is a singlet because it does not couple with neighboring protons. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in this simple A₂B₂ or AA'BB' splitting pattern.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid. It fits the molecular weight and the carboxylic acid functional group. However, the four aromatic protons would be unique and would produce a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR or the very broad O-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acid chloride/ester. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the signals for a carboxylic acid in the IR and ¹H NMR.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule perfectly matches all the data.\n        *   **MW:** Its formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 156 g/mol, and with ³⁷Cl is 158 g/mol, matching the MS data.\n        *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring, which perfectly explains the two doublets (each for 2H) seen in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
