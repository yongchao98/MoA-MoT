    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. \"Observing a decay\" implies that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. If it decays at a distance shorter than the resolution, its track cannot be distinguished from the production point.\n\nLet the detector's resolution be $L$. We \"observe\" a decay if the decay length, $d$, is greater than $L$. We are given that this must happen for at least 30% of the particles.\n\n**2. Formulate the Physics**\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\geq d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\nWe want the fraction of observed decays to be at least 30%. This translates to the following condition on our resolution $L$:\n$P(\\text{distance} \\geq L) \\geq 0.30$\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution (which corresponds to the maximum allowed value for $L$), we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.3)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.3) = \\lambda \\times \\ln(1/0.3)$\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) and its relativistic motion.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The particle is relativistic. The Lorentz factor relates the total energy ($E$) in the lab frame to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n    $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n*   **Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$)**: Due to time dilation, the lifetime observed in the lab is longer than the proper lifetime.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n*   **Velocity ($v$)**: The velocity is related to the Lorentz factor by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying.\n    $\\lambda = v \\times \\tau = (\\beta c) \\times (\\gamma \\tau_0) = (\\beta\\gamma) c \\tau_0$\n    A useful identity is $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    So, $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n**4. Substitute Values and Compute**\nNow, we'll plug in the given values:\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s (we'll use a more precise value for calculation)\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\lambda$, then we calculate $L$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0_energy = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Calculate the required resolution, L\n# The condition is that P(decay_length > L) = 0.3\n# This gives L = -lambda_lab * ln(0.3)\nL = -lambda_lab * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{L}\")\n```\n2.267900135327318e-06\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated result is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options are different by several orders of magnitude.

    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let's break down the problem.\n\n**1. Condition for Observation**\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance, $d$, that is greater than the detector's resolution, $L$.
