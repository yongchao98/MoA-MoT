    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** `A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    *   **Clue 2:** `C + 2 D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    *   **Clue 3:** `C + H2O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Clue 4:** `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` (in a 1:1 ratio)\n    *   **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? (Options: C2, C2v, D∞h, D4h)\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Most Constraining Clue (Clue 3):**\n    The hydrolysis of C regenerates the starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The regeneration of A suggests that A is an element, likely a metal, that is resistant to water. The reaction is essentially the decomposition of the ligands of C, with A being released.\n    *   For C to produce two different acids upon hydrolysis, its ligands must contain the elements necessary to form these acids. This means the gas B, from which the ligands are derived, must contain at least two different non-metallic elements.\n    *   A common and fitting pair of acids is a strong hydrohalic acid (like HCl) and a weak acid (like HCN or H2CO3).\n        *   **Possibility (a):** F = HCl (strong), G = HCN (weak). This implies the ligands in C contain chlorine (Cl) and cyanide (CN) groups. This points to gas B being **cyanogen chloride (ClCN)**.\n        *   **Possibility (b):** F = HCl (strong), G = H2CO3 (weak). This implies the ligands contain chlorine (Cl) and carbonyl (CO) groups. This points to gas B being **phosgene (COCl2)**.\n        *   **Possibility (c):** F = HCl (strong), G = H3PO3 (weak). This implies ligands contain chlorine (Cl) and phosphorus (P). This points to gas B being **phosphorus trichloride (PCl3)**.\n\n3.  **Test These Possibilities with Other Clues:**\n\n    *   **Testing B = COCl2 (Phosgene):**\n        *   Hydrolysis works.\n        *   Clue 4: `D(g) + COCl2(g) -> H(solvent)`. It's hard to find a simple 1:1 reaction with another gas D to form a common solvent. This path is unlikely.\n\n    *   **Testing B = PCl3 (Phosphorus Trichloride):**\n        *   Hydrolysis can work (`HCl` and `H3PO3`). A clever part of this possibility is that H3PO3 is a reducing agent, which could explain how a metal ion from C is reduced back to the elemental metal A (e.g., Au³⁺ -> Au⁰).\n        *   Clue 4: `D(g) + PCl3(g) -> H(solvent)`. The reaction `O2 + 2PCl3 -> 2POCl3` produces phosphoryl chloride (H), a solvent. However, the stoichiometry is 1:2, not 1:1. This path has a flaw.\n\n    *   **Testing B = ClCN (Cyanogen Chloride):**\n        *   Hydrolysis can plausibly yield HCl (F) and HCN (G). For A to be reformed, the metal in C must be in an oxidation state that can disproportionate. Copper(I) is a good candidate: `2Cu⁺ -> Cu⁰(s) + Cu²⁺`. So, if A=Cu and C is a Cu(I) complex with chloro and cyano ligands, this clue works.\n        *   Let's assume this path is correct and proceed.\n            *   A = Cu (Copper, solid)\n            *   B = ClCN (Cyanogen chloride, gas)\n            *   C = A red Cu(I) complex formed from Cu and ClCN.\n            *   F = HCl (strong acid)\n            *   G = HCN (weak acid)\n\n4.  **Identify E and its Symmetry:**\n    *   We now look at Clue 2: `C + 2 D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   C is a copper(I) cyanide/chloride complex. Such compounds can be oxidized to produce cyanogen gas. A known reaction type is the oxidation of a metal cyanide. For example: `2CuCN + (oxidant) -> ... + (CN)2`.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **E is cyanogen gas, (CN)2**.\n    *   Cyanogen is a colorless gas, but it is extremely toxic (\"hazardous\").\n    *   The reaction would be the oxidation of the cyanide ligand in C. What is the oxidant D? A common gaseous oxidant is Cl2. Let's assume **D = Cl2**.\n    *   The reaction becomes: `C(Cu-CN-Cl complex) + 2 Cl2 -> (CN)2`. The stoichiometry is problematic (the problem states `C + 2D`), but the chemical transformation is plausible.\n\n5.  **Check the Final Clue (Clue 4):**\n    *   `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)`\n    *   With D=Cl2 and B=ClCN, the reaction is `Cl2 + ClCN -> H(solvent)`. This reaction is not common for producing a standard solvent. This is the main weakness of this hypothesis, suggesting the puzzle may be slightly flawed or rely on an obscure reaction. However, among the flawed pathways, this one remains one of the most chemically coherent.\n\n6.  **Determine the Symmetry of E:**\n    *   We have identified E as cyanogen, (CN)2.\n    *   The structure of cyanogen is `N≡C—C≡N`.\n    *   It is a linear molecule.\n    *   Let's determine its point group:\n        *   It has an infinite-fold rotation axis (C∞) along the molecular axis.\n        *   It has an infinite number of vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C∞ axis.\n        *   It has a center of inversion (i).\n        *   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C∞ axis.\n        *   It has an infinite number of C2 axes perpendicular to the C∞ axis.\n    *   A linear molecule with a center of inversion belongs to the **D∞h** point group.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the most plausible identity for the hazardous product E is cyanogen, (CN)2, which has D∞h symmetry. This matches option D. While the reaction scheme has some inconsistencies (notably the stoichiometry and the formation of solvent H), the chemical transformations required for the hydrolysis (Clue 3) and the identity of a hazardous product with a matching symmetry (Clue 2) are most coherently explained by this choice.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) C2 - Chiral, rare for simple hazardous molecules.\nB) C2v - Plausible for molecules like COCl2, SO2Cl2, XeO2F2. We explored these paths and they ran into significant contradictions.\nC) D∞h - Fits linear molecules with inversion, like (CN)2.\nD) D4h - Fits square planar molecules like XeF4. The XeF4 pathway failed the crucial hydrolysis clue.\n\nThe (CN)2 pathway provides the best, albeit imperfect, fit to the puzzle's constraints.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E, cyanogen ((CN)2), is D∞h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
