    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State and Operator:**\n    The electron's spin state is given by the vector `|ψ> = (3i, 4)`. We can write this as a column vector:\n    `|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n\n    The spin operator in the y-direction is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli-Y matrix:\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Normalize the Spin State:**\n    For calculations in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. A normalized state `|χ>` is obtained by dividing `|ψ>` by its norm. The squared norm is `<ψ|ψ>`.\n\n    First, find the bra vector `<ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector `|ψ>`:\n    `|ψ> = [3i, 4]^T`\n    `<ψ| = [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [-3i, 4]`\n\n    Now, calculate the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`:\n    `<ψ|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i^2) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n    The norm is `sqrt(<ψ|ψ>) = sqrt(25) = 5`.\n    The normalized state vector `|χ>` is:\n    `|χ> = (1/5) * |ψ> = (1/5) * [3i, 4]^T = [3i/5, 4/5]^T`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    The expectation value of `S_y` is given by the formula `<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ>`.\n    We can also use the unnormalized state and divide by the squared norm at the end: `<S_y> = (<ψ|S_y|ψ>) / (<ψ|ψ>)`. Let's use this second method as it can simplify the arithmetic.\n\n    First, calculate the numerator: `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = <ψ| (ħ/2)σ_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * <ψ|σ_y|ψ>`.\n\n    Let's compute `σ_y|ψ>`:\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) , (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T`\n    `σ_y|ψ> = [ -4i , 3i^2 ]^T = [ -4i, -3 ]^T`\n\n    Now, compute `<ψ|σ_y|ψ>`:\n    `<ψ|σ_y|ψ> = [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T`\n    `<ψ|σ_y|ψ> = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24`\n\n    So, the numerator is `<ψ|S_y|ψ> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we divide the numerator by the squared norm `<ψ|ψ>` which we found to be 25.\n    `<S_y> = (<ψ|S_y|ψ>) / (<ψ|ψ>) = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25`\n\n    The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    Comparing the result with the given options:\n    A) 12*hbar/25\n    B) -25*hbar/2\n    C) -12*hbar/25\n    D) 25*hbar/2\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector ket |psi>\npsi_ket = np.array([[3j], [4]])\n\n# Define the unnormalized state vector bra <psi|\npsi_bra = np.conj(psi_ket).T\n\n# Define the sigma_y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\n\n# Calculate the numerator <psi|sigma_y|psi>\n# Note: S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\n# We calculate the coefficient of hbar/2 first\nnumerator_coeff = psi_bra @ sigma_y @ psi_ket\nnumerator_coeff = numerator_coeff[0,0].real\n\n# Calculate the denominator <psi|psi>\ndenominator = (psi_bra @ psi_ket)[0,0].real\n\n# The expectation value is <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (<psi|sigma_y|psi> / <psi|psi>)\n# <S_y> = hbar * (1/2) * (numerator_coeff / denominator)\nfinal_coeff_hbar = 0.5 * numerator_coeff / denominator\n\n# Print the final coefficient of hbar\n# The result should be compared to the options, e.g., for option C, the coefficient is -12/25 = -0.48\nprint(f\"The coefficient of hbar in <S_y> is: {final_coeff_hbar}\")\nprint(f\"-12/25 is: {-12/25}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
