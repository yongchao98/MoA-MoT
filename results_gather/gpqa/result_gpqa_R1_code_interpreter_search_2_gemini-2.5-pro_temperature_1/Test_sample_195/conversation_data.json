    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, for a particle moving in a conservative potential field $U(x)$, the total energy is conserved. This total energy is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\nThe relativistic energy of a particle of rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nThe total conserved energy $E_{total}$ of the system is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nThis total energy remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n**2. Energy at Maximum Displacement (Amplitude)**\n\nAt the point of maximum displacement, the position is $x = A$. At this turning point, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is $v=0$.\n\nLet's calculate the total energy at this point:\n*   Position: $x = A$\n*   Speed: $v = 0$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0/c)^2}} = 1$\n*   Potential energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n*   Particle's energy: $E_{particle} = (1)mc^2 = mc^2$\n\nThe total energy is:\n$E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**3. Energy at Maximum Speed**\n\nThe maximum speed, $v_{max}$, is reached when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is at its minimum.\n*   Position: $x = 0$\n*   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$\n*   Potential energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n*   Particle's energy: $E_{particle} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nThe total energy at this point is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$\n\n**4. Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max**\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, we can equate the expressions for the total energy at the two points:\nEnergy at max speed = Energy at max displacement\n$\\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n2.  Invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n3.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - (\\frac{v_{max}}{c})^2 = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to solve for $(\\frac{v_{max}}{c})^2$:\n    $(\\frac{v_{max}}{c})^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n5.  Take the square root of both sides and multiply by $c$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}}{c} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n**Checking the Classical Limit:**\nIn the classical limit, the potential energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, i.e., $\\frac{kA^2}{2} \\ll mc^2$. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\nThe expression becomes $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - (1+\\epsilon)^{-2}}$.\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$.\n$v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)} = c\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$\nSubstituting $\\epsilon$ back:\n$v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)} = c\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\nThis is the correct classical result, confirming our relativistic formula.\n\n<<<B>>>"
