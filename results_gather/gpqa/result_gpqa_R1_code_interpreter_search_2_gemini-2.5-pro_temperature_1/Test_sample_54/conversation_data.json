    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons and Molecular Formula:**\n*   First, sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Next, let's determine the molecular formula and the number of protons for each possible compound:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate** (Cis or Trans): The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. The number of hydrogens is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the NMR data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate** (Cis or Trans): There are a few isomers, but a common one would be CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. The number of hydrogens is 10. This does **not** match the NMR data.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the proton count, we can confidently eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the NMR Signals to the Propenyl Acetate Structure:**\nThe structure is CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-CO-CH₃(d). Let's assign each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is a classic signal for the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-CO-CH₃). These protons (d) are isolated from other protons, so they appear as a singlet. The integration of 3H is correct.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached directly to the double bond (CH₃(c)-). These protons are split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), resulting in a doublet. The integration of 3H is correct.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a vinyl proton. Its high chemical shift (downfield) is because it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom (-CH(a)=). This deshielding effect moves the signal downfield. It appears as a doublet because it is only coupled to the other vinyl proton, H(b).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinyl proton (-CH(b)=). It is coupled to one adjacent vinyl proton, H(a), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet. It is also coupled to the three protons of the methyl group, H(c), which splits the signal further into a **q**uartet. This explains the \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) multiplicity.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\nThe key to distinguishing between the Cis and Trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n*   The signal for H(a) at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (³J) across a double bond is stereospecific:\n    *   **Trans** protons have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** protons have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nThe proton count eliminates the butenyl acetate options. The signal assignments match the propenyl acetate structure. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons confirms that they are in a trans relationship. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
