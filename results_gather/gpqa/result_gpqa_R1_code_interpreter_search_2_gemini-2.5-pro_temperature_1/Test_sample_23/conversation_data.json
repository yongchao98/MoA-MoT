    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be C_n H_m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), this is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    *   Solving for the ratio m/n:\n        `m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)`\n        `m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n        `0.8572m = 1.7136n`\n        `m/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n    *   Alternatively, 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). If the mass fraction of H is 1/7, then `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`, which gives `7m = 12n + m`, so `6m = 12n`, and `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is C_n H_2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_2n). Let's call the other liquid Y2.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both components are saturated or aromatic. Z is saturated. Y2 must also be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (a saturated cycloalkane) gives Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give Z (C_n H_2n).\n    *   For Y2 to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane C_n H_2n, it must be an unsaturated compound with the same carbon skeleton. The most plausible candidate for a non-bromine-decolorizing, hydrogenatable liquid is an aromatic compound. The corresponding aromatic compound would have the formula C_n H_(2n-6) (assuming a single benzene-type ring).\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y consists of {C_n H_2n (a cycloalkane), C_n H_(2n-6) (an aromatic hydrocarbon)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with a platinum catalyst, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n    *   Reaction: `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2` (in 1:1 molar ratio)\n    *   Substituting the formulas for Y: `X1 + X2 → C_n H_2n + C_n H_(2n-6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is hydrogenated, and the other is dehydrogenated. For the stoichiometry to be 1:1, the number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved between the reactant and product sides.\n    *   Let the formulas of the liquids in X be C_n H_a and C_n H_b.\n    *   Conservation of atoms implies: `C_n H_a + C_n H_b → C_n H_2n + C_n H_(2n-6)`\n    *   Summing the hydrogen atoms on both sides: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X is `a + b = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The liquids in X decolorize bromine water, so they contain C=C double bonds. They must be cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes, as they both hydrogenate to the cycloalkane Z (preserving the carbon ring structure).\n    *   The simplest way to construct this reaction is to have one molecule act as a hydrogen donor and the other as an acceptor. The most logical candidates are a cycloalkene (C_n H_(2n-2), having one double bond) and a cycloalkadiene (C_n H_(2n-4), having two double bonds).\n        *   Donor: `C_n H_(2n-4)` (cycloalkadiene) → `C_n H_(2n-6)` (aromatic) + 2H\n        *   Acceptor: `C_n H_(2n-2)` (cycloalkene) + 2H → `C_n H_2n` (cycloalkane)\n    *   The components of X are X1 = C_n H_(2n-2) and X2 = C_n H_(2n-4).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: `a + b = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This matches our earlier derivation.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   The problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine 'n'. However, we are given options. Let's test the most common and chemically significant small ring systems. Z is also described as a \"widely used solvent.\"\n    *   **Case n=6**:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}. Both are liquids.\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n        *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds\", so the diene must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n        *   This scenario is chemically sound and all components are common liquids.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is `10 + 8 = 18`. This corresponds to option A.\n    *   **Case n=7**:\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a common solvent.\n        *   Y = {Toluene (C7H8), Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)}.\n        *   X = {Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is `12 + 10 = 22`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both n=6 and n=7 provide chemically plausible scenarios that fit the problem description and correspond to given options.\n    *   However, the system involving benzene/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene/cyclohexane (n=6) is the most classic and fundamental example of this type of catalytic hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). In the context of typical chemistry problems, the simplest and most common example is usually the intended answer.\n    *   Let's assume the intended answer is for the C6 system.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are Cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in their molecular formulas: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nFinal calculation based on the most probable scenario (n=6):\n*   Liquid 1 in X: Cyclohexene, C6**H10**\n*   Liquid 2 in X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6**H8**\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
