    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4³⁻) in a solution containing KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. This solution constitutes a buffer system.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissolves in water to produce K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion). H₂PO₄⁻ acts as a weak acid in this context.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissolves to produce 2 Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 H₂O. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   We have a buffer solution composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of each component = 1.00 g.\n\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n        *   This gives 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n        *   This gives 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n    *   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\n    *   The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), for which the acid dissociation constant is Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   Assuming the initial concentrations are approximately equal to the equilibrium concentrations (a valid assumption for a buffer), we have:\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] = 8.114 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is governed by the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, with constant Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Using the values calculated above:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.114 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nFinal check using a python script for precision:\n```python\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99\n\n# Masses (g)\nm_KH2PO4 = 1.00\nm_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00\n\n# Volume (L)\nV = 0.200\n\n# Acid dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = m_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = m_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nC_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / V\nC_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / V\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (C_H2PO4_minus / C_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (C_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n```output\n6.24e-07\n```\nThe result from the calculation is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The provided Python code was executed successfully, and the output `6.24e-07` represents the calculated concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in Molarity (M).\n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n1.  **Calculate Moles:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n2.  **Calculate Concentrations:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The solution is a buffer governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻, Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸).\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ × ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) × (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M.\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** This is determined by the third dissociation (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²).\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) × (0.02809 / 8.11x10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.236x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.
