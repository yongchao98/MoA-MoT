    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 DBE) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a CH2 group). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting is caused by the single aldehyde proton. This further confirms the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). An amine is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group.\n    Attaching these to a benzene ring gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + NH2 + H (from CH2) + H (from CHO) = **C8H9NO**. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A):** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reagent mixture converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). This reaction is typically performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    The product (Intermediate B) is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming it up causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    The product (Intermediate C) is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen (from the CH2 group) of one molecule to form an enolate ion.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    3.  **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on C3 and the acidic α-hydrogen on C2 are eliminated. This is a dehydration step.\n        This dehydration is favorable because it forms a stable conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde).\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option C).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overall transformation is:\n4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → [diazonium salt] → 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde → 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all three steps, including the heating step. The heat drives the reaction to the dehydrated condensation product, which is more stable than the initial aldol addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
