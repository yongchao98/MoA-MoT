    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The Ca-EDTA complex is a stable coordination compound. However, it exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions in solution. The formation of the complex is described by the following reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up the Dissociation Equilibrium:** To find the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-10} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Use an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of all species. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no free $Ca^{2+}$ or $EDTA^{4-}$ is initially present. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :-------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |     0.02 - x    |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |        x        |\n\n    *(Note: The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which implies we can use the formal concentration of EDTA, $EDTA^{4-}$, without needing to account for its protonation states and the conditional formation constant.)*\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x:** Now, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n6.  **Apply an Approximation:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This means the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the equation by assuming $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Value of x:**\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    To solve for x, we can rewrite the exponent to be even:\n    $x^2 \\approx 40 \\times 10^{-14}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{40} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n8.  **Final Result:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    This value matches option A.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Dissociation constant\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_d = x^2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n# This can be rewritten as a quadratic equation: x^2 + K_d*x - K_d*initial_complex_conc = 0\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n# where a = 1, b = K_d, c = -K_d * initial_complex_conc\n\na = 1\nb = K_d\nc = -K_d * initial_complex_conc\n\n# Solve for x (concentration of Ca2+)\n# We take the positive root since concentration cannot be negative\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
