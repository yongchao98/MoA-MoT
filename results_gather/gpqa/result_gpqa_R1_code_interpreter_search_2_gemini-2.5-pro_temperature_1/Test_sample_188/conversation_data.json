    "*   **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) and Goldstone's Theorem:** This is a fundamental concept in physics. It occurs when the fundamental laws governing a system possess a certain symmetry, but the system's lowest-energy state (the ground state or vacuum) does not exhibit that same symmetry. Goldstone's theorem is a direct consequence of SSB. It states that for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a new particle must appear. These particles are massless (in the ideal case) or very light, and they are called Nambu-Goldstone bosons. They represent the low-energy excitations around the chosen ground state.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Options:** We need to check if each particle is a Nambu-Goldstone boson resulting from SSB.\n\n    *   **B) Magnon:** A magnon is a quantum of a spin wave. In a ferromagnet, the underlying physical laws are rotationally symmetric (no preferred direction for spin). However, in the ground state, all the atomic spins align in a single, specific direction, thus \"spontaneously breaking\" the rotational symmetry. The low-energy excitations from this aligned state are spin waves, and their quanta, the magnons, are the Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry.\n\n    *   **C) Phonon:** A phonon is a quantum of vibration in a crystal lattice. The laws of physics are symmetric under continuous translation in space. However, when atoms form a crystal, they arrange themselves in a fixed, periodic lattice. This ground state is not invariant under any arbitrary translation, only by discrete lattice vectors. Thus, the continuous translational symmetry is spontaneously broken. The Goldstone bosons corresponding to the three broken translational generators (x, y, z) are the three acoustic phonon modes.\n\n    *   **D) Pion (Pi meson):** In the theory of the strong nuclear force (Quantum Chromodynamics), for the light up and down quarks, there is an approximate symmetry called \"chiral symmetry.\" The vacuum state of QCD spontaneously breaks this chiral symmetry. According to Goldstone's theorem, this should produce three nearly massless Goldstone bosons. These particles are identified as the three pions (π⁺, π⁰, π⁻). Their relatively small mass (compared to other strongly interacting particles like the proton) is considered strong evidence for this picture. They are technically \"pseudo-Goldstone bosons\" because the initial chiral symmetry wasn't perfect to begin with (the quarks have a small mass).\n\n    *   **A) Skyrmion:** A Skyrmion is a different type of object. In the context of nuclear physics, it is a topological soliton. It is a stable, particle-like, non-linear excitation of the pion field. So, while it is a phenomenon that exists within a theory where symmetry is spontaneously broken (the theory of pions, which are themselves Goldstone bosons), the Skyrmion itself is *not* the Goldstone boson. It is a complex configuration *of* the Goldstone boson fields, used to model heavy particles like protons and neutrons. Its stability comes from a topological property (a \"winding number\"), not from Goldstone's theorem, and it is massive.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Magnons, phonons, and pions are all classic examples of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are the direct particle consequence of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. A skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson.\n\n<<<A>>>"
