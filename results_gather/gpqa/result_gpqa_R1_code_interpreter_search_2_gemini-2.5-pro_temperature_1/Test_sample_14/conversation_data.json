    "The user wants to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and by what factor.\n\n1.  **Identify the formula for transit probability:**\n    The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (`a`). For a circular orbit, this is:\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n2.  **Relate the semi-major axis (`a`) to known quantities:**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law for a planet orbiting a star, where the planet's mass (`M_p`) is negligible compared to the star's mass (`M_s`):\n    `P^2 ≈ (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * M_s)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 ≈ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    `a ≈ [ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n    Since `G` and `4 * π^2` are constants, we can express the proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n3.  **Express the transit probability in terms of the given parameters:**\n    Substitute the expression for `a` back into the probability formula:\n    `Prob ∝ R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n    `Prob ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n4.  **Define the ratio of probabilities:**\n    We want to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`Prob_1`) to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (`Prob_2`):\n    `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2`\n    `Ratio = [ R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P_1^(-2/3) ] / [ R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P_2^(-2/3) ]`\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values from the problem description:**\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` → `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n    *   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` → `M_s1 / M_s2 = 2`\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3` → `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio:**\n    `Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n    `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Compute the final value:**\n    To find the numerical value of the ratio, we calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    ratio = 4.5**(1/3)\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The result is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means that the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
