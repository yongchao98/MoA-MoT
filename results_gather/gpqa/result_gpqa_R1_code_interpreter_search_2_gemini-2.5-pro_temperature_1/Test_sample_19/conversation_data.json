    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is to treat a nucleon inside a nucleus as if it were a free particle during a high-energy interaction. Let's analyze each statement to see how it contributes to this idea.\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a fundamental part of the approximation. If the incoming probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) could interact with a pair of nucleons or a cluster of them simultaneously (these are known as meson-exchange currents or multi-nucleon currents), then the response would be a property of the nuclear medium, not of an individual nucleon. To treat the nucleon as \"free,\" the interaction must be localized to a single nucleon. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This addresses what happens *after* the initial interaction. If the struck nucleon, or the scattered probe, interacts with other nucleons on its way out of the nucleus, this is called a \"final-state interaction\" (FSI). These secondary interactions would modify the outgoing particle's energy and momentum, meaning its final state would not purely reflect the initial interaction. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" is equivalent to neglecting these final-state interactions, which is crucial for relating the observed outcome directly to the properties of a single \"free\" nucleon interaction. This assumption is essential.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement describes a model of the nucleon's internal structure. The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the *nucleon as a whole entity* within the nucleus. It doesn't inherently depend on the specific model of what's inside the nucleon. In fact, the impulse approximation is used in contexts like deep inelastic scattering where the quarks are treated as highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the essence of the \"impulse\" in the impulse approximation. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong force, which means it has binding energy and is not at rest. The approximation assumes that the interaction happens over an extremely short timescale. Over this brief \"impulse,\" the nucleon's interaction with the nuclear potential is negligible compared to its interaction with the high-energy probe. It is effectively \"frozen\" in its instantaneous state and acts like a free particle during the collision. This assumption is essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe three essential assumptions for the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   There are no secondary interactions with the rest of the nucleus (Statement 2).\n*   The binding forces are negligible during the short duration of the interaction (Statement 4).\n\nThe internal structure of the nucleon (Statement 3) is a separate modeling consideration. Therefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
