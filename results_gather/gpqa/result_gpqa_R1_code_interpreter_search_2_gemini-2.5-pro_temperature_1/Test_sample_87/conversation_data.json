    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Location of Response:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a key component of GALT and are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cells of Interest:** Proliferating cell population isolated from the Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response upon antigen encounter.\n    *   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene of these cells shows \"high variability\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options in the context of the key finding.**\n    *   The question centers on a process that generates \"high variability\" in the *variable heavy chain gene* of *proliferating lymphocytes* in a *secondary lymphoid organ* after an antigen challenge. This points towards processes involved in B cell affinity maturation.\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system's protein cascade. It helps clear pathogens but does not involve any genetic changes in lymphocytes. Therefore, it cannot be the cause of variability in the heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., switching from producing IgM to IgG or IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* affect the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The question specifically states variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a high rate specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process generates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors, leading to \"high variability.\" B cells with mutations that increase their affinity for the antigen are then positively selected. This process perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating cell population in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure.\n\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of antigen receptors in developing B and T cells. It occurs in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) *before* the cells encounter any antigen. The cells in the Peyer's patch are mature lymphocytes that are already responding to an antigen. V(D)J recombination has already been completed in these cells long before the experiment began.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the correct process.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
