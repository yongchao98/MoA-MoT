    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the problem into individual clues and analyze them one by one.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"** This immediately suggests we are dealing with isotopes, most commonly Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen) or possibly isotopes like ¹³C or ¹⁵N. Deuterium is a very common tracer and is used to make special reagents.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"** This is a very specific and helpful clue. Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. But Helium is inert and unlikely to be produced in a violent chemical reaction.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Yes. This is a very strong candidate, especially given Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible.\n        *   Let's consider molecules. D₂O (as steam): 10 protons (8 from O, 2 from D), 10 neutrons (8 from ¹⁶O, 2 from D). Yes.\n        *   Given the violent reaction, the production of a simple gas like D₂ from a deuterated reagent is chemically very plausible. Let's tentatively assume **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"a precipitate G forms...\"** The reaction produces a solid that is insoluble in the reaction medium.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"...which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   Let's convert the temperature: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This is close, but maybe not \"very close\".\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is *extremely* close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly suggests that **B = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"** A keto acid is a molecule with both a ketone functional group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the starting material has at least 3 oxygen atoms. The reaction with X causes a loss of one oxygen atom, which is characteristic of a reduction reaction (specifically, the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol).\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:** Now I will piece together the deductions.\n\n    *   If B is D₂O, it must be released from heating the precipitate G. This means G contains deuterium and oxygen. A common reaction is the thermal decomposition of a metal hydroxide, like 2M(OH)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3H₂O. So, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   The initial reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate G).\n    *   For the products to be D₂ and M(OD)ₓ, the reactants must have contained M and D. Since the reaction is violent, it is likely a reaction of a very reactive deuteride (Substance X) with a source of deuterium oxide (Liquid Y).\n    *   Therefore, **Liquid Y must be heavy water, D₂O.**\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   What could X be? It must be a powerful reducing agent to reduce D⁺ from D₂O to D₂ gas. It must also contain a metal (M) that forms an insoluble hydroxide/deuteroxide. Aluminum (Al) is a perfect candidate, as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry (fitting Clue 5).\n    *   Let's check the reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Let's check the final clue (Clue 6). A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) reacts with LiAlD₄. LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols: R-CO-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH). The starting material has 3 oxygens, and the final product (a diol) has 2 oxygens. This also fits perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   My deduction is solid: **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". We should use integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number Z=13).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium (¹H²) is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the two values.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
