    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of the acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (HCl), and the strong base (Ba(OH)2) before they are mixed. The formula for moles is Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of hydrochloric acid (HCl):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.08 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-), the moles of OH- are:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**Step 2: Neutralization of the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe strong acid (H+ from HCl) and the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2) will react first in a neutralization reaction:\nH+ + OH- → H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 mol\n\nThe H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of the remaining strong base with the weak acid.**\n\nThe remaining 0.10 mol of strong base (OH-) will now react with the weak acid (CH3COOH):\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available for reaction = 0.10 mol\n\nThe CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.05 mol of excess OH- from the strong base. The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess strong base. First, we need the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of OH-.\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the pOH and pH.**\n\nFirst, calculate the pOH from the hydroxide ion concentration.\n*   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n*   pOH = -log10(0.04167)\n*   pOH ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38\n*   pH = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
