    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can be interconverted by the migration of an atom or group, most commonly a proton. The most prevalent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with single bonds between carbons and three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH₂- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is sp³ hybridized and bears two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are part of carbon-carbon double bonds. These carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbons. Tautomerization is not possible under normal conditions. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar around the double bond. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry at the center of the C=C bond). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active. There are no chiral centers in this molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule. Therefore, **it will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
