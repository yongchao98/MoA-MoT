    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\nT_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\nThe problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2 = A). The star's properties (T_star and R_star) are also the same for both planets. Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) / (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) or sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits (a2 / a1).\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis:**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method provides information about the star's velocity wobble (K), which is caused by the orbiting planet. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to this velocity amplitude K:\n\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nwhere 'c' is the speed of light and 'λ_0' is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two planets is:\nK1 / K2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following relation (assuming the orbital inclination angle 'i' is ~90°, a valid assumption for transiting planets):\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nUsing the formula for 'a', we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Substitute the Known Values:**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nM_p1 = 7  # Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # Earth masses\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstrom\n\n# Calculate the ratio of planet masses\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1/delta_lambda_2)\nK_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# a is proportional to (M_p/K)^2\n# a2/a1 = ( (M_p2/K2) / (M_p1/K1) )^2 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio)**2 * (K_ratio)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio_1_over_2:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.5357\n<<<\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.53. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere:\n*   T_star = Star's effective temperature\n*   R_star = Star's radius\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   A = Planet's albedo\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2)] / [(R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nThe problem now simplifies to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), which is proportional to the star's velocity amplitude (K) caused by the orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star), the velocity amplitude is:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\nUsing the expression for 'a', we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) will cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2) ]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n**6. Substitute Values**\n*   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n    The velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ_0). Therefore, the ratio of amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the shifts.\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFinally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 6: Define the ratios from the problem statement\nmass_ratio_p2_over_p1 = 5 / 7\ndoppler_shift_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of velocity amplitudes K1/K2 is the same as the Doppler shift ratio\nvelocity_amplitude_ratio_k1_over_k2 = doppler_shift_ratio_1_over_2\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\nsemi_major_axis_ratio_a2_over_a1 = (mass_ratio_p2_over_p1)**2 * (velocity_amplitude_ratio_k1_over_k2)**2\n\n# Step 7: Calculate the final temperature ratio\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\ntemperature_ratio_t1_over_t2 = math.sqrt(semi_major_axis_ratio_a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(f\"{temperature_ratio_t1_over_t2:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.54\n<<<A>>>",
