  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is a carboxylic acid containing an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal, appearing as a broad singlet at a very downfield chemical shift, is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to at least two different types of protons.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, at a relatively downfield position for an alkyl proton, suggests a benzylic methine group (-CH-) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's piece together the fragments: `CH₃-CH₂-` and `CH₃-CH-`. The benzylic proton (2.9 ppm) is the CH, which is attached to the ring, the CH₃ (1.4 ppm), and the CH₂ (1.7 ppm). The CH₂ group is, in turn, attached to the final CH₃ group (0.9 ppm). This arrangement forms a **sec-butyl group**: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches the structure given in option (C).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI).\n    *   **Reagents Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to completely reduce carboxylic acids, ketones, and aldehydes to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group) will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Final Product:** The -COOH group is replaced by a -CH₃ group, yielding **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted product.\n    *   B) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** The alkyl group is incorrect.\n    *   C) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   D) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This structure is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
