    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understand the physical setup\n\n*   We have a point charge `q`.\n*   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on its surface. This results in a net attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere.\n*   The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`.\n\n### 2. Apply the Method of Images\n\nThis problem is solved elegantly using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges, can be perfectly replicated by a much simpler system:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n*   An \"image charge\" `q'` located *inside* the sphere.\n\nFor the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius R) to be zero, the image charge must have:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Position:** `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the same line as the charge `q`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.\n\n**Method 1: Calculating the work done**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is equal to the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d`. The work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n*   The force on charge `q` at a variable distance `x` from the center is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at a position `b = R^2/x`.\n*   The force is `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`.\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n*   `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n*   The work done `W` (which equals the potential energy `U`) is the integral of the external force (`-F_elec`) needed to move the charge from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F_elec(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [ (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx`\n*   To solve the integral, we use a u-substitution: Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫(from ∞ to d) (1/u^2) du`\n*   The integral of `1/u^2` is `-1/u`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n*   `U = [ -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ] - [ lim(x->∞) -k * q^2 * R / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]`\n*   The second term goes to zero as `x` goes to infinity.\n*   `U = - k * q^2 * R / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method 2: Using the general formula for electrostatic energy**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n*   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n*   `U = (1/2) * [ q * V_induced + ∫_sphere σ * V_sphere dS ]`\n*   Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0. The second term vanishes.\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   By the method of images, this `V_induced` is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q) = k * q' / (d - b)`\n*   Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k*q*R / (d * (d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k*q*R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur derived result matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
