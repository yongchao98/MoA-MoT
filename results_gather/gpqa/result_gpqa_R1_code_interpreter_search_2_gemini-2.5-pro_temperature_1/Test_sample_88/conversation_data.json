    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic alkane with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is not a standard elimination or substitution reaction. Elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead is forbidden by Bredt's Rule. A simple substitution to form 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane is inconsistent with the spectral data. The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically a ketone. This indicates that a rearrangement has occurred.\n*   The reaction of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes with strong bases at high temperatures is a known process that proceeds through a highly strained intermediate, 2,4-dehydroadamantane. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide, followed by rearrangement and/or oxidation steps, to yield **adamantan-2-one** (also known as adamantone).\n*   **Product 1 = Adamantan-2-one**.\n*   **Note on Spectral Data:** The provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) does not match the known spectrum of adamantan-2-one (which shows peaks around 2.6 ppm and 1.9 ppm). This is likely an error in the problem statement or data from non-standard conditions. We will proceed based on the known, well-established chemical reaction, as it is the only way to make sense of the subsequent steps.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Adamantan-2-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Aluminum isopropoxide is the classic reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. So, adamantan-2-one is first reduced to adamantan-2-ol.\n*   However, the next step in the sequence is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This is a crucial clue that **Product 2 must be an alkene**.\n*   Therefore, the reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ and heat is not just a simple reduction. It is a reduction followed by dehydration. While dehydration of adamantan-2-ol to form an alkene within the adamantane cage is difficult due to Bredt's rule, heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid catalyst (like the aluminum species present) can induce skeletal rearrangement followed by dehydration.\n*   The dehydration of adamantan-2-ol is known to proceed via rearrangement to form a more stable (less strained) alkene, which is **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n*   **Product 2 = Protoadamantene**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup (DMS). The ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond in protoadamantene and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n*   Cleavage of the double bond in protoadamantene breaks one of the rings in the tricyclic system, leading to a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound. The known product of this reaction is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n*   **Product 3 = Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione has a highly symmetric structure, preferring a dual-chair conformation. It has a C₂v point group.\n*   **Proton Environments:**\n    *   **Bridgehead protons (H-1, H-5):** These two protons are equivalent. They are adjacent to two carbons (C2 and C8/C6 and C4) which are alpha to carbonyls. This position is significantly deshielded.\n    *   **Alpha-protons (H-2, H-4, H-6, H-8):** There are 8 of these protons, existing as four equivalent CH₂ groups. Within each CH₂, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic but equivalent to the corresponding protons on the other CH₂ groups by symmetry.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons (H-9):** The two protons on the C9 bridge are diastereotopic (endo and exo).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this structure, the bridgehead protons (H-1 and H-5) are influenced by the anisotropic effect of two nearby carbonyl groups and are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons. Published data confirms this, with the chemical shift for these protons appearing furthest downfield (~2.9 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Pattern of the Bridgehead Proton (e.g., H-1):** We need to determine the splitting pattern of H-1.\n    *   H-1 is coupled to the protons on its adjacent carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   **Coupling to C2 and C8:** H-1 couples to four protons: H-2axial, H-2equatorial, H-8axial, and H-8equatorial.\n        *   Due to symmetry, H-2ax and H-8ax are equivalent to each other from H-1's perspective. Coupling to these two equivalent protons will produce a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3). The dihedral angle is ~180°, so this will be a large coupling constant (J_ax-ax).\n        *   Similarly, H-2eq and H-8eq are equivalent. Coupling to these two equivalent protons will also produce a **triplet**. The dihedral angle is ~60°, so this will be a small coupling constant (J_ax-eq).\n    *   **Combining the couplings:** The signal for H-1 will be split into a triplet by the axial protons, and each line of that triplet will be further split into another triplet by the equatorial protons. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n    *   **Coupling to C9:** There can be additional long-range W-coupling to the C9 protons, but this is typically small and may just broaden the peaks. The primary, most distinct pattern is the triplet of triplets from the vicinal couplings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most deshielded proton is the bridgehead proton (H-1 or H-5). Its signal is split into a triplet by two equivalent axial neighbors and further into a triplet by two equivalent equatorial neighbors. The coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
