    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame where the observer is at rest. In this frame, the glass is moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n    *   **The Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest. The S' frame moves with velocity `v` relative to the S frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S'):**\n    *   The definition of the index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n`.\n    *   The problem specifies that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   So, the speed of light in the S' frame is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction. We can assign a positive sign to this direction.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured in the laboratory frame (S), which we will call `u`.\n    *   We know the speed of the light beam in the S' frame (`u' = 1/n`) and the speed of the S' frame relative to the S frame (`v`).\n    *   The formula for relativistic velocity addition for motion in the same direction is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   Substituting `c = 1`, the formula becomes:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now, we substitute `u' = 1/n` into the velocity addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v )`\n    *   To simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n        *   Numerator: `n * ( (1/n) + v ) = 1 + n*v`\n        *   Denominator: `n * ( 1 + (v/n) ) = n + v`\n    *   So, the final expression for the speed of light in the laboratory frame is:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The derived speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
