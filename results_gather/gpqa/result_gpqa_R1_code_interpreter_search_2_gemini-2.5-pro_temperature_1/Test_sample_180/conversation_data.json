    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State and the Change:**\n    *   The Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n    *   The problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. The effect of this stoppage is observed on Earth now (as neutrinos travel from the Sun to Earth in about 8.3 minutes).\n    *   All other reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue as they were.\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    We need to know which reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands:\n    *   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n    *   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\n    Let's list the main neutrino sources and their energies:\n    *   **pp-I (p-p reaction):** Produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. **These do not contribute to either band.**\n    *   **pp-II (⁷Be electron capture):** Produces mono-energetic neutrinos. The primary line is at **861 keV (0.861 MeV)**, with a much smaller line at 384 keV. The 861 keV line falls directly into **Band 2**.\n    *   **pp-III (⁸B decay):** Produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV. These neutrinos would normally contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n    *   **CNO Cycle (¹³N and ¹⁵O decays):** Produce neutrinos with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These neutrinos contribute to both Band 1 and Band 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Impact of the Change:**\n    *   The pp-III branch is the source of the ⁸B neutrinos.\n    *   The problem states this branch stops. Therefore, the **flux of ⁸B neutrinos becomes zero.**\n\n4.  **Determine the Remaining Neutrino Sources in Each Band:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** With ⁸B neutrinos gone, the only remaining sources are the continuous spectra from the **CNO cycle neutrinos**.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** With ⁸B neutrinos gone, the remaining sources are the **CNO cycle neutrinos** AND, crucially, the very strong mono-energetic line from the **⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV**.\n\n5.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes:**\n    The question asks for the ratio: `Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`.\n    *   `Flux(Band 1)` = Flux from CNO neutrinos in a 100 keV window.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2)` = Flux from the ⁷Be line + Flux from CNO neutrinos in a 100 keV window.\n\n    To find the approximate ratio, we can compare the magnitudes of these sources using data from the Standard Solar Model (SSM).\n    *   **⁷Be Flux:** The total flux of the 861 keV line is very large, approximately **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. This is a line source, so this entire flux is concentrated at one energy, which falls within Band 2.\n    *   **CNO Flux:** The total flux from the main CNO reactions (¹³N and ¹⁵O) is about **5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. This flux is spread out over a wide continuous spectrum (up to ~1.7 MeV).\n\n    Now let's compare the two bands:\n    *   **Flux(Band 2):** It is dominated by the ⁷Be line. The contribution from the CNO continuous spectrum in this narrow 100 keV band is tiny compared to the 5 x 10⁹ flux from the ⁷Be line. So, we can approximate:\n        `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be) ≈ 5 x 10⁹`\n\n    *   **Flux(Band 1):** This comes only from the CNO spectrum. We need to estimate the fraction of the total CNO flux that falls into the 700-800 keV window. The CNO spectra have an effective width of about 1 MeV (or 1000 keV). A 100 keV window would contain, as a rough estimate, about 100/1000 = 1/10th of the total flux.\n        `Flux(Band 1) ≈ 0.1 * Total_Flux(CNO) ≈ 0.1 * (5 x 10⁸) = 5 x 10⁷`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    `Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`\n    `Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)`\n    `Ratio ≈ 10⁷ / 10⁹`\n    `Ratio ≈ 10⁻² = 0.01`\n\nThis result matches option D. The core of the argument is that Band 2 contains the massive flux from the ⁷Be line source, while Band 1 only contains a small slice of the much weaker, continuous CNO spectrum. The ratio of the total fluxes (CNO/⁷Be) is about 0.1, and since we are only taking a small slice (~10%) of the CNO flux for Band 1, the final ratio is approximately 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
