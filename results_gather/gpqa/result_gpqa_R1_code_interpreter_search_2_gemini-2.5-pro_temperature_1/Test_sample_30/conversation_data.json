    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the nitration of toluene. The combination of HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will primarily add to the positions ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) to the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The major product is typically the para-substituted isomer due to less steric hindrance compared to the ortho position. Therefore, Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n    Structure of Product 1:\n    A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group and a -NO₂ group in a para relationship (at positions 1 and 4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** MnO₂ in acidic solution is a strong oxidizing agent. It is capable of oxidizing an alkyl group attached to an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group. Therefore, Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzoic acid** (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n    Structure of Product 2:\n    A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -NO₂ group in a para relationship.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Initial Reaction:** The first thing that happens is a simple acid-base reaction. The acidic carboxylic acid (-COOH) reacts with the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, sodium p-nitrobenzoate, and water.\n*   **Main Reaction:** We are left with sodium p-nitrobenzoate, acetone, and excess NaOH. The problem asks for the structure of a specific product \"3\", and the options for its symmetry group (C_s, C_3, D_{2h}, C_{2h}) suggest a highly symmetric molecule.\n    *   Simple reactions like a Meisenheimer complex formation (attack of acetone enolate on the aromatic ring) would lead to a product with very low symmetry (likely C₁ or C_s), which doesn't fit the options well.\n    *   A less common but known reaction of nitroaromatics in the presence of a base and a reducing agent is **reductive coupling**. Acetone, in the presence of a strong base, can form an enolate which can act as a reducing agent, while it itself gets oxidized. This process can reduce the nitro groups of two molecules and couple them together.\n    *   The reduction of two nitro groups (R-NO₂) can lead to an azoxy (R-N=N(O)-R), azo (R-N=N-R), or hydrazo (R-NH-NH-R) linkage. The most common and stable product under these conditions is the azo compound.\n*   **Product 3:** Two molecules of p-nitrobenzoate undergo reductive coupling to form **trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid** (or its disodium salt in the basic solution). The trans isomer is significantly more stable than the cis isomer and would be the major product.\n\n    Structure of Product 3 (as the acid):\n    HOOC - [benzene ring] - N=N - [benzene ring] - COOH\n    The two benzoic acid moieties are linked by a trans-azo (-N=N-) group at their para positions.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid.\n*   **Shape:** For maximum stability and conjugation, the molecule is expected to be planar or nearly planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's identify the symmetry elements for this molecule, assuming a planar conformation. We can compare it to the similar molecule trans-stilbene, which is a classic example of C₂h symmetry.\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is a point at the exact center of the N=N double bond where if any atom is moved through this point to the other side, it finds an identical atom. The molecule is centrosymmetric.\n    3.  **Two-fold Rotation Axis (C₂):** There is a C₂ axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of inversion. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    4.  **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σ_h):** The plane of the molecule itself is a mirror plane. This plane is perpendicular to the C₂ axis.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule possessing the symmetry elements {E, C₂, i, σ_h} belongs to the **C₂h** point group.\n*   **Comparison with other options:**\n    *   C_s: Requires only a mirror plane. Our molecule is more symmetric.\n    *   C₃: Requires a 3-fold rotation axis, which is absent.\n    *   D₂h: Requires three perpendicular C₂ axes. As analyzed in the thought process, the molecule lacks the two C₂ axes lying within the molecular plane. Therefore, it is not D₂h.\n\nThe final product, trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid, has C₂h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
