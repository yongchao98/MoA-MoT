    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### **1. Determine the Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1. In this system, mass, energy, and momentum all have dimensions of mass, while length and time have dimensions of inverse mass.\n\nThe action, $S$, is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe action $S$ must be a dimensionless quantity (in units of $\\hbar$, which is 1).\nThe spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$. Since length has a mass dimension of -1, we have:\n$[d^4x] = (\\text{Mass})^{-4} = M^{-4}$\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension that cancels out the dimension of $d^4x$.\n$[S] = [\\mathcal{L}] [d^4x] = M^0$\n$[\\mathcal{L}] \\cdot M^{-4} = M^0$\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$\n\nAny term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$, must have this mass dimension.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = M^4$\n\n### **2. Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$, we first need to determine the mass dimensions of the fields $\\psi$ and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Fermion Field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion field (like an electron) in a Lagrangian is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. We look at the kinetic part, $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi$. This term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of 1, since $[x^\\mu] = M^{-1}$. So, $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The fields $\\psi$ and its Dirac adjoint $\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0$ have the same mass dimension. Let's call it $[\\psi]$.\n\n    So, for the kinetic term:\n    $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$\n    $[\\psi]^2 \\cdot M^1 = M^4$\n    $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$\n    $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$\n    $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu}, \\gamma_{\\nu}]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$\n\n### **3. Calculate the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can use the interaction Lagrangian to find the mass dimension of $\\kappa$.\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nWe know that $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = M^4$. So, we can write the dimensional equation:\n$[\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^0 \\cdot M^{3/2} \\cdot M^2 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{(3 + 2)} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **4. Determine if the Theory is Renormalizable**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed (as a first check, known as power-counting renormalizability) by examining the mass dimensions of its coupling constants.\n\nThe rule is as follows:\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a positive mass dimension ($[g] > 0$), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a zero mass dimension ($[g] = 0$), the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant $g$ has a negative mass dimension ($[g] < 0$), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and we found its mass dimension to be $[\\kappa] = M^{-1}$. Since the dimension is negative, the theory described by this interaction term is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nA non-renormalizable interaction implies that as we calculate higher-order corrections in perturbation theory (loop diagrams), we encounter new types of divergences at each order. To cancel these, an infinite number of counterterms would be needed, which strips the theory of its predictive power at arbitrarily high energies. Such theories are typically interpreted as low-energy effective field theories.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
