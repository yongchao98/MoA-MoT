    "This problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, let's identify all possible states of the system. Since there are three spins and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1), there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations for (S1, S2, S3).\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all these 8 states:\nZ = Σ_(S1,S2,S3)∈{±1}³ exp(-β * (-J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]))\nZ = Σ_(S1,S2,S3)∈{±1}³ exp(Jβ[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3])\n\nTo calculate this sum, we can evaluate the energy for each of the 8 configurations, determine the energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with the same energy).\n\nLet's list all 8 states and calculate the term X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 for each. The energy will then be E = -JX.\n\n1.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):**\n    X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -3J\n\n2.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):**\n    X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J(-1) = J\n\n3.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):**\n    X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n4.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):**\n    X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n5.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):**\n    X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n6.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1):**\n    X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n7.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):**\n    X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = J\n\n8.  **(S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):**\n    X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -3J\n\nNow, let's group the states by their energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where all spins are aligned: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) for this level is g1 = 2.\n    The contribution to the partition function is g1 * exp(-βE1) = 2 * exp(-β(-3J)) = 2 * exp(3Jβ).\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to all other states, where two spins are aligned with each other and one is anti-aligned. These are states (2) through (7) in our list.\n    The degeneracy for this level is g2 = 6.\n    The contribution to the partition function is g2 * exp(-βE2) = 6 * exp(-β(J)) = 6 * exp(-Jβ).\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of the contributions from all energy levels:\nZ = g1 * exp(-βE1) + g2 * exp(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
