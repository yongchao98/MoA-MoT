    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n    1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** I will analyze the information from each characterization technique to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n    2.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n        *   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding. An alcohol O-H stretch is also in this region (3200-3600 cm⁻¹) but is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n        *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    3.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which was suggested by the FTIR data.\n\n    4.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. I need to identify a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n            *   Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n                *   Mass = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n                *   Mass = 12.01 + 2 * 16.00 + 1.01 ≈ 45\n            *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is the characteristic base peak for many carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]+ fragment. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n    5.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n        *   From FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec, I have strong evidence for two functional groups:\n            1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n            2.  An alkene (C=C)\n\n    6.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas using Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        *   The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n        *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n        *   My deduced structure must contain one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the correct molecule must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    7.  **Calculate DoU for each option:** I will use a python script for accuracy and efficiency.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n        atoms = {element: int(count) if count else 1 for element, count in parts}\n        C = atoms.get('C', 0)\n        H = atoms.get('H', 0)\n        \n        # DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return int(dou)\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Degrees of Unsaturation:\")\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DoU = {dou}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"The structure must contain a carboxylic acid (1 C=O) and an alkene (1 C=C).\")\n    print(\"This requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"The formula must also contain 2 oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\")\n\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    Degrees of Unsaturation:\n    Option A) C6H12O: DoU = 1\n    Option B) C6H10O: DoU = 2\n    Option C) C6H12O2: DoU = 1\n    Option D) C6H10O2: DoU = 2\n\n    Analysis:\n    The structure must contain a carboxylic acid (1 C=O) and an alkene (1 C=C).\n    This requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n    The formula must also contain 2 oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    </execute_output>\n\n    8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n        *   **Option A (C6H12O):** DoU = 1, only 1 oxygen. Incorrect.\n        *   **Option B (C6H10O):** DoU = 2, but only 1 oxygen. Cannot be a carboxylic acid. Incorrect.\n        *   **Option C (C6H12O2):** DoU = 1. Cannot have both a C=O and a C=C. Incorrect.\n        *   **Option D (C6H10O2):** DoU = 2 and has 2 oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one carboxylic acid group and one alkene group. All the spectroscopic evidence supports this formula.\n\n    Therefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
