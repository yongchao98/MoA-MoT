    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy group) at position 1. This is a strong activating group and an *ortho, para* director.\n    *   -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at position 2. This is a weak activating group and an *ortho, para* director.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro group) at position 3. This is a strong deactivating group and a *meta* director.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3, which is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   Relative positions:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires careful control of directing effects, possibly using blocking groups or functional group interconversions. The presence of reagents like `NaNO2/HCl` in the options strongly suggests that a diazotization reaction of an amine is involved. The amine (-NH2) is often derived from the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2). The final ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically formed by Williamson ether synthesis from a phenol (-OH).\n\n**3. Analyze the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on standard principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n    *   Step iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. This reaction does not work as intended. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+AlCl3-). This complex is strongly deactivating and a *meta* director, leading to the wrong product isomer and low yields. Thus, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   This sequence contains several inconsistencies. For example, step (viii) is a reduction (Fe/HCl), but the likely intermediate before this step (based on the preceding reagents like `NaOH/EtBr`) would be an ether, which has no nitro group to be reduced at this stage. Also, having a reduction followed immediately by a nitration is unusual. The sequence of reagents is not logical. Thus, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts to use sulfonation as a blocking strategy.\n    *   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks the *para* position).\n    *   iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This correctly establishes an *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group.\n    *   iv) Reduction -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization -> [2-sulfo-4-tert-butyl-phenyldiazonium salt].\n    *   vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`. This step is problematic. Applying nitrating acid to a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic transformation. This step makes the entire sequence chemically invalid as written. Thus, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   Let's trace this path carefully. This sequence is long but follows a logical progression of functional group transformations.\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the bulky t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines is problematic (oxidation). The standard procedure involves protecting the amine as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3), performing the nitration, and then deprotecting. Assuming this is done, the strong *ortho, para*-directing acetamido group will direct the nitro group to its *ortho* position (position 2). This yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group to form the **[4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium] salt**.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **viii) SO3/H2SO4** and **ix) dilute H2SO4**: This is a sulfonation followed by a desulfonation.\n\n    **Evaluation of Option B:** The sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is a chemically sound and high-yield synthesis for the specific isomer **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is not the target molecule named in the question. However, Options A, C, and D contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a valid synthesis. The final two steps (viii, ix) are often used to isomerize a compound to its most thermodynamically stable form. While it is highly unlikely that this process would convert the 1,2,4-isomer into the more sterically hindered 1,2,3-target isomer, Option B is the only one that is not outright incorrect from a chemical reaction standpoint. Given the likely flaws in the question (either the target name or the options), Option B represents the \"best\" and most chemically plausible synthetic route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
