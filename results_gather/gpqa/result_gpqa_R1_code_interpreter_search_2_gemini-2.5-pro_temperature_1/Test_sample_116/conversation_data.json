    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial, planar, or helical chirality**, which arises from the overall shape of the molecule, even without a specific chiral atom. A common example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At positions 2 and 2': methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3)\n    *   At positions 6 and 6': nitro groups (-NO2)\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large and bulky. This bulkiness creates significant steric hindrance, which restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. Because rotation is hindered, the two rings are forced to be non-coplanar. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion (the midpoint of the C=C double bond). A molecule with a center of inversion is **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: This molecule shows geometrical isomerism; its *cis* isomer is dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
