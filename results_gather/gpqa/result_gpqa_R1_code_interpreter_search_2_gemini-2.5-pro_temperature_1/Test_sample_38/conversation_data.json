    "This problem requires the application of the normalization condition in quantum mechanics. The wave function of a particle, ψ(x), describes its quantum state. The probability of finding the particle in a specific region of space is determined by the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\n1.  **The Wave Function:**\n    The given wave function is a complex function:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n    This can be separated into its real and imaginary parts:\n    Real part: Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    Imaginary part: Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\n2.  **Probability Density:**\n    The probability density function, P(x), is the square of the modulus of the wave function:\n    P(x) = |ψ(x)|² = (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))²\n    P(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n    P(x) = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **The Normalization Condition:**\n    We are told that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means that the total probability of finding a particle in this interval must be 1 (or 100%). This is known as the normalization condition. Mathematically, it is expressed as an integral of the probability density over the allowed region:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] P(x) dx = 1\n    Substituting our expression for P(x):\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n4.  **Solving the Integral:**\n    We need to solve this definite integral. We can split it into two parts:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n    a² * ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx + 0.25 * ∫[from 1 to 3] 1 dx = 1\n\n    The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), and the antiderivative of 1 is x. Now we evaluate the definite integrals:\n    a² * [ln(1 + x)]<from 1 to 3> + 0.25 * [x]<from 1 to 3> = 1\n    a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) + 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 1\n    a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.25 * (2) = 1\n\n5.  **Solving for 'a':**\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    a² * (ln(4/2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    To find the numerical value of 'a', we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a squared\n# a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate a by taking the square root\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\nThe execution of the code yields:\n```\n0.8493231433360627\n```\nThis value, approximately 0.85, corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
