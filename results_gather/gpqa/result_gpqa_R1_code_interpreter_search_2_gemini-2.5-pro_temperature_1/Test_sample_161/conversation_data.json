    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Metric and the Area Element**\n\nThe problem provides a metric, which describes the infinitesimal distance $ds$ between two nearby points on a surface. The metric is given in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a metric of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$. By comparing the general form with the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on the surface is calculated using the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nLet's compute the determinant of $g$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we can find the area element:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\nNote that for the domain we are considering, $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$, so we can drop the absolute value.\n\n**2. Define the Region of Integration**\n\nThe problem asks for the area of the \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". The metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, which occurs at $x^2+y^2 = 4$. This is a circle of radius 2. This suggests that the surface is defined for coordinates $(x,y)$ inside this circle. Thus, the domain of integration is the open disk $D$ defined by $x^2+y^2 < 4$.\n\n**3. Set Up the Area Integral**\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the entire domain $D$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it's convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = r\\cos\\theta$\n$y = r\\sin\\theta$\n\nThen $x^2+y^2 = r^2$. The differential area element in Cartesian coordinates $dx\\,dy$ is replaced by $r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$ in polar coordinates. The domain $D$ ($x^2+y^2 < 4$) is described in polar coordinates by $0 \\le r < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral, we get:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nWe can separate the integral into two parts, one for $\\theta$ and one for $r$:\n$A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr\\right)$\n\nThe integral over $\\theta$ is simple:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nThe integral over $r$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ goes to infinity as $r$ approaches 2. We evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_r = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r\\,dr$, which means $r\\,dr = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nThe antiderivative is:\n$\\int \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\int \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int \\frac{1}{u} du = -16 \\ln|u| = -16 \\ln(4-r^2)$\n(Since $r<2$, $4-r^2>0$, so the absolute value is not needed).\n\nNow we evaluate the definite integral using the limit:\n$I_r = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left[ -16 \\ln(4-r^2) \\right]_{0}^{R}$\n$I_r = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-R^2) - (-16 \\ln(4-0^2)) \\right)$\n$I_r = \\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-R^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\nAs $R \\to 2^-$, the term $4-R^2 \\to 0^+$. The natural logarithm function $\\ln(x)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$.\nSo, $\\lim_{R \\to 2^-} \\ln(4-R^2) = -\\infty$.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is:\n$I_r = -16(-\\infty) + 16 \\ln(4) = +\\infty$\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince the integral with respect to $r$ diverges to infinity, the total area $A$ is:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the given pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<D>>>"
