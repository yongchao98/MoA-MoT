    "This problem is about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt, which we can take as the given lifetime τ) is on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n    The formula is: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2.\n    For an order-of-magnitude estimate, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n2.  **Energy Width:** This uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is also known as the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the quantum state. It means the energy level is not infinitely sharp but has a certain \"blurriness.\"\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s).\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For the first state:**\n        τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For the second state:**\n        τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The resolution is limited by the broader of the two states, which is the one with the shorter lifetime.\n    In this case, ΔE₁ (≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) is the larger energy width. Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| >> ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is smaller.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger (about 1500 times larger).\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller.\n\n    Only option C provides an energy difference large enough for the two energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_evs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state\n# using the approximation from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Delta_E ~ hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_evs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_evs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Delta E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Delta E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the levels must be\n# significantly greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\nlarger_width = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\nprint(f\"The larger energy width is: {larger_width:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nThe energy difference must be significantly greater than this value.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    comparison = \"sufficient\" if value > larger_width else \"insufficient\"\n    print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is {comparison} for resolution.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To clearly distinguish or resolve two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than the natural energy width (or uncertainty in energy, ΔE) of each level.\n\nThe relationship between the lifetime of a state (τ) and its energy width (ΔE) is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor an order-of-magnitude estimate, we can use the approximation:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy width for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy levels are \"blurry\" by the amounts ΔE₁ and ΔE₂.
