    "The user is asking to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels for a new boson, denoted as X, which has a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Interaction Lagrangian:**\n    The interaction between the boson X and the fermions is described by the Lagrangian term:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f $$\n    This Lagrangian can be split into two parts:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\n    *   The term $-\\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$ is the mass term for the fermion $f$, from which we can identify the fermion's mass as $m_f = \\lambda_f v$.\n    *   The term $-\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$ describes the interaction vertex between one boson X and a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This term allows the decay of the boson X into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion, i.e., $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Kinematic Constraints:**\n    For any decay process to be physically possible, it must be kinematically allowed. This means the mass of the decaying particle (the initial state) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products (the final state).\n    For the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n    $$ m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\n    Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n    $$ m_X \\ge 2m_f $$\n\n3.  **Use the Given Mass of the Boson X:**\n    We are given that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV.\n    Substituting this value into the kinematic condition, we get:\n    $$ 6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f $$\n    $$ m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\n    This inequality tells us that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$) as long as the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\n4.  **Check the Masses of All Fundamental Fermions:**\n    Now, we need to compare the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to this 3 GeV threshold. Let's list the approximate masses of the fermions.\n\n    **Quarks:**\n    *   **Up (u):** ~2.2 MeV = 0.0022 GeV  (0.0022 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed)\n    *   **Down (d):** ~4.7 MeV = 0.0047 GeV (0.0047 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed)\n    *   **Strange (s):** ~95 MeV = 0.095 GeV   (0.095 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed)\n    *   **Charm (c):** ~1.27 GeV             (1.27 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed)\n    *   **Bottom (b):** ~4.18 GeV            (4.18 > 3, so $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed)\n    *   **Top (t):** ~173 GeV                 (173 > 3, so $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed)\n\n    **Leptons:**\n    *   **Electron (e):** ~0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV (0.000511 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed)\n    *   **Muon ($\\mu$):** ~105.7 MeV = 0.1057 GeV  (0.1057 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed)\n    *   **Tau ($\\tau$):** ~1.777 GeV                (1.777 < 3, so $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed)\n\n    **Neutrinos:** The masses of neutrinos are extremely small (less than 1 eV), so decays into neutrino-antineutrino pairs are also kinematically allowed. However, they are not listed in the options, so we focus on charged leptons and quarks.\n\n5.  **Compile the List of Allowed Decays:**\n    Based on the mass comparison, the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson X are:\n    *   $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n    *   $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n    *   $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n    *   $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n    *   $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$\n    *   $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n    *   $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    *   A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$)\n    *   B) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and excludes $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$)\n    *   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (**Correct**, this list matches our derived list of allowed decays)\n    *   D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and excludes $c\\bar{c}$)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
