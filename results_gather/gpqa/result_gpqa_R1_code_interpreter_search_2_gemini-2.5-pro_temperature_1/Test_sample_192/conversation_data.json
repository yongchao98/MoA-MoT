    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the variables and relationships:**\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax of the stars.\n    *   Let `r` be the distance to the stars.\n\n2.  **Translate the given information into mathematical terms:**\n    *   The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This describes how the number of stars is distributed as a function of parallax. In calculus terms, this means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   So, we have the proportionality: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Identify the goal:**\n    *   The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically \"per unit range of distance, r\". This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`. We need to find how `dN/dr` is proportional to `r`.\n\n4.  **Relate the quantities using the chain rule:**\n    *   We want to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule of calculus:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Find the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    *   Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `plx = 1/r` (where distance `r` is in parsecs and parallax `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n6.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   Using the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   Since we are interested in how the number of stars in a distance shell `dr` relates to the number in a parallax shell `d(plx)`, we are concerned with the magnitude of this relationship. So, we can take the absolute value: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n7.  **Substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation:**\n    *   We start with the chain rule: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    *   Substitute the proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the expression for `d(plx)/dr`:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * | -1/r² |`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) `\n\n8.  **Express the final relationship in terms of `r` only:**\n    *   Now, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁵/r²`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to the cube of the distance, `r³`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^4\nB) ~ r^5\nC) ~ r^2\nD) ~ r^3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
