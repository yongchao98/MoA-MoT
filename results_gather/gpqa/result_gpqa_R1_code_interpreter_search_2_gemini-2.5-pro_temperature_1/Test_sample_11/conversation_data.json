    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** We have a positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n        *   Initial energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_π * c²\n        *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0 (since it's stationary).\n    *   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ). Both particles are moving.\n        *   Final energy (E_final) = Total energy of muon + Total energy of neutrino = E_μ + E_ν\n        *   Final momentum (p_final) = Momentum of muon + Momentum of neutrino = p_μ + p_ν\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        *   p_initial = p_final\n        *   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n        *   This implies p_μ = -p_ν. The particles move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p', so |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        *   E_initial = E_final\n        *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The total energy E of a particle is related to its momentum p and rest mass m by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)².\n    *   **For the muon (μ⁺):** E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   **For the neutrino (ν_μ):** Neutrinos have a very small mass and are often treated as massless in such problems. Let's assume m_ν = 0.\n        *   E_ν² = (p*c)² + (0 * c²)² => E_ν = p*c\n        *   For a massless particle, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy. So, KE_ν = E_ν = p*c.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    *   From energy conservation: m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Substitute E_ν = pc: m_π * c² = E_μ + pc => E_μ = m_π * c² - pc\n    *   Now substitute this expression for E_μ into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n        *   (m_π * c² - pc)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        *   (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms on both sides cancel out:\n        *   (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(pc) = (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Rearrange to solve for pc (which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν):\n        *   (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² = 2(m_π * c²)(pc)\n        *   pc = [ (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π * c² ]\n        *   KE_ν = pc\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    *   The total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the decay) is the difference in rest masses:\n        *   Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c²\n    *   Therefore, KE_μ = (m_π * c² - m_μ * c²) - KE_ν\n\n6.  **Computation:**\n    *   We can now plug in the given values:\n        *   m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n        *   m_μ * c² = 105.7 MeV\n    *   Let's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula.\n# KE_nu = [ (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi_c2 ]\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energies.\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the total kinetic energy minus the neutrino's kinetic energy.\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results. The options have varying decimal places, so let's calculate with high precision and then compare.\n# Let's format them to match option D.\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of the muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic energy of the muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of the neutrino (nu): 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle into two other particles. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, using relativistic formulas.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the decay process:**\n    *   A stationary positive pion (π⁺) decays into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n    *   The reaction is: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n2.  **State the conservation laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        *   p_initial = 0\n        *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n        *   Therefore, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀c² is the rest mass energy.\n        *   E_initial = E_π = m_πc² (since the pion is at rest, its kinetic energy is zero)\n        *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n        *   Therefore, m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Set up the equations:**\n    *   We have the following information:\n        *   Rest energy of pion (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n        *   Rest energy of muon (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n        *   Neutrinos (ν) are considered to be massless in this context (m_νc² ≈ 0).\n\n    *   Using the energy-momentum relation for the final particles:\n        *   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n        *   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν² = (pc)² + (0)²  => E_ν = pc. For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown energies:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy equation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Substitute E_ν = pc: m_πc² = E_μ + pc\n    *   Rearrange to isolate E_μ: E_μ = m_πc² - pc\n    *   Now, square both sides: E_μ² = (m_πc² - pc)²\n    *   We have two expressions for E_μ². Let's equate them:\n        *   (pc)² + (m_μc²)² = (m_πc² - pc)²\n    *   Expand the right side:\n        *   (pc)² + (m_μc²)² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)²\n    *   The (pc)² term on both sides cancels out:\n        *   (m_μc²)² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for pc (which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν):\n        *   2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\n        *   pc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical values:**\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n        *   KE_ν = pc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n        *   KE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n        *   KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n        *   The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest masses:\n        *   Total KE = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_πc² - m_μc²\n        *   Total KE = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n        *   Now, we can find KE_μ:\n        *   KE_μ = Total KE - KE_ν\n        *   KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n        *   A more precise calculation using the unrounded value for KE_ν gives: KE_μ = 33.9 - 29.78... ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) is approximately 4.12 MeV.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n    *   These values match option D.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<D>>>"
