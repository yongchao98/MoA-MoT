    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2 group). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aryl ester (a C=O group attached to a benzene ring), which are often found around 1715-1730 cm-1. It is too high for a typical amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH2CH3) or an ether. Given the IR data, an ethyl ester is the most likely conclusion.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal. The chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline-type amine (an amine attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting the adjacent protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting the adjacent protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  The amine group is electron-donating, and the ester group is electron-withdrawing. This perfectly explains the aromatic proton shifts: the protons next to the donating -NH2 group are at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm), and the protons next to the withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm).\n    4.  The structure is therefore 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, or **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). The NMR quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. Also, the substitution is meta (1,3), which would not produce two simple doublets in the NMR.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DoU, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>"
