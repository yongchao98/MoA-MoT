    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring containing an ester functional group (a delta-lactone). It has an oxygen atom at position 1 and a carbonyl group at position 2. The ring is saturated (\"tetrahydro\").\n*   **Substitution:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 4.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 4 is a chiral center. The product of reaction 1 is the (R)-enantiomer, and the product of reaction 2 is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n  C(2)---O(1)\n /       \\\nC(3)H2   C(6)H2\n|         |\nC(4)H----C(5)H2\n|\nCH2CH3\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Structure:** This is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid). It has a free carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu) at the other end (C5). An ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **Chirality:** Carbon 3 is the chiral center in the starting material.\n\nThe overall transformation involves converting this dicarboxylic acid monoester into a lactone. A lactone is formed from a hydroxy-acid. Specifically, the product is a delta-lactone, which forms from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\nThis means the starting material, `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, must be converted into the intermediate `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). This requires the selective reduction of the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) of the hydroxy-acid to form the final lactone product.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1: Reagent LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is strong enough to reduce the ester but generally does not react with the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** LiBH₄ correctly performs the required transformation: it reduces the ester group at C5 to an alcohol, leading to the hydroxy-acid intermediate and then the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical reaction (reduction) occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration** at the chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules change for the substituents on the chiral center.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (C3):**\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-iBu` (ester group has priority over acid group)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH`\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃`\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Priorities in Product (C4):** The chiral center C3 becomes C4. The groups transform as follows:\n        *   `-CH₂-COO-iBu` (Start Priority 1) → `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (Product Priority 2)\n        *   `-CH₂-COOH` (Start Priority 2) → `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (Product Priority 1)\n        *   `-CH₂CH₃` (Start Priority 3) → `-CH₂CH₃` (Product Priority 3)\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereodescriptor:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. Due to this change in CIP priorities, the R/S descriptor will flip even though the spatial arrangement of the groups is retained. An (S) starting material will yield an (R) product, and an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n\n*   **Final Deduction for A:** The product is the **(R)-lactone**. Since the reaction causes an S→R inversion of the name, the starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2: Reagent BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) typically reduces carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, in dicarboxylic acid monoesters like this one, a special mechanism called **anchimeric assistance** occurs. The BH₃ first reacts with the free carboxylic acid to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (`-COO-BH₂`). This borane group is then held close to the ester carbonyl, allowing it to deliver a hydride intramolecularly, reducing the ester. This intramolecular reaction is faster than the intermolecular reduction of a simple ester. Therefore, in this specific case, BH₃ also selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the same as with LiBH₄: the ester at C5 is reduced, leading to the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction mechanism does not involve the chiral center C3, so it also proceeds with **retention of configuration**. The same change in CIP priorities occurs as in Reaction 1. Therefore, an (R) starting material will yield an (S) product.\n\n*   **Final Deduction for B:** The product is the **(S)-lactone**. Since the reaction causes an R→S inversion of the name, the starting material **B** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
