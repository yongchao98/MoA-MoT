    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent performs acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A general rule in stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Detailed Path:**\n        1.  The epoxidation of the achiral (E)-alkene with the achiral mCPBA can occur from either face of the double bond with equal probability. This produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        2.  The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n        3.  When (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane is opened by water, the attack at C4 inverts its configuration to S, yielding (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 would yield (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are the same molecule.\n        4.  When (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane is opened, it also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        5.  The molecule (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a center of inversion (in its anti-periplanar conformation) and is therefore a *meso* compound. It is achiral.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A general rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Detailed Path:**\n        1.  Epoxidation of the (Z)-alkene is a *syn*-addition, which produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane, is a *meso* compound (it has a plane of symmetry).\n        2.  The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n        3.  Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts the configuration to S, yielding **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        4.  Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts the configuration to R, yielding **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        5.  These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the two enantiomers must be formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three compounds is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will interact differently with the stationary and mobile phases. Therefore, they can be separated. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each of the three stereoisomers.\n    *   It will separate the meso-diol from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   It will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three distinct peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
