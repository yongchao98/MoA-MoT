    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the basic relationships:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx) and Distance (d):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance to a star. For simplicity in calculations, we can write this relationship as `plx = 1/d`, which implies `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance:**\n    *   Consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume: `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to a parallax range:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is a density function. In mathematical terms, this is `dN/d(plx)`. We are interested in how this quantity depends on `plx`, so we can ignore the constant factors.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars `N` changes as the parallax `plx` changes. We can use the chain rule for differentiation: `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the components of the chain rule:**\n    *   **First component (dN/dd):** This represents the number of stars in an infinitesimally thin spherical shell at distance `d`. We can find it by differentiating our expression for `N` with respect to `d`:\n        `N = (4/3)πρd³`\n        `dN/dd = d/dd[(4/3)πρd³] = 4πρd²`\n    *   **Second component (dd/d(plx)):** This represents how the distance `d` changes as parallax `plx` changes. We differentiate our parallax-distance relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx)[plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n\n5.  **Combine the components:**\n    *   Now, multiply the two components together:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx)) = (4πρd²) * (-1/plx²) `\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax increases, the number of stars in the corresponding volume decreases (since higher parallax means smaller distance). Since we are interested in the magnitude or density, we can take the absolute value.\n\n6.  **Express the final result in terms of parallax (plx) only:**\n    *   Our expression `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρd²/plx²` still contains `d`. We need to substitute `d = 1/plx` into it.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * (1/plx)² / plx²`\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * (1/plx²) / plx²`\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. The term `4πρ` is a constant based on our assumption of uniform density.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship is `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
