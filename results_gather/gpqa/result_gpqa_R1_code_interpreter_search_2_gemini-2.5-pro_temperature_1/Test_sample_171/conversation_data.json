    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy level `i` (`N_i`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level `j` (`N_j`) is given by:\n\n`N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (`E_i - E_j`).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately `1.3806 x 10^(-23) J/K`).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Applying to the Two Stars**\n\nWe are comparing the same transition (the same two energy levels of iron) in two different stars, star_1 and star_2.\n\n*   For star_1 (temperature `T_1`):\n    `(N_i / N_j)_1 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n*   For star_2 (temperature `T_2`):\n    `(N_i / N_j)_2 = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nThe term `(g_i / g_j)` is a property of the specific atomic transition and is the same for both stars.\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state in star_1 is twice the same ratio in star_2.\n\n`(N_i / N_j)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_j)_2`\n\n**4. Setting up the Equation**\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n`(g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_i / g_j) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_i / g_j)` cancels out from both sides:\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**5. Solving for the Temperatures**\n\nTo solve for the relationship between `T_1` and `T_2`, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n\n`exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ) = 2`\n`exp( ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) ) = 2`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n`exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ) = 2`\n\nTake the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n`(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n**6. Substituting the Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides:\n*   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n*   The Boltzmann constant is a fundamental physical constant, `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\nLet's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\nThe problem is constructed such that the pre-factor `ΔE / k` is equal to 1. Substituting this value into our derived equation:\n\n`1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
