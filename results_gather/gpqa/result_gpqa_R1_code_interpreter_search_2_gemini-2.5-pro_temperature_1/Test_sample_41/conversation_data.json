    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n    T_eq = [L(1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   d is the orbital distance from the star.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, L is constant. The problem states that the albedo A is the same for all three planets. The terms 16, π, and σ are physical constants. Therefore, all terms except d are constant for the planets in this system. This simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/d^2)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ 1/d^(1/2) or T_eq ∝ 1/√d\n\n    We can rearrange this to express the orbital distance (d) in terms of the equilibrium temperature (T_eq):\n    d ∝ 1/T_eq^2\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital distance (d). The law states:\n    P^2 ∝ a^3\n    For our case with circular orbits:\n    P^2 ∝ d^3\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    P ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n    Note: The information about planet masses and the TTV method is extra information not needed for this calculation, as the planet's mass is typically negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law approximation (P² ≈ (4π²/GM_star) * d³).\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships to Find the Period-Temperature Relation:**\n    Now we can combine the two proportionalities to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n    We have P ∝ d^(3/2) and d ∝ 1/T_eq^2.\n    Substitute the expression for d into the expression for P:\n    P ∝ (1/T_eq^2)^(3/2)\n    P ∝ 1/T_eq^3\n\n    This means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Ratios:**\n    We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1.\n    Using the relationship P ∝ 1/T_eq^3, we can write the ratio as:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n\n    We are given the following temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    We can find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying the two given ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n    Now, substitute this value back into the period ratio equation:\n    P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    To get the final answer, we compute the cube of 3.22.\n    P3 / P1 = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 = 10.3684 * 3.22 = 33.386248\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios from the problem description\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# The relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq)\n# is derived from the laws of thermal equilibrium and Kepler's Third Law.\n# Equilibrium Temperature: T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)  => d ∝ 1 / T_eq^2\n# Kepler's Third Law: P ∝ d^(3/2)\n# Combining these gives: P ∝ (1 / T_eq^2)^(3/2) => P ∝ 1 / T_eq^3\n# Therefore, the ratio of periods P3/P1 is related to the inverse cube of the ratio of temperatures T3/T1.\n# P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n\n# First, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3.\nT_eq1_over_T_eq3 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2 * T_eq2_over_T_eq3\n\n# Now, calculate the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 to Planet1.\nP3_over_P1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq3 ** 3\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(P3_over_P1)\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (d) from its star by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)\n\nThis means that the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\nd ∝ 1 / T_eq^2\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period (P) of a planet is related to its orbital distance by:\nP^2 ∝ d^3\nor\nP ∝ d^(3/2)\n\nBy combining these two relationships, we can find the relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature:\nP ∝ (1 / T_eq^2)^(3/2)\nP ∝ 1 / T_eq^3\n\nThis shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 (P3) and Planet1 (P1) can be expressed as:\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n1.  T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n2.  T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\nWe can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet3 by multiplying these two ratios:\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP3 / P1 = (3.22)^3 ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planet masses and the specific albedo value is not required for this calculation, as we are dealing with ratios where these factors cancel out.\n\n<<<D>>>"
