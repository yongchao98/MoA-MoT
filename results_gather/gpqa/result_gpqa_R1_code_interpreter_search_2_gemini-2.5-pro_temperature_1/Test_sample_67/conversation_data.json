    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin can be either \"up\" or \"down\" along a given axis. \"Aligned\" means the spin is in the higher energy state that corresponds to the magnetic moment pointing along the field. However, the potential energy is `U = -μ ⋅ B`. To be aligned, `μ` and `B` should be parallel, which minimizes the energy. If `γ > 0`, `μ_z` and `S_z` have the same sign. So `μ` is parallel to `B` when `S_z` is positive. Therefore, the particle is in the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    In quantum mechanics, this state is represented by the eigenvector of the `S_z` operator with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. Let's denote this state as `|+z>`. So, the initial state at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new magnetic field is `B_vec = B j_hat` (where `j_hat` is the unit vector in the y-direction).\n    The interaction of a magnetic moment `μ` with a magnetic field `B_vec` is described by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec`.\n    The magnetic moment operator `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    So, `μ = γ(S_x i_hat + S_y j_hat + S_z k_hat)`.\n    The Hamiltonian for `t ≥ 0` is:\n    `H = - (γS) ⋅ (B j_hat) = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)`.\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The expression simplifies to:\n    `U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`.\n    We need to calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    Let's find the state `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n    To evaluate this, we can express the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the eigenstates of `S_y`. The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    In the z-basis:\n    `|+y> = (1/√2) (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n    `|-y> = (1/√2) (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    From these, we can write the initial state `|+z>` as:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`.\n\n    Now, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `S_y`, the action of `U(t)` is simple:\n    `U(t)|+y> = exp(iωt(+ħ/2)/ħ) |+y> = exp(iωt/2) |+y>`\n    `U(t)|-y> = exp(iωt(-ħ/2)/ħ) |-y> = exp(-iωt/2) |-y>`\n\n    So, the state at time `t` is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) * (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ U(t)|+y> + U(t)|-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iωt/2)|+y> + exp(-iωt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n    Now, we convert back to the z-basis to calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ exp(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (exp(iωt/2) + exp(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iωt/2) - exp(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\n    Now we can calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) S_z (cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Using `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, and the orthogonality of the states:\n    `<S_z(t)> = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n    The expression for `<μ_z(t)>` is a cosine function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(Ωt)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n    In our case, the argument of the cosine is `ωt`. Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\n    We defined `ω = γB`.\n\n    So, the oscillation frequency is `gamma * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field direction (`Y`-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis, `<S_z>`, oscillates as `cos(ωt)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency is `gamma * B`, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
