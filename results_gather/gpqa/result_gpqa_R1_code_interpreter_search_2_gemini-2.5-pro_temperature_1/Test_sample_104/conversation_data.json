    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would cause the same drop in brightness as a star's spotted hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Model the Star's Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted one.\n    *   The maximum brightness (`F_max`) occurs when the clean, unspotted hemisphere faces the observer.\n    *   The minimum brightness (`F_min`) occurs when the hemisphere with dark spots faces the observer.\n    *   The amplitude of this variation is given by the formula: `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Flux Equations:**\n    *   According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per unit area (flux) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T⁴).\n    *   Let's denote the flux from the unspotted part of the star as `Flux_star ∝ T_star⁴` and from the spots as `Flux_spot ∝ T_spot⁴`.\n    *   `F_max` corresponds to the entire visible disk radiating at `T_star`. So, `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n    *   `F_min` corresponds to the visible disk being a mix of normal photosphere and cooler spots. The filling factor `f` is 0.20, meaning 20% of the area is covered by spots and 80% is normal. So, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Amplitude from the Spots:**\n    *   Substitute the flux expressions into the amplitude formula:\n        `Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n    *   Simplify the numerator:\n        `T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴ = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n    *   The simplified formula for the amplitude becomes:\n        `Amplitude_spot = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴ = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n    *   Plug in the given values:\n        *   `f = 0.20`\n        *   `T_star = 6000 K`\n        *   `T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a fraction of the starlight.\n    *   The amplitude of the dimming (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n\n6.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the amplitude of the signal is the same for both scenarios.\n        `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n        `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n    *   Take the square root of both sides to find the relative radius:\n        `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴) ]`\n\n7.  **Perform the final calculation using a Python script.**\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_star = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin (6000K - 1000K)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.\n# Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# Step 2: The amplitude of a transit signal is (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We set the two amplitudes equal to each other.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spot\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star).\nrpl_rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {rpl_rstar}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nThe calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.3217917549486955\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated value for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** We need to find the relative radius of an exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would create a transit signal with the same amplitude as the brightness variation caused by a spotted star.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation due to Spots:**\n    *   The brightness (or flux, F) of the star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T_eff⁴), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   The maximum flux (`F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_star`. So, `F_max ∝ T_star⁴`.\n    *   The minimum flux (`F_min`) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) covered by spots at `T_spot` and the remaining fraction `(1 - f)` at the normal stellar temperature `T_star`.\n    *   So, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The amplitude of the variation is defined as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        `Amplitude_spot = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n    *   Simplifying the numerator:\n        `T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴ = f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)`\n    *   The amplitude expression becomes:\n        `Amplitude_spot = [f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_star⁴ = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴) = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The drop in brightness is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n4.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve for the Relative Radius:**\n    *   The problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude:\n        `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n        `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)`\n    *   To find the relative radius, we take the square root of both sides:\n        `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴) ]`\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   Filling factor, `f = 0.20`\n    *   Star temperature, `T_star = 6000 K`\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32. This corresponds to option D. The provided code execution confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
