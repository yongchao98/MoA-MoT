As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n**1. Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants:**\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This is a partial loss of resistance. It means G1 contributes to the plant's defense, but it's not the only gene involved.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of resistance. This indicates that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway. No matter what other genes are doing, without G2, there is no resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This is also a partial loss of resistance, more severe than the g1 mutant. G3 also contributes to the defense mechanism.\n\n**2. Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to understand gene interactions:**\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n*   **Epistasis:** When a double mutant exhibits the phenotype of one of the single mutants, it's called epistasis. The gene whose phenotype is expressed (in this case, `g2`) is said to be epistatic to the other gene (whose phenotype is masked). Since both `g1g2` and `g2g3` have the same 0% resistance phenotype as `g2`, we can conclude that **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**. In a genetic pathway, this typically means G2 acts downstream of G1 and G3, or it functions in a parallel pathway that is absolutely essential for the final outcome.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. Let's compare this to the single mutants:\n    *   `g1` resistance = 75% (25% loss from WT)\n    *   `g3` resistance = 50% (50% loss from WT)\n    *   If the effects were simply additive, we might expect a 75% loss (25% + 50%), resulting in 25% resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance is 10%, which means a 90% loss. This is much more severe than the sum of the individual effects. This phenomenon is called a **synergistic interaction**. It suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping functions. When both are knocked out, the resulting defect is much larger than expected. This is a hallmark of **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy).\n\n**3. Incorporate the information about the transcription factor (TF):**\n*   The problem states, \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).\"\n*   We've established that G2 is an essential gene, and its mutation is epistatic to the others. A common role for such a gene is a master-regulator, like a transcription factor that activates a whole suite of downstream resistance genes. If G2 is this TF, its knockout would shut down the entire main defense response, leading to 0% resistance, which fits the data perfectly.\n*   Could G1 or G3 be the TF? If, for example, G1 were a TF that activates G2, then a `g1` knockout should have the same phenotype as a `g2` knockout. But `g1` has 75% resistance and `g2` has 0%. This isn't the case. The same logic applies to G3.\n*   Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is the transcription factor**.\n\n**4. Synthesize and evaluate the options:**\n\nBased on our analysis, the key conclusions are:\n*   G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (a synergistic interaction).\n*   G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Plausible.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   \"Pleiotropy\" is the wrong term; it means one gene affects multiple traits. We are observing the interaction of two genes on one trait.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is our most likely conclusion.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is the correct interpretation of their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is incorrect, as the double mutant's phenotype (10%) doesn't match the `g1` single mutant's (75%). However, the first two parts of this statement are the strongest and most accurate conclusions we can draw from the data.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Less likely than G2.\n    *   \"Pleiotropy\" is the wrong term.\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": This part is correct (`g1g2` phenotype = `g2` phenotype), but the other two parts are weak or incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOption C contains the two most accurate descriptions of the genetic pathway: that G2 is the likely transcription factor due to its essential/epistatic nature, and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy due to their synergistic interaction. Although the final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, this option provides the best overall explanation of the experimental results among the choices. It is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in that final clause.\n\n<<<C>>>"
