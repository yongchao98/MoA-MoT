    "This problem requires calculating the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in a solution with a given total cobalt concentration and thiocyanate concentration. This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex ion formation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all these complexes.\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n2.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants (βn) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n    - [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n    - [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n    - [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n    - [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n3.  **Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α):** The fraction (αn) of a specific complex [Co(SCN)n] is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in α₂, the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂].\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 1 and 2, we can express α₂ in terms of the stability constants and the free ligand concentration:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Approximate the Ligand Concentration:** The total concentration of the ligand, thiocyanate, is 0.1 M, which is 10 times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion, cobalt (10⁻² M or 0.01 M). Because the ligand is in large excess, the amount of ligand that is consumed to form the complexes is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand [SCN⁻] with its initial total concentration.\n    [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the value:** Now we can plug in the given values into the formula for α₂.\n    - [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    - β₁ = 9\n    - β₂ = 40\n    - β₃ = 63\n    - β₄ = 16\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n    - 1\n    - β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    - β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    - β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    - β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    The denominator is the sum of these terms:\n    Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n    The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\n    Now, calculate the fraction α₂:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n6.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100.\n    Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option A. To be certain, a Python script can perform the calculation efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n# Concentration of the ligand SCN-\nL = 0.1\n\n# The fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, alpha_2, is given by the formula:\n# alpha_2 = (beta2 * L^2) / (1 + beta1*L + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator (the term for the desired complex)\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms for all species)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fraction of the total cobalt that exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This fraction, denoted as α₂, can be determined using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\n**1. Understand the System:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species in the solution:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the Stability Constants:**\nThe concentration of each complex is related to the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free thiocyanate ligand concentration [SCN⁻] by the stability constants (βₙ):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Define the Fraction (α₂):**\nWe want to find the percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex. First, we find its fraction, α₂:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into this equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term is common to all terms and can be canceled out:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Approximate Ligand Concentration:**\nThe total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is significantly lower than the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the thiocyanate is in large excess, and the amount consumed to form complexes is small. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN⁻], as its initial total concentration.\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**5. Calculate α₂:**\nNow, we plug the given values into the formula for α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (often called the alpha function denominator, Σ):\nΣ = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nΣ = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nΣ = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Σ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage:**\nTo express this fraction as a percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option A. The Python code execution confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
