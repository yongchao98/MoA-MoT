    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and all 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most logical structure for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**3. Consider the Positional Isomers**\n\nSince the benzene ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers:\n*   **ortho-haloacetophenone** (1,2-substitution)\n*   **meta-haloacetophenone** (1,3-substitution)\n*   **para-haloacetophenone** (1,4-substitution)\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the Isomers**\n\nWe need to predict the signals (chemical shift, integration, splitting) for the protons in the molecule. The molecule has protons on the aromatic ring (4H) and on the acetyl group's methyl (3H), for a total of 7 protons.\n\n*   **Acetyl Group (-COCH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Because the methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, it will be deshielded and appear around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** The pattern for the 4 aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.\n    *   **ortho-isomer:** All 4 aromatic protons are in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex spectrum with four distinct signals (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not the simple patterns shown in the options.\n    *   **meta-isomer:** This would also lead to a complex pattern, likely with four distinct signals for the 4 non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **para-isomer:** This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent (let's call them Hₐ).\n        *   The two protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent (let's call them Hₑ).\n        *   Each Hₐ proton is coupled only to an adjacent Hₑ proton, so the Hₐ signal will be a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Similarly, each Hₑ proton is coupled only to an adjacent Hₐ proton, so the Hₑ signal will be a **doublet (d)** integrating to **2H**.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and will deshield its ortho protons (Hₐ) significantly, pushing them downfield (higher ppm value) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen (Hₑ). We expect the aromatic signals to be in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** range.\n\n**5. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\nOur predicted spectrum for the most likely isomer, **para-haloacetophenone**, is:\n*   A doublet for 2H (aromatic)\n*   Another doublet for 2H (aromatic)\n*   A singlet for 3H (acetyl methyl) at ~2.3 ppm\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone. We have two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group. The downfield doublet at 7.8 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the deshielding carbonyl group.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The integration of 2H for the singlet at 1.3 ppm is also incorrect for a methyl group.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The shifts at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. A 3H singlet at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a ketone (-COCH₃). The problem's constraints (8 carbons, di-substituted ring) strongly point to a ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the 1H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
