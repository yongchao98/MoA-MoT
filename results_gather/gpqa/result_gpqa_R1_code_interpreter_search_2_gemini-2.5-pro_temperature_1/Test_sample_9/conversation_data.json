    "This question asks to identify which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density. The key physical principle is gravitational compression.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\nThis is our reference point. Earth has an average density (ρ_Earth) of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Mass = 1 M_Earth\n*   Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n**b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\nThis planet is twice as massive as Earth, but its density is explicitly stated to be about the same as Earth's.\n*   Mass = 2 M_Earth\n*   Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n\n**c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\nFor planets with the same composition (e.g., rocky planets made of silicates and iron, like Earth), the density is not constant with mass. A more massive planet has stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth's composition (a \"Super-Earth\") will be significantly denser than Earth.\n*   Mass = 5 M_Earth\n*   Density > ρ_Earth (due to greater gravitational compression)\n\n**d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\nFollowing the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet will have weaker gravity. This results in less compression of its material compared to Earth. Therefore, its overall density will be lower than Earth's.\n*   Mass = 0.5 M_Earth\n*   Density < ρ_Earth (due to weaker gravitational compression)\n\n**Comparison of Densities:**\n*   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nBy comparing the densities, we can see that the planet described in option (c) has the highest density. The increased mass leads to greater self-gravitation, which compresses the planetary materials to a denser state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
