    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the structure and properties of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to understand its structure:\n*   **cyclohex**: A six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-3-ene**: A double bond (C=C) between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group (an aldehyde) at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and pi (Ï€) bonds in a molecule.\n\nLet's count the sources of unsaturation in the reactant:\n1.  **The ring structure**: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n2.  **The C=C double bond in the ring** (cyclohex-3-ene): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n3.  **The C=C double bond in the vinyl group** (-CH=CH2): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n4.  **The C=O double bond in the formyl group** (-CHO): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n5.  **The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group** (-COOH): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nSo, the total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant: C10H12O3.\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, Red P + HI will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds.\n\nEssentially, this reaction will saturate all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) and remove all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule to its parent hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the structure and properties of the product.**\n\nThe reaction will act on the reactant as follows:\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe initial carbon skeleton (a 6-membered ring with three substituents) is preserved. The final product will be a substituted **cyclohexane** (a saturated ring). All the pi bonds from the original functional groups and unsaturations will be gone.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product.**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of rings and pi bonds.\n*   The product still contains the six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   All the pi bonds (C=C and C=O) in the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are no more pi bonds in the product.\n\nThe only remaining source of hydrogen deficiency in the product is the ring itself.\nSo, the IHD of the product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product.\nThe reactant is C10H12O3. The product is the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon, which is a substituted cyclohexane. A monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane with no other rings or double bonds) has the general formula CnH2n. Since the carbon count is 10, the product's formula is C10H20.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for C10H20:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 5 (IHD of the reactant)\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 0 (IHD of an acyclic alkane)\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
