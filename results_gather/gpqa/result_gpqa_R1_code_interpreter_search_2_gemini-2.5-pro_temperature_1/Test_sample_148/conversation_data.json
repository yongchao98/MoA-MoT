    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:** Let's break down the key pieces of information provided.\n    *   **Sample:** A chemically synthesized small peptide.\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. This means this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n        *   The two environments are populated in a roughly 1:1 ratio (based on \"roughly equal integrals\").\n        *   The two species are stable and not rapidly interconverting on the NMR timescale (otherwise, a single, averaged peak would be observed).\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is not the cause, so it's not a simple doublet/triplet etc. It's two distinct signals (e.g., two singlets, or two doublets, etc.).\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). This confirms the presence of two different chemical species that can be physically separated because they have different interactions with the chromatography column.\n        *   The two peaks have equal intensities, confirming the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   The two peaks have the *same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This is a critical clue: the two species are **isomers** (same chemical formula, same mass) of the target peptide.\n        *   The separation occurs at \"elevated temperature.\" This suggests the isomers are quite stable and don't interconvert rapidly even when heated.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) solvent, they have identical physical and chemical properties, including their NMR spectra. They would produce only *one* set of peaks in the NMR. Similarly, they cannot be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. To separate them or see different NMR signals, a chiral environment (like a chiral solvent or a chiral LC column) would be required, which is not mentioned and not the default assumption. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a different chemical compound, not an isomer. While it would likely show up as a separate peak in both NMR and LC, it would have a **different molecular mass**. The problem explicitly states that both LC peaks have the *same mass spectrum* as the expected product. This directly contradicts this option.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties. They are not chemically equivalent and will give distinct NMR spectra. It is expected that an alpha-proton in one diastereomer would have a different chemical shift than the same proton in the other diastereomer. This perfectly explains the two NMR peaks.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they are isomers, they would have the exact same mass. This perfectly explains the two LC peaks with identical mass spectra.\n        *   **How could this happen?** This is common in peptide synthesis. If one of the amino acid building blocks was not chirally pure (i.e., it was a mix of L and D forms), or if epimerization (racemization at one chiral center) occurred during the coupling reaction, a mixture of diastereomers would be produced. Another very common source in peptides is *cis-trans* isomerism around an amide bond (especially involving proline), which creates stable, separable conformers called rotamers. Rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer. This option is fully consistent with all observations.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This term is ambiguous, but most likely refers to a side reaction. For instance, an N-acylurea byproduct could form, or perhaps a dipeptide could be added where a single amino acid was intended. In either case, the side product would be an **impurity**, not an isomer, and would have a **different molecular mass**. This is contradicted by the MS data. If \"double coupling\" is interpreted as a mechanism that causes epimerization, then it is the *cause* of the diastereomer formation, but the most accurate description of the resulting mixture *is* a mixture of diastereoisomers (Option C).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the facts—two distinct species observable by both NMR and LC, present in a 1:1 ratio, and having the same molecular mass—is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
