    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a two-step electric dipole transition in a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a cascade decay. A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the dipole selection rules, as the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\Delta l$ would be 0, but the rule requires $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Intermediate State:** The transition must proceed through an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$. The options suggest the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n_i=2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    *   Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l_i,m_i\\rangle$.\n    *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_i - l_{initial} = l_i - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l_i=1$.\n    *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_i - m_{initial} = m_i - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. Since $l_i=1$, the possible values for $m_i$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    *   Transition: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Selection rule for $l$: $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_i = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   Selection rule for $m$: $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_i = 0 - m_i$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m_i$ (i.e., for $m_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n    *   Therefore, all three paths are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each path:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade path is the product of the branching ratios of each step. The branching ratio for a particular decay channel is the rate of that decay divided by the total decay rate of the initial state.\n\n    *   **First step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_i\\rangle$**\n        *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space.\n        *   Therefore, the emission of the photon is isotropic in the sense that the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed final magnetic sublevels ($m_i = -1, 0, 1$).\n        *   More formally, the transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle 2,1,m_i | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that this quantity is independent of $m_i$ when the initial state has $m=0$.\n        *   Since the rates to the three intermediate states are equal, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the $n=2$ shell, the probability of transitioning to any one of them is the same.\n        *   Total decay channels to $n=2, l=1$: 3.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        *   Probability (Branching Ratio) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Second step: $|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   We need to consider the total decay rate from the intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$.\n        *   According to the dipole selection rules, the state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ (a $2p$ state) can decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state).\n        *   In the non-relativistic theory of the H-atom, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number $n$. Thus, $E_{2s} = E_{2p}$. A transition from $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ to $|2,0,0\\rangle$ would have zero energy difference ($\\omega=0$) and is therefore forbidden (it does occur via the Lamb shift, but that is a relativistic QED effect).\n        *   Therefore, the only available decay channel for the $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ state via a single dipole transition is to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   This means the branching ratio for the second step is 1, regardless of the intermediate $m_i$ value. $P(|2,1,m_i\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for a Specific Path:**\n        *   The probability for the path passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n            $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid route. The probability of the cascade proceeding via this specific path is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option D. The other paths through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ also have a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, which makes options B and C incorrect. Option A has the correct path but an incorrect probability.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
