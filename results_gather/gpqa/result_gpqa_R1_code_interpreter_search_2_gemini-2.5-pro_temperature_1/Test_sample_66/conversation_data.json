    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled orbital angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the desired outcome.**\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of the following outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means the first electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means the second electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Represent the measurement outcome as a state.**\n    The state corresponding to the measurement outcome is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$.\n    For the desired outcome, this state is $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    The final state after measurement, $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    $L_z (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle) = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (L_{1z}|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(L_{2z}|1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(-1\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$\n    $= -2\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$\n    So, the final measured state has a total magnetic quantum number $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    Let $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We have established that $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n    A fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    Since the eigenvalues $-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ are different, the states $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ must be orthogonal.\n    Therefore, their inner product is zero:\n    $\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    The probability is then:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This can also be understood using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The initial state can be expanded in the uncoupled basis:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle |l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle$ is non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n    In our case, $l=2, m=-1$, and we are interested in the component where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m = -1 \\neq -2$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero. It is impossible to obtain this measurement result because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
