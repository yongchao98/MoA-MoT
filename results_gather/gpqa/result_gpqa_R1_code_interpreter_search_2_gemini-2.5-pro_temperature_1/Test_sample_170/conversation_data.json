    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. The yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors:\n1.  The directing effect of the substituent (ortho/para vs. meta).\n2.  The steric and electronic properties of the substituent, which influence the ortho-to-para ratio for ortho/para directors.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer yield will be significant.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nFor meta-directors, the ortho and para positions are strongly deactivated. Therefore, they will produce the smallest amount of the para-isomer. The amount of para-product formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group; the more deactivating the group, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these meta-directing groups:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester group).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these substances is:\nNitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\nThis establishes the beginning of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThese substances will produce a much higher yield of the para-isomer compared to the meta-directors. To order them, we need to compare their para-selectivity (the ratio of para to ortho product).\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk sterically hinders attack at the two adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring attack at the more accessible para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine (-Cl) are a special case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect), they are ortho/para-directing due to resonance electron donation (+M effect). A well-known characteristic of halogen substituents in electrophilic substitution is that they show very high selectivity for the para position, partly due to sterics and electronic factors. Experimental data confirms this; for example, the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (around 67%).\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining the order for the ortho/para directors, we get:\nToluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nThis establishes the end of our sequence: **... 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups**\n\nWe combine the sequence for the meta-directors and the ortho/para-directors. The para yield for any ortho/para-director will be substantially higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho/para-directors order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Match with the given options**\n\nLet's compare our derived sequence with the choices provided:\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOur derived sequence, 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
