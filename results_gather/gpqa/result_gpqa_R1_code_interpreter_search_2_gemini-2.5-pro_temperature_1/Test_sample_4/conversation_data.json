    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Define the Operator and the Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Let's write them down:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.\nSince $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This implies $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. Assuming the vector is not solely along the z-axis (where $\\sin\\theta=0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which means $\\phi=0$ or $\\phi=\\pi$. Let's take the standard convention of $\\phi=0$.\nThe direction vector is therefore:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**2. Construct the Operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n\nSubstituting the matrix forms:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n**4. Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the components of the eigenvector are related by $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector can be written as:\n$|\\psi\\rangle_{unnormalized} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTo get a more symmetric form, we can choose the constant $a$ to be $C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some new constant $C$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle_{unnormalized} = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)/\\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nFor a state vector in quantum mechanics, the norm must be 1. That is, $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\nThe squared norm is:\n$\\left( C^* (\\cos(\\theta/2) \\quad \\sin(\\theta/2)) \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest value for the phase, $C=1$. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors, they do not have units of $\\hbar$.\n*   B) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The dependence on the angle is $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$.\n*   C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Dimensionally wrong and not dependent on the direction $\\theta$.\n*   D) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct. This matches our calculated elements.\n\n<<<D>>>"
