    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Notation**\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, relative to the Sun. The formula is:\n`[A/B] = log10( (n_A / n_B)_star ) - log10( (n_A / n_B)_sun )`\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\nThe term `dex` stands for \"decimal exponent,\" which is another way of saying \"log base 10\".\n\nThe abundance of an element X is often given as `log Îµ(X) = 12 + log10(n_X / n_H)`.\n\nThe question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2\". In the context of stellar abundances, this refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen. So we need to calculate:\n`Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`\n\n### **2. Analyze Star_1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n\nLet's expand these equations using the definition:\n1.  From `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`:\n    `log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun ) = 0`\n    `log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_1 ) = log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun )`\n    This means Star_1 has the same iron-to-hydrogen ratio as the Sun.\n\n2.  From `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`:\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    `log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun )`\n\nWe want to find `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 )`. We know that `log(A/B) = log(A) - log(B)`.\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 ) + log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_1 )`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from above:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = (0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun )) + (log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun ))`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + (log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) - log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun )) + log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun )`\nThe `log10( (n_Fe / n_H)_sun )` terms cancel out.\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\n### **3. Analyze Star_2**\n\nWe are given the following for Star_2:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n\nLet's expand these equations:\n1.  From `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`:\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun ) = 0`\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun )`\n    This means Star_2 has the same magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio as the Sun.\n\n2.  From `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`:\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    `log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun )`\n\nWe want to find `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`. We can rearrange the ratio:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_2 )`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from above:\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = (log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun )) - (0.3 + log10( (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun ))`\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun ) - 0.3 - (log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ))`\nThe `log10( (n_Mg / n_H)_sun )` terms cancel out.\n`log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow we have expressions for the silicon abundance in both stars relative to the Sun's silicon abundance:\n*   `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) + 0.3`\n*   `log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) - 0.3`\n\nThe ratio we need to find is `Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\nLet's take the logarithm of the ratio:\n`log10(Ratio) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`\n`log10(Ratio) = (log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) + 0.3) - (log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) - 0.3)`\n`log10(Ratio) = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) + 0.3 - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) + 0.3`\n`log10(Ratio) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio, we take 10 to the power of 0.6:\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n\nNote that the masses of the stars, the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg, and the methods mentioned (LTE, EW) are not needed for the final calculation.\n\n### **5. Computation**\n\nTo get the numerical value, we compute `10^0.6`.\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```\n>3.9810717055349722\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 3.98. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
