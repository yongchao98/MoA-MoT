    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe problem states that the reaction `NN_initial -> NN_final + X` must satisfy several conditions.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will denote its orbital angular momentum by `l_X`. The problem does not specify the spin of X (`s_X`). A common assumption for such problems is that X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion), so its total angular momentum is `J_X = l_X`. We will proceed with this assumption.\n*   **Final NN State:** Has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check three rules for each potential transition:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f_NN`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J_X`). For `J_f` to be 0, `J_f_NN` and `J_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if `J_f_NN = J_X`. Assuming `s_X = 0`, this simplifies to `J_f_NN = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of X's orbital motion.\n    *   `P_f_NN = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`\n    *   So, `P_f = P_f_NN * P(X) * P_orbital(X) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`. This implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for Final NN State:** The problem gives the constraint `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation requires `S_f + L_f` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f_NN=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Allowed**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f_NN=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Not Permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D state). `J_f_NN=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Fundamental Issue:** A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can only be `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet state) or `S = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0` (singlet state). It is impossible for two nucleons to form a spin `S=3` state. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. This transition is forbidden on these grounds.\n*   However, if we strictly and mechanically apply *only the rules listed in the prompt*, we get:\n    1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n    2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   This creates an ambiguity. The state is impossible, but it passes the test of the explicit rules given. In multiple-choice questions, we should look for the most direct violation of the given constraints. The violation in option B is a direct failure to meet the Pauli statistics rule as stated in the prompt. The issue with C is more fundamental but relies on knowledge not explicitly listed in the constraints to be checked. Therefore, B is the most likely intended answer.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f_NN=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_f_NN = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f_NN = l_X`. This is satisfied.\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **Allowed**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options, transition B is the only one that violates the explicitly stated Pauli principle for a final state with `T=0`. While transition C describes an unphysical final state, it formally satisfies the rules given in the prompt. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave using the given conservation laws and statistics. Option B fails this test directly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
