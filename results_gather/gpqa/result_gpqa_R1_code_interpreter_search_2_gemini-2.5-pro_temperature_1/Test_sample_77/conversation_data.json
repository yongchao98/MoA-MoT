    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer:** Located at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`.\n*   **Retardation:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and an earlier time `t_r`. This is the \"retarded time\".\n*   **Key Vectors and Scalars:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$: Velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\nThe condition relating the observation time `t` and the retarded time `t_r` is that the time difference must be equal to the light travel time over the distance `d`:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Deriving the Potentials\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous charge and current distributions:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge `q`, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$ and the current density is $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\nPerforming the integration with the Dirac delta function is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. The standard derivation (found in textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") leads to the following result:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nHere, the subscript `ret` means all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`. $\\hat{d}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$, i.e., $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$.\n\n### 3. Matching with the Given Options\n\nLet's rewrite the derived potentials to match the format of the options. The key is the denominator term:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{d}/d)\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expressions for V and A.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\nTo eliminate the `c` in the denominator of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and the main denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}$\nSimilarly, multiply the numerator and main denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect potential (uses instantaneous distance `r` instead of retarded distance `d`) and is only a quasi-static approximation.\n*   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect potential and incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n*   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Matches our derived expressions exactly.\n\nThe expressions in option D are the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
