    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" (let's call it S) is considered the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is **v = 60,000 km/s**.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is **Δt₀ = 50 s**. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `distance = speed × time`.\n    *   The speed is `v`, the relative velocity.\n    *   The time must be the time elapsed in the Galaxy reference frame (S), which we'll call `Δt`.\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   `c` is the speed of light, approximately **c = 300,000 km/s**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance in the Galaxy frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the distance formula with the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n8.  **Compute the final value:**\n    *   To get the numerical answer, we can execute a simple calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # speed of ejecta in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # proper time in ejecta's frame in s\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s, standard approximation for physics problems\n\n# Step 1: Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\n# This is time dilation: dt = gamma * dt0\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d)\n# d = v * dt\nd = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{d:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862.18\n<<<\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial reference frames: the Galaxy's frame (which we'll consider the \"stationary\" frame, S) and the supernova ejecta's frame (the \"moving\" frame, S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**, as it's measured in the frame of the event (the clock traveling with the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To calculate this distance (`d`), we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, we calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, often denoted as `β` (beta):\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, we square this value:\n        `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   We substitute the values of `γ` and `Δt₀` into the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now we use the distance formula with the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect, non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
