    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The parent chain is hexane. A ketone is at C-3, and a methoxy group is at C-5. The numbering starts from the end that gives the ketone the lowest number:\n        CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n        1   2   3     4    5        6\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at C-5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH reduces the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The original chiral center at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either face, leading to both possible configurations (R and S) at the newly formed chiral center (C-3).\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since the products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C-5) but opposite configurations at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C-2 and C-4 creates two new chiral centers.\n    *   CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃\n*   **Stereochemical Analysis:** Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction is not stereoselective, so it will produce a racemic mixture (equal amounts) of these two enantiomers.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the central CH₂ group). A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound). The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture on HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol         (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers. It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will have different properties and will give a **separate peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together, giving a **single peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will certainly elute at different times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** We will have one peak for each of the following: (Compound 1), (Compound 2), (Compound 3), and (Compounds 4+5).\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The chiral column can distinguish between all different stereoisomers.\n    *   Compound 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1) -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, but a diastereomer of all others) -> **1 peak**\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are an enantiomeric pair. The chiral column will separate them.\n        *   Compound 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n        *   Compound 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
