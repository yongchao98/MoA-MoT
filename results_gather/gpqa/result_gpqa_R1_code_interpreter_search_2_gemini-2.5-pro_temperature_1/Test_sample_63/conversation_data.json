    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental results to identify and quantify the gaseous products.**\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases (\"only a mixture of gases was formed\").\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect and absorb acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a critical piece of information, indicating that no CO₂ was present in the gas mixture.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n        *   The mass gain is the mass of oxygen atoms. Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, a base, or hot copper. This strongly suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂), which is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts. Let's assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the gaseous products must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B. Let's sum up the moles of each element produced:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O → 0.20 mol × 2 = 0.40 mol of H atoms.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.20 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O atoms.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol of N₂ → 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the mass of these elements to see if it matches the initial mass:\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The calculated mass perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms that salts A and B are composed solely of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   The problem states that A and B form an equimolar mixture.\n    *   The decomposition products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) and the absence of CO₂ or solid residue are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of certain ammonium salts. Let's consider two common ones:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂: Its decomposition is NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n        *   Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃: Its decomposition can vary with temperature. A known reaction is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that salt A is NH₄NO₂ and salt B is NH₄NO₃. We can test this hypothesis.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   The total mass of the mixture is n × (M_A + M_B) = n × (64 + 80) = 144n.\n    *   We know the total mass is 7.20 g: 144n = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Let's calculate the expected products from this mixture:\n        *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: produces 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 reaction): produces (2/2)×0.05 = 0.05 mol N₂, (1/2)×0.05 = 0.025 mol O₂, and (4/2)×0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   Total products expected:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol.\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   These calculated amounts exactly match the amounts determined from the experimental data. Therefore, the salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.**\n    *   The question asks for the sum of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
