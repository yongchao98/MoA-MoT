    "SMEFT, or the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that preserves its fundamental principles while allowing for new physics effects at higher energy scales. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory. As such, it is built upon the framework of special relativity, which requires invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** The Poincare group is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity. It includes the Lorentz group plus spacetime translations. Since the laws of physics are assumed to be the same everywhere and at all times (in the absence of gravity), the Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. As SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory, it must be invariant under the Poincare group.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity inversion. It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most famously in the weak interactions involving the CKM matrix. SMEFT is designed to parameterize not only the known SM interactions but also potential new physics, which may introduce additional sources of CP violation. Indeed, many dimension-6 operators in SMEFT are explicitly CP-violating. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT (Charge-Parity-Time reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a drastic departure from the fundamental framework of QFT itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are the fundamental spacetime symmetries (Lorentz and Poincare) and the symmetry guaranteed by the CPT theorem. CP symmetry is explicitly violated and is not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
