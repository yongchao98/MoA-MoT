    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    2.  **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition.\n        *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`.\n        *   This intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   The reaction is typically performed by either generating HCN in situ (by adding a stronger acid to NaCN) or by adding an acid in a subsequent workup step.\n        *   Looking at the options for A:\n            *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic workup step (e.g., adding aqueous HCl or H2SO4). This is a standard procedure to protonate the alkoxide and yield the final cyanohydrin. This is a very suitable choice.\n            *   `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) forms an adduct with ketones and is used for purification. It is not the correct reagent for this transformation.\n    4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A should be an acid source, and `H3O⁺` is the best fit.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction of a nitrile.\n    2.  **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either acid or base.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4). The nitrile is first converted to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt. The overall reaction is: `R-CN + 2 H2O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺`.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH). This forms a carboxylate salt (`R-COO⁻`) and ammonia. An acidic workup is then required to protonate the carboxylate to get the final carboxylic acid.\n    3.  **Role of Reagent B:** The reaction directly produces a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`), not a carboxylate salt. This points towards acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Reagent 'B' acts as the acid catalyst in the presence of water.\n        *   Looking at the options for B:\n            *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. This is a suitable choice.\n            *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could potentially catalyze the reaction, it would be much slower and less efficient than a strong acid. Strong acids are preferred for this transformation.\n    4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B should be a strong acid catalyst, and `HCl` is the best fit.\n\n*   **Final Evaluation:**\n    *   We determined that A is `H3O⁺`.\n    *   We determined that B is `HCl`.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH (Incorrect B)\n        *   B) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl (Incorrect A)\n        *   C) A = H3O+, B = HCl (Correct A and B)\n        *   D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH (Incorrect A and B)\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is A = `H3O⁺` and B = `HCl`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
