    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one + NaH, then Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl Bromide (PhCH2Br):** An alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first part is a good nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn or -OCH₂Ph). This is a common method for protecting an alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also called tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction converts a ketone (or aldehyde) into a tosylhydrazone. The lone pair on the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The structure is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aq. NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl):** A mild acid used for workup to protonate any anionic species.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**. The dianion formed by the action of n-BuLi undergoes spontaneous elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to generate a vinyllithium intermediate. This vinyllithium is then quenched (protonated) by the aqueous workup.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone functional group is replaced by a C=C double bond, effectively removing the original ketone oxygen and converting the C-N bond to a C-C pi bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position. The overall result is the conversion of a ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain untouched. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Pd/C, H₂**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in the molecule (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ is also highly effective at cleaving benzyl ethers (a process called hydrogenolysis). The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) will be cleaved back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), releasing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Renaming this final molecule according to IUPAC rules, it is a substituted methanol. The main chain is methanol, and the substituent is a (3-isopropylcyclohexyl) group.\n*   **Final Structure:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Incorrect.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This structure still contains the tosylhydrazide group. Incorrect.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol** - This structure correctly reflects the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. **This is the correct answer.**\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This suggests a nucleophilic attack of butyllithium on the ketone, which does not happen in a Shapiro reaction. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
