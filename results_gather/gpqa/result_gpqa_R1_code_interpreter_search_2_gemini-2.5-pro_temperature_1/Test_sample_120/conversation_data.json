    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The numbering system for bicyclic compounds starts at one bridgehead (C1), goes around the longest bridge (C2-C3-C4-C5) to the other bridgehead (C6), and then numbers the atoms in the shorter bridge (O7).\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This is the most complex part. We need to determine the 3D arrangement of all groups.\n    *   The fusion of the epoxide to the 6-membered ring must be **cis**. This means the two C-O bonds (C1-O7 and C6-O7) are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is pointing **up (beta)**.\n    *   This cis-fusion forces the other substituents on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C6) to be on the opposite face. In this case, the methyl group at C1 and the hydrogen at C6. However, the given stereochemistry (1R, 6S) seems contradictory if both are *trans* to the epoxide. Let's verify.\n        *   **Priorities at C1:** O > C6 > C2 > Me. If Me is down (alpha, trans to the up-epoxide), the configuration is (1R). This matches the name.\n        *   **Priorities at C6:** O > C1 > C5 > H. If H is down (alpha, trans to the up-epoxide), the configuration is (6R). This contradicts the name (6S).\n    *   To obtain (6S), the hydrogen at C6 must be **up (beta, cis to the up-epoxide)**. A swap from down to up inverts the configuration from R to S. This implies an unusual conformation, but it is necessary to satisfy the given IUPAC name.\n    *   **Stereocenters C3 and C4:** For (3R) and (4R), with the methyl groups being higher priority than hydrogen, both methyl groups must be pointing **up (beta)**. They are cis to each other and cis to the epoxide ring.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide ring: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C1: **down (alpha)**\n*   Hydrogen at C6: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C3: **up (beta)**\n*   Methyl at C4: **up (beta)**\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (`Me⁻`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Rule 1: Regioselectivity:** The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur here.\n    *   This immediately rules out options A and B, which would result from an attack at C1. (Attack at C1 would lead to a product with an OH on C6 and two methyls on C1, which when re-numbered according to IUPAC rules gives a 2,2-dimethylcyclohexanol derivative).\n\n*   **Rule 2: Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n    *   This is a classic Sₙ2-type reaction. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   Since the epoxide C-O bond at C6 is **up (beta)**, the `Me⁻` nucleophile must attack from the **down (alpha)** side.\n    *   The configuration at C6, which was **(S)**, will invert to **(R)**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product Structure and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The `Me⁻` attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻). Subsequent acidic or aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n2.  **Stereochemistry of Centers:**\n    *   **Center of Attack (Old C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to (R). In the final product, this carbon will be C2 in the IUPAC name. So, we expect a **(2R)** configuration.\n    *   **Other Epoxide Carbon (Old C1):** This carbon is not attacked, and its configuration is retained. It started as (1R) and remains **(1R)**. This will be C1 in the product name.\n    *   **Other Chiral Centers (Old C3 and C4):** These are remote from the reaction site, so their configurations are also retained. Old C3 was (R), and Old C4 was (R).\n3.  **Renaming the Product (IUPAC):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the -OH at Old C1, so this carbon becomes **New C1**.\n    *   To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number clockwise around the ring.\n    *   Old C6 (the site of attack) becomes **New C2**.\n    *   Old C5 becomes **New C3**.\n    *   Old C4 becomes **New C4**.\n    *   Old C3 becomes **New C5**.\n    *   Old C2 becomes **New C6**.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the base name for options C and D.\n\n4.  **Final Stereochemistry of Product:**\n    *   New C1 (from Old C1) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C2 (from Old C6) is **(R)** due to inversion.\n    *   New C4 (from Old C4) is **(R)**.\n    *   New C5 (from Old C3) is **(R)**.\n\nThe resulting product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nComparing our derived product with the given options:\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect regiochemistry)\nB) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect regiochemistry)\nC) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Matches our analysis)\n\nThe correct product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
