    "The user is asking to identify the physical theory from the given options that does not require regularization at high energies. Let's analyze each option.\n\n1.  **Regularization**: In physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), regularization is a method used to deal with infinite, divergent, or nonsensical expressions that arise in calculations. These divergences typically occur because of contributions from physical processes at very high energies (ultraviolet or UV divergences) or, equivalently, very short distances. Regularization introduces a parameter (a \"regulator,\" such as a momentum cutoff) to make these divergent integrals finite. This is a temporary mathematical step, and the regulator is removed at the end of the calculation through a process called renormalization.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Classical Electrodynamics**: This is a classical field theory. It describes the interactions of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. While the theory is very successful, it faces a problem with the concept of a point charge. The self-energy of a point charge (the energy of the electric field it creates) is infinite. This can be seen as a classical divergence at short distances (high energies). To resolve this, one might have to assume the charge is spread over a small volume, which is a form of regularization. However, the term \"regularization at high energies\" is most characteristically used in the context of loop diagrams in quantum field theory, which do not exist in classical electrodynamics.\n\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory**: This is a theoretical framework that aims to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. In superstring theory, the fundamental constituents of reality are not point-like particles (as in QFT) but one-dimensional \"strings.\" One of the most celebrated features of superstring theory is that it is believed to be \"UV-finite.\" This means that calculations of scattering amplitudes do not produce the ultraviolet divergences found in QFTs. The extended nature of the string \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances (high energies, like the Planck scale), naturally taming the divergences that would otherwise appear. Because the theory is intrinsically free from these high-energy divergences, it does not require an ad-hoc regularization procedure.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force. It is the archetype of a successful renormalizable QFT. When calculating physical quantities in QED using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams), one encounters loop diagrams that lead to divergent integrals (UV divergences). To make sense of these calculations, one must first regularize these integrals (e.g., using a momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization) and then renormalize the theory by absorbing the infinities into the definitions of physical parameters like mass and charge. Therefore, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like QED, QCD is a renormalizable QFT. It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its loop calculations, which must be handled by regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD also requires regularization.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    Both QED and QCD are quantum field theories that are known to have ultraviolet divergences and therefore require regularization. Classical Electrodynamics has a self-energy problem for point charges, but the modern concept of regularization is primarily a tool for quantum field theories. Superstring Theory, by its very construction, is believed to be free from these high-energy divergences because its fundamental objects are extended strings rather than points. This inherent finiteness means it does not need the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\n<<<B>>>"
