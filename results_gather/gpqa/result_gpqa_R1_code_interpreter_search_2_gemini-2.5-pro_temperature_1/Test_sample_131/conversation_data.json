    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all the given compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: The base benzene ring is C6. Four methyl groups (CH3) replace four hydrogens. The formula is C6H(6-4)(CH3)4 = C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This is true for 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: The base benzene ring is C6. Two ethyl groups (C2H5) replace two hydrogens. The formula is C6H(6-2)(C2H5)2 = C6H4(C4H10) = C10H14.\nAll options have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a single singlet (4H).\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (4H) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (6H).\n    *   Since the problem states there are only singlets in the aliphatic region, any mixture containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be ruled out. This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in many cases they appear as a singlet due to similar magnetic environments or small coupling constant. We will assume they give one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair (second signal, 6H). Both will be singlets.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (one signal, 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n**4. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers gives a single aromatic singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will have two sets of aromatic protons, each contributing 2H. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this will result in two singlets, each with an integration of 2H. The ratio 2H:2H is 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with any pair of the tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is the sum from both compounds: 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of a total of 24 protons means the integrations of the three signals are:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that gives three aliphatic signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Remaining Options based on the Aliphatic Signals:**\n\nLet's see which pair of compounds produces the required set of signals {12H, 6H, 6H}. We'll combine the aliphatic signals predicted for each compound in the pair.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Durene provides: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Isodurene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect, unless one assumes the two 3H signals from Isodurene accidentally overlap, which is a significant assumption.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Isodurene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals. This is a very poor match for the \"three signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Durene provides: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Prehnitene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n    *   This combination gives exactly three signals with the correct integrations (12H, 6H, 6H), which corresponds to the observed 2:1:1 ratio. This assumes that the three signals (the one from Durene and the two from Prehnitene) are all resolved and do not overlap. This is the most straightforward interpretation of the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly explains the aliphatic signals described in the problem (three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio).\n\n<<<D>>>"
