    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion. The bromine is on a primary carbon activated by the adjacent carbonyl group, making the reaction efficient.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess Sodium Hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H2`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate product still has one acidic α-proton. Since excess NaH is used, this proton is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na+[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This results in a time-averaged structure with a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the carbon with the substituents), C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent. They will produce one signal (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are equivalent. They will produce a second signal (a quartet).\n    *   This gives **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. Carbon C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two geminal protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule is prochiral at C1. Replacing one proton versus the other with a different group would create diastereomers. Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct. Due to the ring's symmetry, the set of two protons on C2 is identical to the set on C6. This results in **2 signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** For the same reason, the two geminal protons on C3 (and C5) are also diastereotopic and are in a different chemical environment than the C2/C6 protons. This gives another **2 signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This is a subtle point. One might assume that the plane of symmetry makes the two geminal protons on C4 enantiotopic (and thus give one signal). However, this is incorrect because the two substituents on C1 are different (-CN and -COOEt). Let's consider the dynamic ring-flipping process. In one chair conformation, one C4 proton is axial and interacts with the axial substituent on C1 (e.g., -CN). In the flipped chair, this proton becomes equatorial, while the other proton becomes axial and interacts with the other substituent (-COOEt), which is now axial. Since -CN and -COOEt are different, the time-averaged environments of the two C4 protons are not identical. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals** for the two protons on C4.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring (C2/C6, C3/C5, C4): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
