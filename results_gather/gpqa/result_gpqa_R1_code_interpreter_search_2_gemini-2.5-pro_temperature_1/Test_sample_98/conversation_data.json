    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not help differentiate between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons, it results in complex splitting (a multiplet of multiplets).\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means the proton giving rise to this signal is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton (1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** neighboring protons (2+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to **three** neighboring protons (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hx) with the following neighbors: a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. `(CH)-CHx-(CH₂)-(CH₃)`\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of **two** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hy) with the following neighbors: a CH group and two different CH₂ groups. `(CH)-CHy-(CH₂)-(CH₂)`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's examine the protons on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` carbons) for each molecule, as they will have the most complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`): Coupled to H at C4 (d), CH₂ at C2 (t), and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Proton at C4 (`-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-`): Coupled to H at C3 (d) and two different CH₃ groups (q and q). This does not give a dtt.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    Let's draw the main chain and label the key protons Ha and Hb.\n    ```\n          Ha    Hb\n          |     |\n    CH₃ - C  -  C  - CH₂(c) - COOH\n          |     |\n        C₂H₅(d) C₂H₅(e)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton Ha:**\n        *   Coupled to **Hb** (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   Coupled to the adjacent **CH₃** group (3H) → quartet (q)\n        *   Coupled to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (C₂H₅(d)) (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The resulting signal for Ha is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton Hb:**\n        *   Coupled to **Ha** (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   Coupled to the adjacent **CH₂(c)** group (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   Coupled to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (C₂H₅(e)) (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The resulting signal for Hb is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **This molecule exhibits both required splitting patterns.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH₂(b)-CHa(C₂H₅)-`): Coupled to Hb (d), CH₂ at C4 (t), and CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   Proton at C2 (`-CHb(C₂H₅)-COOH`): Coupled to Ha (d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a doublet of triplets. It does not give a dtq.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH₂(b)-CHa(CH₃)-`): Coupled to Hb (d), CH₂(b) (t), and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Proton at C2 (`-CHb(CH₃)-COOH`): Coupled to Ha (d) and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a doublet of quartets. It does not give a dtt.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly structure B, `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, contains protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
