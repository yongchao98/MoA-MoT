    "This problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone that can be deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK will abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 is the nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n    *   The C6 of the cyclohexanone ring forms a new carbon-carbon bond with the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring had an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    *   After the reaction, a new substituent, `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` (from ethyl acrylate), is attached to the C6 carbon.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring where C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product by treating the ethyl propanoate moiety as the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate (`ethyl OOC-CH₂(2')-CH₂(3')`).\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3' of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring. The IUPAC rules for such complex substituents can be tricky, but the key is to match the connectivity. Let's number the ring of the substituent starting from the point of attachment as C1. The ketone carbonyl must be given the lowest possible number.\n        *   C1 (point of attachment) corresponds to the original C6 of the ketone. It has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 corresponds to the original C1 of the ketone. It now has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 corresponds to the original C2 of the ketone. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Solvent/Proton Source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate anion):**\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The carbanion (`CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   Let's connect the fragments:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)–`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `–CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   Combining them gives the product: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so this carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is a 6-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given in options A and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>"
