    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an \"ester group\". An ester has the functional group -COO-. This adds at least one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum gives crucial information about the types of protons and their arrangement.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C carbons, H hydrogens, and O oxygens is:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    Let's calculate the DBE for the structural features we know:\n    *   Aromatic ring: 1 ring and 3 double bonds = 4 DBE.\n    *   Ester group (-COO-): Contains one C=O double bond = 1 DBE.\n    *   Vinyl-H signals: This indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) = 1 DBE.\n\n    The total DBE required by the described structure is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given options:\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (Possible)\n    *   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (Possible)\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options A and B. We are left with C and D.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data in Detail:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring gives two signals for its 4 aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first one, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula -C₃H₅.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\"**: One methyl group (-CH₃) comes from the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\"**: This is a critical piece of information. It rules out any ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or similar alkyl chains.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), which provides the vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. This fragment is -C₃H₅.\n    *   The other substituent must be the ester group and contain the second methyl group, with no -CH₂- groups. The two simplest possibilities for the ester part are:\n        1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH₃.\n        2.  An acetate group: -O-CO-CH₃.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities by calculating the total formula:\n        *   **Structure 1 (Methyl Ester):** The substituents are -CH=CH-CH₃ and -COOCH₃.\n            *   Formula = C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + CH₃ (from ester) + CO₂ (ester carbonyls) = C(6+3+1)H(4+5+3)O₂ = **C₁₀H₁₂O₂**. This is not among the options.\n        *   **Structure 2 (Acetate):** The substituents are -CH=CH-CH₃ and -O-CO-CH₃.\n            *   Formula = C₆H₄ (ring) + C₃H₅ (propenyl) + C₂H₃O₂ (acetate group) = C(6+3+2)H(4+5+3)O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   This structure (an isomer of propenylphenyl acetate) perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data and results in the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   The derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, corresponds to option C.\n    *   We previously narrowed the choices down to C (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and D (C₁₂H₁₄O₂).\n    *   The difference between these two formulas is one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH₂ group).\n    *   Since the NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH₂- groups**, we can definitively rule out option D.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the provided information is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
