    "An optically active compound must be chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation for chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a).\n    *   The presence of these descriptors indicates that the molecule has chiral centers. A specific stereoisomer with defined chiral centers is chiral unless it is a meso compound (an achiral compound with chiral centers).\n    *   Given the complex, asymmetric structure, it is not a meso compound. Its mirror image, the (3aS,7aR) isomer, would be non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer with the (2R, 3S) configuration is a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In the case of (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, there is a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   It is a diastereomer of the meso-(2R,3S) form.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer, it is chiral and lacks any internal symmetry elements.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the -CH2-CH= path (C2-C3), and 4) the -CH2-CH2-CH= path (C6-C5-C4). Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The 's' notation (syn) indicates they are all on the same side of the ring (all cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring. It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of CH2 groups, none of which are chiral.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups, so it is not chiral.\n    *   C2 is a CH2 group, not chiral.\n    *   C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (one is C4, the other is the substituent), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, C3 is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
