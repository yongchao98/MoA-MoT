    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the basic relationships:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx) and Distance (d):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to a celestial object. We can write this relationship as:\n        `plx = 1/d` or equivalently `d = 1/plx`\n\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is a constant.\n        `ρ = constant`\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) located in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is at a distance `d` from the observer, and has a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness. The surface area of a sphere is `4πd²`.\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this volume `dV` is:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   Our goal is to find how the number of stars *per unit parallax range* (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`). To do this, we need to express everything in the equation `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd` in terms of `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. When considering the number of stars in a range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   Now, we substitute both `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into our equation for the number of stars in the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying this gives:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax range:**\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can get this by simply dividing both sides of our last equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴)`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   In the final expression, `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants. Therefore, the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and the parallax itself is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
