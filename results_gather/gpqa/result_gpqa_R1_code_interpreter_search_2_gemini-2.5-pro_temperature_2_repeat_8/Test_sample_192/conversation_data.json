    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given that the number of stars, `N`, in a specific region varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relation: `N ∝ 1/plx⁵` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance, which can be written as `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Relationships:**\n    *   The fundamental relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) is that they are inversely proportional. Mathematically, this is expressed as: `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" is standard astronomical language for the cumulative count of stars with a parallax *greater* than a certain value `plx`. Stars with a larger parallax are closer. So, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from the observer out to a distance corresponding to parallax `plx`.\n\n3.  **Translate from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We are given `N(>plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   Since stars with parallax greater than `plx` are the same as stars with a distance less than `r = 1/plx`, we can rewrite the number of stars as a function of distance. Let's call the number of stars within distance `r` as `N(<r)`.\n    *   To do this, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given relation:\n        `N(<r) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n        `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Quantity:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression `N(<r) ∝ r⁵` with respect to `r`.\n    *   Let's introduce a constant of proportionality, `k`, so `N(<r) = k * r⁵`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Proportionality:**\n    *   From the differentiation, we can see that `dN/dr` is directly proportional to `r⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r⁴`.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r⁴` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
