    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent relationships:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is at position C1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** is at position C2. This is a moderately activating, *ortho, para*-directing group. Its bulkiness is a major factor in directing substitutions.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** is at position C3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\nThe key structural features are the relative positions of the substituents, which form a crowded 1,2,3-pattern:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Evaluate Retrosynthetic Possibilities (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Could nitration be the last step?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para*-directors. They would direct an incoming electrophile (like NO2+) to positions C4 and C6, not C3. So, direct nitration as the final step is not feasible for a high-yield synthesis.\n*   **Could etherification (adding the -OEt group) be the last step?** This would likely proceed via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. This is a plausible final step (`-OH + base -> -O- + EtBr -> -OEt`). The challenge then becomes synthesizing this specific phenol.\n*   **Could Friedel-Crafts alkylation (adding the -tBu group) be the last step?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on rings deactivated by a nitro group. Even if it worked, the strong *o,p*-directing -OEt group would direct the incoming -tBu group to positions 2, 4, or 6, leading to a mixture of products, and position 2 would be sterically hindered.\n\nThe most challenging part is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially getting the -tBu and -NO2 groups *ortho* to each other. A direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the *para*-isomer, with the *ortho*-isomer being a minor product. To achieve high yield, a more controlled strategy is required, often involving **blocking groups**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Provided Options using a Forward Synthesis Approach**\n\nThe reagent `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation) suggests the use of the sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a reversible blocking/directing group. This is a classic strategy for controlling regiochemistry. Let's analyze the options, assuming this strategy is key. All options start with the tert-butylation of benzene.\n\nLet's focus on **Option A**, which appears the most strategically sound at the beginning.\n\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:**\n    *   `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step ii) SO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:**\n    *   This is sulfonation. The -tBu group is *o,p*-directing, but due to its large size, substitution at the *para* position is overwhelmingly favored.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n\n*   **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid:**\n    *   This is nitration. We have a -tBu group at C1 and a -SO3H group at C4.\n    *   The activating -tBu group directs electrophiles to its *ortho* positions (C2, C6).\n    *   The deactivating -SO3H group directs electrophiles to its *meta* positions (C2, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming NO2+ to the same positions (C2/C6). This results in a high yield of a single product.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Crucially, in this molecule, the **-tBu and -NO2 groups are meta to each other**. My apologies, let me recount this critical step. Let's redraw and number: Let tBu be at C1. Then SO3H is at C4. Nitration occurs at C2. The relationship between C1 and C2 is **ortho**.\n    *   Correct analysis: The intermediate is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**, and the -tBu and -NO2 groups are **ortho** to each other. This is the required relationship for the final product.\n\nThe first three steps have successfully and in high-yield established the correct ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, which is the most difficult challenge of this synthesis. Now we must see if the remaining steps can convert this intermediate to the final product.\n\nThe sequence in option A appears garbled or contains typos (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` on a diazonium salt is not standard). However, let's try to decipher the *intent* of the listed reagents, as this is likely a puzzle about functional group interconversions.\n\nA logical, though complex, path to the target from `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid` exists by re-ordering the subsequent reagents provided in option A.\n\n1.  **Start with the intermediate:** `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n2.  **Reduce the nitro group** (reagent `iv: Fe/HCl`): This gives `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n3.  **Diazotize the amino group** (reagent `v: NaNO2/HCl`): This forms `4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n4.  **Convert diazonium to phenol** (reagent `vii: H3O+, H2O/Heat`): This produces `4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid`.\n5.  **Nitrate the activated phenol ring** (reagent `vi: HNO3/H2SO4`):\n    *   We have three directing groups: -OH (strong *o,p*), -tBu (mod *o,p*), -SO3H (meta).\n    *   -OH (at C2) directs to C1 (blocked), C3, C5.\n    *   -tBu (at C4) directs to C3, C5.\n    *   -SO3H (at C1) directs to C3, C5.\n    *   All groups cooperatively direct the new nitro group to position C3 or C5. Let's choose C3.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  **Convert the phenol to an ether** (reagent `ix: NaOH/EtBr`): This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n7.  **Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group** (reagent `viii: dilute H2SO4`, desulfonation): This yields the final product.\n    *   Final Product: **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (IUPAC name after renumbering for lowest locants).\n\nThis long and convoluted pathway correctly yields the target molecule. Although the steps in Option A are not in the correct order and step iii (nitration) appears twice (as vi), the set of reagents provided in A is the only one that allows for a logical (if rearranged) high-yield synthesis. The initial three steps are the most logical and powerful starting point among all choices for establishing the key ortho relationship. Therefore, Option A represents the most plausible set of transformations, despite its apparent errors in sequence order. The other options are more deeply flawed as they either use incorrect reactions (e.g., nitrating an unprotected aniline in C and D) or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nFinal check of the other options:\n*   **B)** Garbled sequence.\n*   **C)** Starts with aniline alkylation (problematic) and nitration of the resulting aniline (also problematic).\n*   **D)** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline leads to the wrong isomer (2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline, where NO2 and tBu are meta).\n\nTherefore, Option A, despite its confusing order, contains the necessary reagents and the correct initial strategy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
