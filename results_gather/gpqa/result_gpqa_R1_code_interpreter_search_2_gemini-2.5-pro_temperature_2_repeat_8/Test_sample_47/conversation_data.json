    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂).**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\nThis is a reaction of an alpha-haloketone with a strong base. The characteristic reaction under these conditions is the Favorskii rearrangement.\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular SN2 attack, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one.\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses in a way that breaks one of the bonds to the three-membered ring, leading to a ring contraction.\n4.  After protonation during workup (which is implied), the six-membered ring has been converted into a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride replaces the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the acid with a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Now, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. This is equivalent to determining the number of unique signals that would appear in a proton NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to a formyl group (-CHO). At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation, meaning its conformations interconvert quickly. On the NMR timescale, this rapid motion results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1, bisecting the rest of the ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It's a unique methine proton. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are adjacent to C1. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (a CH₂ group) are diastereotopic. This means the proton 'cis' to the C1-H bond has a different chemical environment than the proton 'trans' to the C1-H bond.\n    *   The two 'cis' protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. (1 type of H)\n    *   The two 'trans' protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. (1 type of H)\n    So, there are two distinct types of hydrogens on the C2/C5 carbons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are beta to the substituent and are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic.\n    *   The two 'cis' protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other. (1 type of H)\n    *   The two 'trans' protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other. (1 type of H)\n    So, there are another two distinct types of hydrogens on the C3/C4 carbons.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2/C5 protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 protons: 2 types\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
