    "The problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the system of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nThe system has three spins, and each can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). Therefore, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. We need to calculate the energy E for each state.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible configurations (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the corresponding energy.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\nThis happens in two configurations:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E₁ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E₂ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nSo, there are 2 states with energy E = -3J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis happens in the remaining 6 configurations:\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    E₃ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    E₄ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    E₅ = -J [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J [-1] = J\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    E₆ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J [-1] = J\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    E₇ = -J [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    E₈ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = J\n\nSo, there are 6 states with energy E = J. The degeneracy of this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nNow, we can compute the partition function Z by summing the Boltzmann factors for all states, taking into account the degeneracies of the energy levels:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
