    "Analyse the spectroscopic data:\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options provided are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   The absence of vinyl-hydrogen signals confirms that the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all the proposed structures.\n    *   The key to identifying the structure lies in the complex splitting patterns observed:\n        *   **Signal 1**: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n        *   **Signal 2**: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n\n    *   These complex patterns arise when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. The multiplicity is predicted by the n+1 rule, where n is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   A **doublet (d)** results from coupling to 1 neighboring proton (`-CH-`).\n        *   A **triplet (t)** results from coupling to 2 neighboring protons (`-CH₂-`).\n        *   A **quartet (q)** results from coupling to 3 neighboring protons (`-CH₃`).\n\n    *   For a signal to be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, the corresponding proton (let's call it Hₐ) must be vicinally coupled (i.e., on an adjacent carbon) to three different groups:\n        1.  A single proton (`-CH-`) to cause the doublet splitting.\n        2.  A methylene group (`-CH₂-`) with 2 protons to cause the triplet splitting.\n        3.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`) with 3 protons to cause the quartet splitting.\n        This means we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n    *   For a signal to be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, the corresponding proton (let's call it Hₙ) must be vicinally coupled to three different groups:\n        1.  A single proton (`-CH-`) to cause the doublet splitting.\n        2.  A methylene group (`-CH₂-`) with 2 protons to cause the first triplet splitting.\n        3.  Another methylene group (`-CH₂-`) with 2 protons to cause the second triplet splitting.\n        This means we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\nAnalyse each option:\nLet's parse the condensed formulas and determine the IUPAC names and structures to analyze their respective protons. We assume standard notation where groups in parentheses are branches off the main chain.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n    `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(CH₃)(4)-CH₂CH₃(5,6)`\n    - Proton at C3: Neighbors are CH₂(2H at C2) and CH(1H at C4). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    - Proton at C4: Neighbors are CH(1H at C3) and CH₂(2H at C5). This would also give a dt.\n    - This structure does not match the observed spectra.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(CH₃)₂(4,4)`\n    - Proton at C3: Neighbors are CH₂(2H at C2) and CH(1H at C4). This would give a dt.\n    - Proton at C4: Neighbors are CH(1H at C3) and two CH₃ groups (6H). This would give a doublet of septets (d sept).\n    - This structure does not match the observed spectra.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `HOOC-CH(C₂H₅)(2)-CH(C₂H₅)(3)-CH₂CH₃(4,5)`\n    - Proton at C2: Neighbors are CH(1H at C3) and the ethyl CH₂(2H). This gives a dt.\n    - Proton at C3: Neighbors are CH(1H at C2), the ethyl CH₂(2H), and CH₂(2H at C4). This would give a dtt.\n    - This structure gives a `dtt` signal but lacks a proton that would produce a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    Let's derive the structure. Parsing the formula as `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH–CH(C₂H₅)–CH₂COOH`, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the COOH group.\n    Structure:\n    ```\n          (b)CH₂CH₃  (c)CH₃\n            |         |\n    HOOC–CH₂(a)–CH(H*)–CH(H**)–CH₂(e)–CH₃(f)\n      1    2       3       4        5       6\n    ```\n    This structure is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's analyze the key protons H* and H**:\n\n    - **Proton H* at C3**: This `CH` group is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH₂` group at C2 (protons a). (2H → triplet)\n        2.  The `CH` group at C4 (proton H**). (1H → doublet)\n        3.  The `CH₂` group of the ethyl side chain at C3 (protons b). (2H → triplet)\n        The signal for proton H* would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    - **Proton H** at C4**: This `CH` group is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` group at C3 (proton H*). (1H → doublet)\n        2.  The `CH₂` group at C5 (protons e). (2H → triplet)\n        3.  The `CH₃` group of the methyl side chain at C4 (protons c). (3H → quartet)\n        The signal for proton H** would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to option C is the only one that would produce both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, it must be the correct compound.\n\n```python\n# Final verification of the logic.\n# The user wants to identify a compound from a list of four options based on FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n#\n# FTIR data indicates a carboxylic acid.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogen signals:** This indicates the absence of any C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Complex splitting patterns:** This is the key information for distinguishing between the isomers. We need to find the structure that would produce signals with these specific multiplicities. The multiplicity is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n        *   This means the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to three neighboring protons (a -CH₃- group).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a **CH** proton that is directly adjacent to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and a **CH₃** group.\n\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n        *   This means the proton responsible for this signal is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (another -CH₂- group).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a **CH** proton that is directly adjacent to a **CH** group and two non-equivalent **CH₂** groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Proposed Structures**\n\nLet's draw out the structure for each option and analyze the environments of the CH protons. The naming is based on IUPAC rules, where the carboxyl carbon is C1.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n*   The protons at C2 and C3 are CH protons. Neither is adjacent to three different types of proton groups that would match dtq or dtt.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH(Me)₂(4)`\n*   Proton at C3 (CH): Adjacent to CH₂ at C2 (triplet) and CH at C4 (doublet). Signal would be a **dt**. Not a match.\n*   Proton at C4 (CH): Adjacent to CH at C3 (doublet) and two CH₃ groups (septet). Signal would be a **doublet of septets**. Not a match.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n*   Proton at C3 (CH): Adjacent to CH at C2 (doublet), CH₂ at C4 (triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n*   However, this structure does not contain a CH proton adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, *and* a CH₃ group. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtq** signal. Not a match.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(a)-CH(H*)(Et)-CH(H**)(Me)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(f)`\n*   Let's analyze the two chiral center protons, H\\* and H\\*\\*.\n\n*   **Proton H\\* at C3:** This proton is on a CH group. Let's see its neighbors.\n    1.  The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons, 'a') → gives **triplet** splitting.\n    2.  The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton, H\\*\\*) → gives **doublet** splitting.\n    3.  The `CH₂` group of the ethyl side-chain at C3 (2 protons) → gives **triplet** splitting.\n    *   The combined splitting pattern for H\\* is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **Proton H\\*\\* at C4:** This proton is on a CH group. Let's see its neighbors.\n    1.  The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton, H\\*) → gives **doublet** splitting.\n    2.  The `CH₂` group at C5 (2 protons, 'e') → gives **triplet** splitting.\n    3.  The `CH₃` group of the methyl side-chain at C4 (3 protons) → gives **quartet** splitting.\n    *   The combined splitting pattern for H\\*\\* is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure **C** is the only compound that has two protons with the correct neighboring environments to produce both a **doublet of triplets of triplets** and a **doublet of triplets of quartets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
