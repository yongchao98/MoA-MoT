    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of a vector operator $\\vec{P}$ in matrix form. Let's write them down.\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the standard spin-1/2 operators, where $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, and $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in 3D spherical coordinates is given by $(\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    Since $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. For an arbitrary direction (i.e., $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$ (or $\\pi$, but the standard choice is $\\phi=0$).\n    So, the unit vector for the direction is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. Here, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n    Substituting the components:\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    $P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    We can factor out $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Substituting the operator, eigenvalue, and eigenvector into the equation:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n    Let's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using equation (1):\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Now, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is any vector of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a$ for convenience. Let's set $a=1$.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    A physically meaningful state vector must be normalized, meaning its inner product with itself is 1. That is, $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which for column vectors means the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components is 1. Let the normalized eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $|C|^2 \\left( 1^2 + (\\tan(\\theta/2))^2 \\right) = 1$\n    $|C|^2 \\left( 1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2) \\right) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|C|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|C|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    We can choose the normalization constant $C$ to be real and positive, so $C = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (assuming $\\theta \\in (-\\pi, \\pi)$ so that $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is positive).\n    Now, substitute $C$ back to find the normalized eigenvector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\times 1 \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2) \\times \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
