    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is in the typical range for an ester (around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹) or an aromatic ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is highly likely.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons, such as a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons, which is the methyl group we just identified.\n    *   **Combined Analysis (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** These two signals together form a classic ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the methylene quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group that is part of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH₂ groups. This signal confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region:** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on a benzene ring, meaning it is disubstituted.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (d, doublet for each):** This symmetrical A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') pattern is characteristic of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The protons resonating at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (downfield), so they must be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The protons at 7.0 ppm are less deshielded (upfield), so they must be adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we have the following fragments:\n*   A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nCombining these pieces, the only possible structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group and the amine group are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern. Also, it's an amide, which has a different C=O stretch frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: correct formula, correct DoU, primary amine, ester carbonyl, ethyl ester group, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, so it would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl side (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) protons would resonate around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
