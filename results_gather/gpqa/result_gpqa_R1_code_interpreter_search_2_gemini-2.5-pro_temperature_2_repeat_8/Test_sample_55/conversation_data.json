    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom, from the state |n=3, l=0, m=0> down to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. The decay proceeds via an intermediate state through two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers of the initial state |n,l,m> and final state |n',l',m'> must satisfy the following rules:\n    *   **Δl = l' - l = ±1** (The orbital angular momentum must change by one unit).\n    *   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1** (The magnetic quantum number can change by at most one unit).\n    *   Δn is not restricted (n' can be any integer, but for decay/emission, energy must decrease, so n' < n).\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s):**\n    *   **First Transition:** from |3,0,0> to an intermediate state |n',l',m'>.\n        *   **Initial state:** n=3, l=0, m=0.\n        *   **Applying Δl = ±1:** l' - 0 = ±1, which means the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** m' - 0 = 0, ±1, which means the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n        *   **Applying n' < n:** For a decay, n' must be less than 3. A prominent intermediate state would be n'=2 (the 2p state), as this is the only state with l=1 and n<3. Therefore, the intermediate states must be of the form |2,1,m'>.\n        *   **Possible intermediate states:** |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** from the intermediate state |2,1,m'> to the final state |1,0,0>.\n        *   **Initial (intermediate) state:** n'=2, l'=1, m'={-1,0,1}.\n        *   **Final state:** n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0.\n        *   **Checking Δl:** Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the rule.\n        *   **Checking Δm:** Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be {-1, 0, 1}, which it is.\n        *   This confirms that transitions from all three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) to the final state |1,0,0> are allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n\n4.  **Identify the Possible Transition Routes:**\n    Based on the analysis, there are three possible complete decay routes:\n    *   **Route 1:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Route 2:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   **Route 3:** |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the rate of a specific transition divided by the total rate of all possible transitions from the initial state.\n    *   **Transition Rate:** The rate of a spontaneous E1 transition from an initial state |i> to a final state |f>, denoted Γ(i→f), is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: Γ(i→f) ∝ |⟨f| **r** |i⟩|², where **r** is the position operator.\n    *   **Branching Ratio (BR):** BR(|i> → |f>) = Γ(|i> → |f>) / Σ_k Γ(|i> → |k>), where the sum is over all possible final states |k>.\n    *   In our case, we need the probability of transitioning from |3,0,0> to a specific intermediate state, say |2,1,0>.\n        BR(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) / [Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) + Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>)]\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0). There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom must decay into the three m' sublevels of the l'=1 state with equal probability. The emitted radiation is isotropic and unpolarized.\n    *   **Conclusion from Symmetry:** This means Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0>→|2,1,1>).\n    *   **Calculating the Probability:** Let the rate for each transition be G. The total rate is G + G + G = 3G. The probability (branching ratio) for any one of these specific transitions is G / (3G) = 1/3.\n\n6.  **Final Step:**\n    Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'> states, it will decay to the |1,0,0> state. Since this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the 2p level, the probability of this second step is 1.\n    Therefore, the total probability for any of the three complete routes is simply the probability of the first step, which is 1/3.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. This option presents a valid route and the correct calculated probability.\n    *   D) ⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n\n<<<C>>>"
