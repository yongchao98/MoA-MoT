    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the two compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given 1H NMR data for the mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of each of the four possible compounds individually.\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They are meta to each other and will not split. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They are not adjacent and won't split each other. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a **second singlet** for **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives a **third singlet** for **3H**.\n    *   In total, the aliphatic region has three singlets with a 6:3:3 or **2:1:1** integration ratio.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent but are ortho to each other. They will couple and produce a complex signal (an AA' multiplet, which looks like a doublet of doublets or a more complex pattern), **not a singlet**.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 → C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, giving **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 groups will be split by the CH3 groups, and vice-versa. This results in a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**, not singlets.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum.\n\nThe crucial information is that the aromatic region shows **two singlets**. This immediately eliminates any option containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene), as it does not produce an aromatic singlet. Therefore, options B and D are incorrect.\n\nWe are left with options A and C.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.**\n    *   The aliphatic region of 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet. The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. This makes option A incorrect.\n    *   Also, in the aromatic region, a 1:1 mixture would give a singlet from the TMB (2H) and a singlet from the DEB (4H). The integration ratio would be 2:4 or 1:2, not 1:1 as observed.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**, assuming they have different chemical shifts. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet integrating to 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The combined spectrum is stated to have **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Let's analyze the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12 from the first compound + 12 from the second = 24 protons. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the three signals must integrate to:\n            *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24 = 12H\n            *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24 = 6H\n            *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24 = 6H\n        *   This can be explained if the signals from the mixture are:\n            1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n            2.  The 6H singlet from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n            3.  A 6H singlet resulting from the **accidental overlap** (degeneracy) of the two 3H singlets from the C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   This scenario is chemically plausible and is the only one that perfectly fits all the provided spectral data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
