    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify and Define the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\n    The problem asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which we'll denote as $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$, with a given transition energy $\\Delta E$. The paramagnetic coupling term describes the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment ($\\vec{\\mu}_L$) with an external magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$). The Hamiltonian for this interaction (the Zeeman effect for orbital motion) is:\n    $H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\n    The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum operator $\\vec{L}$ by:\n    $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -g_L \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L}$\n    where $g_L$ is the orbital g-factor (which is 1), $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. So, $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L}$.\n\n    Substituting this into the Hamiltonian:\n    $H = -(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L}) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\n    The problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to:\n    $H = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} L_z$\n    where $L_z$ is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator.\n\n    The energy contribution from this term, which is its expectation value $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$, is found by applying this operator to an atomic state $|n, l, m\\rangle$. The operator $L_z$ has eigenvalues $m\\hbar$:\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle n, l, m \\left| \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} L_z \\right| n, l, m \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar} (m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n    Here, $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\n    We are given:\n    *   Magnetic field strength, $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n    *   \"small values of $m$\". We can use $m=1$ for an order-of-magnitude calculation.\n\n    We will use the value of the Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$) in units that are convenient for this atomic physics problem, eV/T.\n    $\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\n    Now we calculate $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$:\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T})$\n    $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\n    The problem gives a transition wavelength $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series ($n_f=2$) transition from $n_i=4$ in the hydrogen atom. The energy of a photon with this wavelength is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. A useful value for the product $hc$ is:\n    $hc \\approx 1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}$\n\n    First, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n    $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\n    Now, calculate the energy $\\Delta E$:\n    $\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes**\n\n    Now we compare the two calculated energies:\n    *   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n    *   Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\n    To see the relationship clearly, we can compute their ratio:\n    $\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.551 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\n    Since the ratio is a very small number ($ \\sim 10^{-5} $), it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is very much smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\n    This result holds true in general for typical laboratory magnetic fields. The energy shifts due to the Zeeman effect are significantly smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic shells.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n\n    Based on the comparison, we conclude that:\n    $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n    The symbol \"$\\ll$\" means \"very much less than\".\n\nLet's present the values in a clear LaTeX format:\nParamagnetic coupling energy:\n$\n\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B = 1 \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}\n$\nTransition energy:\n$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}\n$\nComparison:\n$\n\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} \\quad \\ll \\quad \\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}\n$\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
