    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem relates the population of atomic energy levels in a star's photosphere to its temperature. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is key, as it allows us to use the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation describes the relative number of atoms in two different energy states (let's say an excited state `i` and the ground state `0`) as a function of temperature `T`:\n    `N_i / N_0 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N_i` and `N_0` are the number of atoms in the excited state and ground state, respectively.\n    *   `g_i` and `g_0` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states (`E_i - E_0`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply to Both Stars:** We can write this equation for both `star_1` (with temperature `T_1`) and `star_2` (with temperature `T_2`).\n    *   For star_1: `(N_i / N_0)_1 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2: `(N_i / N_0)_2 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** The problem states that the iron atoms in `star_1` are \"twice as excited\" as in `star_2`. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for `star_1` compared to `star_2`.\n    `(N_i / N_0)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_0)_2`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship from step 4:\n    `(g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:** The term for the statistical weights, `(g_i / g_0)`, is the same for both stars (since it's the same atomic transition) and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for Temperature:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides of the equation.\n    `ln( exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) )`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) )`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Rearrange the Equation:** Let's rearrange the terms to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values:** The problem provides the following values:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a physical constant, approximately `1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Now, calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    The value for `ΔE` was intentionally chosen to make this ratio equal to 1.\n\n10. **Final Equation:** Substitute `ΔE / k = 1` back into the equation from step 8:\n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    `[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\nThis result exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
