    "Here's my thinking process to solve this astronomy problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Star:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Peak Emission Wavelength:** The peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is related to its temperature (T) by Wien's Displacement Law: λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength (λ_emit). This shift depends on the source's radial velocity (v_r) relative to the observer. For a receding source (positive v_r), the light is redshifted (wavelength increases). For an approaching source, it's blueshifted. The observed wavelength is given by λ_obs = λ_emit * f(v_r/c), where c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n        *   L1 = 4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴\n        *   L2 = 4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴\n    *   The ratio L1 / L2 is:\n        (L1 / L2) = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)\n    *   The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\n        (L1 / L2) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states R1 = 1.5 * R2, so (R1/R2) = 1.5.\n    *   **Peak Wavelengths:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.\n    *   **Radial Velocities:**\n        *   v1 = 0 km/s (Star_1 is stationary relative to us).\n        *   v2 = 700 km/s (Star_2 is receding). The positive velocity implies recession and a redshift.\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** M1 = 1.5 * M2. This seems extraneous to the luminosity calculation based on radius and temperature and is likely a distractor.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):**\n    *   This is the core of the problem. We need to relate the temperatures using the fact that their observed peak wavelengths are equal.\n    *   **For Star_1:** Since v1 = 0, there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength.\n        *   λ_obs1 = λ_emit1\n        *   Using Wien's Law: λ_obs1 = b / T1\n    *   **For Star_2:** Since v2 = 700 km/s, its light is Doppler shifted. The velocity is much less than the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s), so the classical non-relativistic approximation is very accurate, but using the relativistic formula is more precise. Let's use the relativistic formula for the Doppler factor γ.\n        *   λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * γ = λ_emit2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n        *   Using Wien's Law: λ_obs2 = (b / T2) * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n    *   **Equating the Wavelengths:** Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2:\n        *   b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n    *   **Solving for the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):**\n        *   Cancel 'b' from both sides: 1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n        *   Rearrange the equation: T2 / T1 = sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n        *   Invert to get the required ratio: T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))\n\n6.  **Combine and Calculate:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        (L1 / L2) = (1.5)² * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴\n    *   The square root and the power of 4 simplify:\n        (L1 / L2) = 2.25 * [ (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) ]²\n    *   Now, it's time to plug in the values and compute the result. I will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\n# Ratio of radii (R1/R2)\nR_ratio = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2 = 700.0\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n\n# We need to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2.\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n\n# First, find the temperature ratio T1/T2.\n# The observed peak wavelengths are the same: lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2\n# For Star 1 (v1=0): lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 = b/T1\n# For Star 2 (v2 > 0): lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n# And lambda_emit2 = b/T2\n# So, b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n# This simplifies to: T2/T1 = sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))\n# Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))\n\n# Calculate the v/c ratio\nv_over_c = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio\nT_ratio = np.sqrt((1 - v_over_c) / (1 + v_over_c))\n\n# Now calculate the final luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R_ratio)^2 * (T_ratio)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * (T_ratio**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.22908359005953\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.22908.

    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 (L₁/L₂).\n\n### 2. Relevant Physical Laws\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black-body star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak wavelength (λ_emit) at which a black body emits most of its radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emit = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a source moving with a radial velocity (v) is related to its emitted wavelength (λ_emit) by:\n    λ_obs = λ_emit * √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive v indicates the source is moving away (redshift).\n\n### 3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio\n\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the ratio of luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nCanceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n### 4. Determine the Known Ratios\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂) = 1.5.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We need to find (T₁/T₂) using the information about their peak wavelengths.\n\n### 5. Find the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂)\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n\n*   **For Star 1:** It has a radial velocity v₁ = 0. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n    λ_obs₁ = λ_emit₁\n    Using Wien's Law: λ_obs₁ = b / T₁\n\n*   **For Star 2:** It has a radial velocity v₂ = 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted.\n    λ_obs₂ = λ_emit₂ * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n    Using Wien's Law: λ_emit₂ = b / T₂\n    So, λ_obs₂ = (b / T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n\n*   **Equating the Observed Wavelengths:**\n    λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂\n    b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n    1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n    T₂ / T₁ = √((1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c))\n    Inverting this gives the ratio we need:\n    T₁ / T₂ = √((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))\n\n### 6. Calculate the Final Result\n\nNow we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into our luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [√((1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c))]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [ (1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c) ]²\n\nUsing the provided code output which performed this calculation with:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c = 299792.458 km/s\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is **2.22908...**\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 2.229 rounds to **2.23**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
