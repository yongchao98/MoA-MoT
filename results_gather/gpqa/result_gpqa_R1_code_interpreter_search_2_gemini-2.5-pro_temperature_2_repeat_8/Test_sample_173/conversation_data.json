    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `p_initial` is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2` (fragment 1 is the more massive one).\n    *   The sum of their rest masses is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In this spontaneous fission, both total energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n**2. Calculate Rest Masses and Energy Release (Q-value)**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments in terms of the initial energy.\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n*   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n*   `2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis released energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   From `T = p^2 / (2m)`, we have `p^2 = 2m*T`.\n*   Applying this to both fragments: `p^2 = 2*m1*T1_class = 2*m2*T2_class`.\n*   This gives us the relationship: `m1 * T1_class = m2 * T2_class`.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations to find `T1_class`:\n1.  `T1_class + T2_class = Q = 3 GeV`\n2.  `m1 * T1_class = m2 * T2_class`\n\nFrom (2), `T2_class = (m1/m2) * T1_class`. Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T2_class = 2 * T1_class`.\nSubstitute this into (1):\n*   `T1_class + 2 * T1_class = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_class = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_class = 1 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the energy-momentum relation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding this gives: `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to a useful formula for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Applying the formula to both fragments and equating them:\n    `T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(m1*c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2*T2_rel*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe also know from conservation of energy that `T1_rel + T2_rel = Q = 3 GeV`, so `T2_rel = 3 - T1_rel`.\nSubstitute the values and the expression for `T2_rel` into the momentum equation:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `Q = 3 GeV`\n\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2*(3 - T1_rel)*(99)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = (9 - 6*T1_rel + T1_rel^2) + (198 - 198*T1_rel)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = T1_rel^2 - 204*T1_rel + 207`\nCancel `T1_rel^2` from both sides:\n`396*T1_rel = -204*T1_rel + 207`\n`396*T1_rel + 204*T1_rel = 207`\n`600*T1_rel = 207`\n`T1_rel = 207 / 600 = 0.345 GeV`\n\nWait, let's recheck the algebra. It seems I made an error.\n\nLet's re-solve `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`:\n`T1_rel * (T1_rel + 2*198) = (3 - T1_rel) * ( (3 - T1_rel) + 2*99 )`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = (3 - T1_rel) * (3 - T1_rel + 198)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = (3 - T1_rel) * (201 - T1_rel)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = 3*201 - 3*T1_rel - 201*T1_rel + T1_rel^2`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396*T1_rel = 603 - 204*T1_rel + T1_rel^2`\nCancel `T1_rel^2`:\n`396*T1_rel = 603 - 204*T1_rel`\n`396*T1_rel + 204*T1_rel = 603`\n`600 * T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\nThis result is correct. The previous calculation had a simple mistake (`207` instead of `603`).\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n\nNow we compare the relativistic and classical values for T1.\n*   Relativistic `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV`\n*   Classical `T1_class = 1.000 GeV`\n\nThe difference is:\n*   `ΔT1 = T1_rel - T1_class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>"
