    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In the solution, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   In the solution, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate).\n    *   The species H2PO4- and HPO4^2- form a buffer pair. H2PO4- is the weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = Mass of KH2PO4 / Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O / Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles of H2PO4- / Volume = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles of HPO4^2- / Volume = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which connects the buffer components:\n        H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n    *   Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Since both concentrations are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of moles:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * (moles of H2PO4- / moles of HPO4^2-)\n    *   The changes in the concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- upon reaching equilibrium are negligible because Ka2 is small, so we can use their initial concentrations.\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n    *   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n    *   Here, we use the equilibrium [H+] calculated from the buffer in step 4 and the equilibrium concentration of [HPO4^2-], which we can approximate by its initial concentration.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00          # Mass of KH2PO4 in g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09          # Molar mass of KH2PO4 in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00      # Mass of Na2HPO4*2H2O in g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99      # Molar mass of Na2HPO4*2H2O in g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate initial moles and concentrations ---\n# Moles of the acid component (H2PO4-)\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Moles of the base component (HPO4^2-)\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Concentration of the acid component\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n# Concentration of the base component\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer ---\n# From Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-], we get [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# We use the initial concentrations as a very good approximation.\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n# From Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-], we get [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# We use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- and the calculated [H+].\nPO4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / H_plus_conc)\n\n# --- Print the final result ---\nprint(f\"{PO4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n\n>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.24x10^-7 M for the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).

    "The provided Python script successfully calculated the concentration of the orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). The step-by-step logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles:** First, the moles of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) from KH₂PO₄ and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻) from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O were calculated.\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:** The molar concentrations of these ions were then found by dividing the moles by the solution volume (200.00 cm³ or 0.200 L).\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] ≈ 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] ≈ 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:** The ions H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ form a buffer solution. The [H⁺] is determined by the equilibrium associated with the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka₂:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    Rearranging gives: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    [H⁺] ≈ (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:** The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) concentration is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₃:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11x10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe code executed these steps and returned the result `6.24e-07`, which is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.
