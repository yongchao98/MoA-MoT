    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:** The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars. The total mass (M = M₁ + M₂) of such a system can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂). The relevant formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    (M₁ + M₂) sin³(i) = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n    where `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  **Simplify the formula based on observations:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\" binaries. For eclipses to be observable, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   If i ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   Therefore, we can simplify the mass equation to:\n        M₁ + M₂ ≈ [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n3.  **Express the total mass as a proportionality:** The term `1 / (2πG)` is a constant. Therefore, we can say that the total mass of the system is proportional to the product of its period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n4.  **Set up the ratio:** We need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n    Ratio = ( M_total_1 ) / ( M_total_2 ) = [P₁ * (K₁a + K₁b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂a + K₂b)³]\n    The constants of proportionality cancel out.\n\n5.  **List the given values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P₁ = 2 years\n        *   K₁a = 10 km/s\n        *   K₁b = 5 km/s\n        *   (K₁a + K₁b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P₂ = 1 year\n        *   K₂a = 15 km/s\n        *   K₂b = 10 km/s\n        *   (K₂a + K₂b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio:** Substitute the values into the ratio formula.\n    Ratio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n    Ratio = 2 * (15/25)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    Ratio = 54 / 125\n\n7.  **Compute the final value:** Perform the division to get the decimal value and compare it with the given options. This can be done with a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10 # km/s\nK1b = 5  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15 # km/s\nK2b = 10 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the total masses is given by (P1/P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)^3\n# This is because M_total is proportional to P * (K_total)^3 and the constants cancel out.\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\n> 실행 결과:\n>\n> 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432.

Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
