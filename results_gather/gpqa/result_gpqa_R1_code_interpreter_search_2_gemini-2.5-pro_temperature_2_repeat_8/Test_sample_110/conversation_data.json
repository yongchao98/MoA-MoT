    "**Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone that will be converted into an enolate.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at C6. The bulky t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate (nucleophile) attacks the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system.\n    *   For ethyl acrylate (CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt), the nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the CH₂ group.\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate. After this, the resulting enolate intermediate is protonated (likely by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) at the α-carbon to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   To name the product as per the options, we treat the cyclohexanone part as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The ester is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`. This means the cyclohexyl ring is attached to C3 of the `propyl` chain of the ester. The structure is `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂CH₂-COOEt`. This matches our derived product.\n    *   Now, let's name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the ring atom attached to the parent chain is numbered C1. The numbering then proceeds around the ring to give the principal functional group (the ketone's C=O) the lowest possible number.\n        *   Point of attachment (our old C6) is now **C1**. This carbon has a methyl group.\n        *   Numbering counter-clockwise, the C=O group (our old C1) is at **C2**. This is the lowest possible number for the oxo group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our old C2) is at **C3**.\n    *   So, the substituents on the cyclohexyl ring are:\n        *   A methyl group at C1 (`1-methyl`).\n        *   An oxo group at C2 (`2-oxo`).\n        *   An ethyl and a methyl group at C3 (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these, the substituent name is **`3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **`ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`**. This matches options A and B.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon alpha to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition of a nitroalkane.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (the CH₂) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion). The nucleophile is `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   In CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   The attack forms a new C-C bond, and subsequent protonation (by H₂O) of the resulting carbanion intermediate yields the final product.\n    *   Bond formation: `(CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂) + (CH₃CH-CH-CN) → CH₃CH₂(NO₂)CH - CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is a six-carbon chain. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon:\n        `N≡C(1) - C(2)H₂ - C(3)H(CH₃) - C(4)H(NO₂) - C(5)H₂ - C(6)H₃`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **`3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`**. This matches options B and D.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option B has both correct product structures.\n\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is correct, B is correct.\n*   C) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   D) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
