    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of various substituted benzene rings. The key is to determine the regioselectivity of the substitution, i.e., the relative yields of ortho, meta, and para isomers. The question asks to arrange the substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para-isomer*.\n\nThe weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction (since all monobrominated isomers of a given starting material have the same molar mass). Therefore, we need to rank the compounds based on the percentage of para-substitution.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify the substituents on the benzene ring based on their electronic effects, which determine their directing properties.\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive and directing the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃ (methyl):** Alkyl group, activating (via induction and hyperconjugation), ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅ (ethyl):** Alkyl group, activating (via induction and hyperconjugation), ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive and directing the incoming electrophile to the meta position. This is because the ortho and para positions are more strongly deactivated than the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅ (ethyl ester):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   4) **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** Halogens are a special case.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro):** Deactivating (due to strong inductive effect, -I), but ortho-, para-directing (due to resonance effect, +R).\n\n### **3. Order the Groups with Low Para Yield (Meta-Directors)**\n\nThe compounds with meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6) will produce the para-isomer as a very minor product. The more strongly deactivating the group, the more it destabilizes the intermediates for ortho and para attack, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to compare the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO₂ (4):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6) and -COOC₂H₅ (2):** Both contain a carbonyl group and are deactivating. The -COOH group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than the -COOC₂H₅ group. Therefore, the para-yield from benzoic acid will be lower than from ethyl benzoate.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### **4. Order the Groups with High Para Yield (Ortho-, Para-Directors)**\n\nThe compounds with ortho-, para-directing groups (1, 3, 5) will produce the para-isomer as a major product. The ratio of para to ortho product depends on a balance of steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The choice between the ortho and para positions is largely dictated by steric hindrance. The incoming electrophile (a bulky Br⁺-Lewis acid complex) will have an easier time attacking the less crowded para position. Since the ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃), ethylbenzene will give a higher proportion of the para-product compared to toluene.\n    *   Typical para yield: Toluene (~62%), Ethylbenzene (~66%).\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene)**.\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but ortho-, para-directing. Its strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect) deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more than the distant para position. The resonance donation (+R effect) activates both ortho and para positions. The net result is a very strong preference for substitution at the para position.\n    *   Typical para yield: Chlorobenzene (~87%).\n    *   This is a significantly higher para-selectivity than for the alkyl groups.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this subset is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### **5. Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para yields, followed by the ortho-, para-directors.\n\n*   Lowest para yields: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Highest para yields: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these two sequences gives the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
