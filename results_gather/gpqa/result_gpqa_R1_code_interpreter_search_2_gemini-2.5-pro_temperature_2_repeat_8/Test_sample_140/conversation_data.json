    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (sodium amide in liquid ammonia), which proceeds through a benzyne elimination-addition mechanism. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Starting Material:**\nThe starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This means we have a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 (C1) and a deuterium atom (D) at position 2 (C2). The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n\n**2. Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination Step):**\nThe reaction is initiated by the strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracting an acidic proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince both positions are ortho to the bromine, abstraction can occur from either C2 or C6, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H⁺) from C6:**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D⁺) from C2:**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. (Note: While abstraction of H is kinetically favored over D due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of D is still possible and leads to a valid product).\n    2.  This carbanion then eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates forming concurrently: 3-deutero-benzyne and benzyne.\n\n**3. Attack by Nucleophile (Addition Step):**\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates. The addition can occur at either carbon of the strained triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate A (3-deutero-benzyne):**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. This forms a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C6. This forms a carbanion at C1, which is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. The positional relationship is meta (position 3). This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    Pathway A produces two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n\n*   **Reaction of Intermediate B (benzyne):**\n    This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2, and no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. This forms a carbanion at C2, which is protonated by NH₃. The product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n    *   **Attack at C2:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C2. This forms a carbanion at C1, which is protonated. The product is also **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂).\n    Pathway B produces only one product: non-deuterated aniline.\n\n**4. Summary of All Possible Products:**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
