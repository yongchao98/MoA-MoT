    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $Ca^{2+}$, from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the chemical equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is described by the following equilibrium reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$), also given as KCa-EDTA, for this reaction is:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nIn this problem, we are starting with the product, the $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ complex, which will dissociate slightly to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation.

Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression for the formation constant, $K_f$:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n**4. Simplify and solve for x**\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complex form. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n$x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we can write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$.\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nLet's use a Python script to get a more precise value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\nC_complex = 0.02  # M\n\n# Formation constant\nKf = 5e10\n\n# From the simplified equation: Kf = C_complex / x^2\n# Solve for x^2\nx_squared = C_complex / Kf\n\n# Solve for x, which is the concentration of Ca2+\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that x = $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**5.

    "The problem involves calculating the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the dissociation equilibrium:** The initial solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex dissociates slightly into its constituent ions. The reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate to the given formation constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table for the dissociation:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species             | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the Kf expression:**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complexed form. This means the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\ M$\n\n    The code execution from the previous step confirms this calculation, giving a more precise value of $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Match with options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
