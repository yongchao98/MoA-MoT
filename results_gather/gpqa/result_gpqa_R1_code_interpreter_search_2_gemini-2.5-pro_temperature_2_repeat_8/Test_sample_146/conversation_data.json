    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes a particle annihilation event. A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and annihilate, creating four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\nThe fundamental principles we need to apply are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the reaction must equal the total momentum after the reaction.\n\n**2. Analyze the \"Before\" State (Initial State)**\n\n*   The problem states the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is \"slowly moving.\" In the context of particle physics, this means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate it as being at rest.\n*   It's standard in such problems to assume the target (the proton, $p$) is also at rest, as in a fixed-target experiment.\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since both the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    $P_{initial} \\approx 0$\n*   **Initial Energy:** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The kinetic energies are negligible.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}}$\n    A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass. The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Analyze the \"After\" State (Final State)**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. According to the problem, they all have the same mass, with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Final Momentum:** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. The four product particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n*   **Final Energy:** Because the initial momentum was zero, and all four product particles are identical in mass, they must share the available energy equally to conserve momentum. Therefore, all four particles will have the same speed ($v$) and the same total energy ($E_A$).\n    The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    The total energy of a single relativistic particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve for Velocity**\n\nNow, we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
