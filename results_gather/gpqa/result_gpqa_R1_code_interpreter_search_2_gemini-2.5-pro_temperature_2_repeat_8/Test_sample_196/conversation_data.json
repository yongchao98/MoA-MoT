    "*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Data Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid. The conjugation with an aromatic ring slightly lowers this frequency.\n        *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons adjacent (ortho) to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group). The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is due to protons adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives the fragment: -CH₂-CH₃.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This gives the fragment: -CH(CH₃)-.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the first fragment. It is adjacent to a -CH₃ (making the -CH₃ a triplet) and a -CH- (making it part of a complex multiplet).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift to ~2.9 ppm suggests it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). It is adjacent to a -CH₃ group and a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **Assembling the Structure:** Combining the fragments, we have a -CH- group attached to the ring, and this -CH- is bonded to both a -CH₃ group and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This is a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The molecule is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This is option (D), which is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to completely reduce a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 is an alkane group and will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n        *   Therefore, the product will be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product**\n\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n    Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl substituent is incorrect.\n    C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
