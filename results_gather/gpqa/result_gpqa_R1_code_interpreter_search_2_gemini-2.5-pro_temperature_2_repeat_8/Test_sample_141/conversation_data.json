    "An arbitrary density matrix for a single qubit can be written in the form:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere:\n-   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n-   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is a three-dimensional vector, known as the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state within the Bloch sphere.\n-   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$,\n    $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$,\n    $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 0\\right| + \\left|1\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 1\\right|)$\n\nIn the standard computational basis:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nNow we compare this result with the general form of the density matrix:\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nThis implies:\n$I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n$0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this equation holds true only if the coefficients are all zero:\n$r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0$\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nThis corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This state is known as the maximally mixed state, as it represents a uniform mixture of all possible pure states.\n\nAlternatively, the components of the Bloch vector can be calculated directly using the trace formula:\n$r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$\n\nFor our density matrix $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$:\n$r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n$r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n$r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$\n\nSo, the geometrical position is r = (0, 0, 0).\n\n<<<C>>>"
