    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of acid and base present in the initial solutions.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 moles\n\n2.  **Calculate moles of H+ from HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 moles\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.08 moles.\n\n3.  **Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates as Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Therefore, it produces 2 moles of OH⁻ ions per mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 moles = 0.18 moles.\n\nNext, we need to determine the result of the neutralization reactions. The reaction between the strong acid and the strong base will occur first.\n\n**Reaction 1: Neutralization of strong acid and strong base**\n*   The reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.08 moles\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 moles\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ are greater than the moles of H⁺, all the H⁺ from HCl will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 moles - 0.08 moles = 0.10 moles.\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n**Reaction 2: Neutralization of weak acid by the remaining strong base**\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 moles\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ (remaining from Reaction 1) = 0.10 moles\n*   Since the moles of OH⁻ are greater than the moles of CH₃COOH, all the acetic acid will be consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.05 moles\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH consumed = 0.05 moles\n*   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10 moles - 0.05 moles = 0.05 moles.\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.05 moles.\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, the final solution contains an excess of 0.05 moles of OH⁻, which is a strong base. The presence of the weak base CH₃COO⁻ is negligible compared to the strong base in determining the pH.\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total volume of the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pOH of the solution:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the solution:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo confirm the precise calculation, we can use Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\nmoles_H_strong = 0.2 * 0.4\nmoles_acid_weak = 0.1 * 0.5\nmoles_OH_strong = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2\ntotal_volume = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3\n\n# Neutralize strong acid and strong base\nmoles_OH_after_strong_acid_neutralization = moles_OH_strong - moles_H_strong\n\n# Neutralize weak acid with remaining strong base\nmoles_OH_final_excess = moles_OH_after_strong_acid_neutralization - moles_acid_weak\n\n# Calculate final [OH-], pOH, and pH\nif moles_OH_final_excess > 0:\n    concentration_OH = moles_OH_final_excess / total_volume\n    pOH = -math.log10(concentration_OH)\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    print(f\"The final pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\nelse:\n    # This case does not apply here, but included for completeness\n    # This would be the case if there were excess acid.\n    moles_H_final_excess = -moles_OH_final_excess\n    concentration_H = moles_H_final_excess / total_volume\n    pH = -math.log10(concentration_H)\n    print(f\"The final pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe calculation shows that the pH is 12.62.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 12.62\nC) 1.38\nD) 8.68\n\nThe calculated pH of 12.62 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This confirms the previous step-by-step reasoning.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of acids and base:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.300 L × 0.3 M × 2 = 0.18 mol\n\n2.  **Perform neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (HCl) reacts with the strong base (Ba(OH)₂).\n        *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n        *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n        *   OH⁻ is in excess. After reaction: Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) reacts with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n        *   Moles of CH₃COOH available = 0.05 mol\n        *   OH⁻ is still in excess. After reaction: Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The final solution contains an excess of 0.05 moles of strong base (OH⁻).\n    *   Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   Concentration of excess OH⁻ = [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe calculated pH matches the output from the code and option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
