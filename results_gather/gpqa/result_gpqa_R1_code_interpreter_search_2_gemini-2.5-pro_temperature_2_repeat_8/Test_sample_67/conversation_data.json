    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`):**\n    The spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n    Initially, it's in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the `+z` direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian `H_i = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_z`.\n    The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (assuming `γ > 0`), the spin must point in the `+z` direction, which corresponds to the lower energy state `E_up`.\n    Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (`t > 0`):**\n    At `t=0`, the z-field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+y` direction.\n    The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γB S_y`.\n    Here, `S_y` is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:**\n    The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩`.\n    To understand this evolution, it's easiest to express the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩` in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`. The eigenstates of `H` are the same as the eigenstates of `S_y`.\n\n4.  **Eigenstates of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    The operator `S_y` has eigenstates `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` respectively.\n    The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H = -γB S_y` are:\n    *   For `|+y⟩`: `E_{+y} = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   For `|-y⟩`: `E_{-y} = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n\n    In the `S_z` basis (where `|+z⟩ = (1, 0)` and `|-z⟩ = (0, 1)`), the `S_y` eigenstates are:\n    *   `|+y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)`\n    *   `|-y⟩ = (1/√2) (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)`\n\n5.  **Express Initial State in the New Basis:**\n    We need to write our initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩` as a combination of `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`. By adding the two equations above, we get:\n    `|+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = (2/√2)|+z⟩ = √2 |+z⟩`\n    So, `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`.\n    Our initial state is an equal superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new system.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time-Evolved State:**\n    Now we can apply the time evolution operator:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩) ]`\n    Since `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are energy eigenstates:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(-iE_{+y}t/ħ)|+y⟩ + exp(-iE_{-y}t/ħ)|-y⟩ ]`\n    Substituting the energy values:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y⟩ + exp(-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y⟩ ]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y⟩ + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y⟩ ]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We want the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\n    To calculate this, let's express `|ψ(t)⟩` back in the `S_z` basis:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2) (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + e^(-iγBt/2) (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z⟩ + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z⟩ ]`\n    Using Euler's formulas (`cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ 2cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + i(2isin(γBt/2))|-z⟩ ]`\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n\n    Now we calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (⟨+z|cos(γBt/2) - ⟨-z|sin(γBt/2)) S_z (cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩)`\n    Using `S_z|+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = (-ħ/2)|-z⟩`:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (⟨+z|cos(γBt/2) - ⟨-z|sin(γBt/2)) (cos(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|+z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)(ħ/2)|-z⟩)`\n    Due to orthogonality (`⟨z_i|z_j⟩ = δ_ij`):\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = cos²(γBt/2)(ħ/2) - sin²(γBt/2)(ħ/2)`\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt)`\n\n8.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    This is an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω`. The term is `cos(ωt)`, so by comparison, the angular frequency is:\n    `ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the magnetic field direction with the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The component perpendicular to the field (`S_z` in this case) oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
