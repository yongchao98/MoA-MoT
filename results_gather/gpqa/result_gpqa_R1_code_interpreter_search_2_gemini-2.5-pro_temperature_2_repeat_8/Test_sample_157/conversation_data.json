    "This question requires understanding the concept of a dominant-negative mutation in the context of protein dimerization and function.\n\n1.  **Analyze the wild-type protein's function:** The protein must form a dimer to become active. It has a dimerization domain specifically for this purpose. Once dimerized, it performs its function (gene transcription).\n\n2.  **Define a dominant-negative mutation:** A dominant-negative mutation occurs when a mutant protein not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. This happens in heterozygotes (individuals with one mutant and one normal allele). The overall result is a loss-of-function phenotype, even though a functional copy of the gene exists.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutation Y:**\n    *   It is located in the **dimerization domain**. This is a crucial piece of information.\n    *   It is **dominant-negative**. This means the mutant Y protein must interact with and inhibit the wild-type (WT) protein.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the possibilities:** How can a mutant protein with a defective dimerization domain interfere with the WT protein?\n    *   The cell produces both WT and Y protein subunits.\n    *   For the WT protein to work, it must find another WT protein to form a functional WT-WT dimer.\n    *   The mutant Y protein is present. Since its mutation is in the dimerization domain, its ability to interact with other subunits is altered. A dominant-negative effect implies that the Y subunit can still interact with the WT subunit, but this interaction is faulty.\n    *   Instead of forming a stable, functional WT-Y heterodimer (which is one possibility), a mutation in a domain responsible for specific protein-protein interaction (like dimerization) can often lead to misfolding and improper, non-specific interactions.\n    *   This can lead to **protein aggregation**, where the mutant protein acts as a \"seed,\" trapping both other mutant proteins and, crucially, the wild-type proteins into large, non-functional clumps.\n    *   By sequestering the WT protein into these aggregates, the Y protein prevents the formation of functional WT-WT dimers, effectively inhibiting the function of the wild-type allele. This results in an overall **loss-of-function phenotype**.\n\n5.  **Assess the given options:**\n    *   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation does not result in a wild-type phenotype; it results in a mutant (loss-of-function) phenotype.\n    *   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** If the mutant protein were simply degraded, it couldn't interfere with the wild-type protein. The remaining WT protein would form WT-WT dimers, likely resulting in a normal or near-normal (recessive) phenotype. The key to a dominant-negative effect is the *interference* by the mutant protein.\n    *   **C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** A dominant-negative mutation is a class of loss-of-function mutation, not gain-of-function.\n    *   **D) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** This is the most plausible mechanism. The mutation in the dimerization domain leads to improper interactions (aggregation), which sequesters and inactivates the wild-type protein. This perfectly explains the dominant-negative effect (interference) leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n<<<D>>>"
