    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle as the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the resulting circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nWhere:\n-   `I₀` is the central intensity.\n-   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n-   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n-   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, with `λ` being the wavelength of the light.\n-   `θ` is the angular position.\n\nThe minima of the diffraction pattern (dark rings) occur when the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is equal to zero (and the denominator is not zero).\n\nLet `x = k * a * sin(θ)`. The minima correspond to the values of `x` for which `J₁(x) = 0`. These are the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe first few positive zeros of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n-   First zero (j₁,₁): 3.8317\n-   Second zero (j₁,₂): 7.0156\n-   Third zero (j₁,₃): 10.1735\n\nThe angular position of the m-th minimum, `θ_m`, is given by the condition:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁,ₘ`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁,ₘ`\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, we get:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = j₁,ₘ`\n`θ_m = (j₁,ₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nAngular position of the first minimum (m=1):\n`θ₁ = (j₁,₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nAngular position of the second minimum (m=2):\n`θ₂ = (j₁,₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = [3.1839 / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\nNow we calculate the numerical coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\nfirst_zero = 3.8317\nsecond_zero = 7.0156\n\n# Calculate the difference in zeros\ndelta_zeros = second_zero - first_zero\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance\ncoefficient = delta_zeros / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n>>>0.507\n\nThe calculation yields a coefficient of approximately 0.507.\n\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.507 is closest to 0.506. The small difference is due to the precision of the Bessel function zeros used. More precise values are j₁,₁ ≈ 3.831706 and j₁,₂ ≈ 7.015587, which would give `(7.015587 - 3.831706) / (2π) ≈ 3.183881 / 6.283185 ≈ 0.5067`, which rounds to 0.507. Option A is the most accurate choice.\n\nIt is worth noting that the angular position of the *first* minimum itself is `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ/a)`, which corresponds to option D. This is a common distractor in such problems. However, the question asks for the distance between the first and second minima.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides, N, tends to infinity. The problem, therefore, is to find the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This is the classic case of Fraunhofer diffraction, which produces an Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity `I` of the diffraction pattern at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(x) / x]²`\nwhere `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, `λ` is the wavelength, 'a' is the radius of the aperture, and `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator term `J₁(x)` is zero (and the denominator `x` is not zero). We need to find the values of `x` for which `J₁(x) = 0`. These are the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nLet `x_m` be the m-th zero of `J₁(x)`. The angular position of the m-th minimum, `θ_m`, is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ` and using the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\n`θ_m = (x_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\nThis requires the first two zeros of `J₁(x)`:\n-   First zero, `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n-   Second zero, `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n-   First minimum: `θ₁ = (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n-   Second minimum: `θ₂ = (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (x₂ - x₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n\nLet's compute the coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`. Based on the python script executed previously, the value is:\n`coefficient = 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
