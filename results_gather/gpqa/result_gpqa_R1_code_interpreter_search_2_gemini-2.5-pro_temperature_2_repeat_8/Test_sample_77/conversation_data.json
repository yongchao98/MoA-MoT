    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Equations:** The scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` in the Lorentz gauge are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$ is the retarded time. This means the field observed at `(\\vec{r}, t)` was generated at `(\\vec{r'}, t_r)`.\n\n2.  **Point Charge Formulation:** For a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}(t')/dt'$.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Scalar Potential:** We substitute the charge density `\\rho` into the formula for `V`. The integration is tricky because the time `t_r` in the argument of `\\rho` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r'}`. The standard way to evaluate this integral is to introduce another integration over time `t'` with another delta function and then perform the spatial integral first.\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} \\delta(t' - t_r) d^3r' dt'$\n    Substituting $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c)) d^3r' dt'$\n    \n    First, we perform the integral over `d^3r'`. The delta function `\\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))` makes the integral pick the value at `\\vec{r'} = \\vec{s}(t')`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - t + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c) dt'$\n    \n    Let's use the problem's notation: `\\vec{d}(t') = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')` and `d(t') = |\\vec{d}(t')|`. The integral becomes:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q}{d(t')} \\delta(t' - t + d(t')/c) dt'$\n    \n    Now, we use the property of the delta function: $\\int g(x) \\delta(f(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{g(x_i)}{|f'(x_i)|}$, where $f(x_i)=0$.\n    Here, the function inside the delta is $f(t') = t' - t + d(t')/c$. The root $f(t')=0$ defines the retarded time `t_r`.\n    The derivative of `f(t')` is needed:\n    $f'(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'}(t' - t + d(t')/c) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{d(d(t'))}{dt'}$\n    \n    Let's compute the derivative of `d(t')`:\n    $\\frac{d(d(t'))}{dt'} = \\frac{d}{dt'}\\sqrt{\\vec{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{d}(t')} = \\frac{1}{2d(t')} (2 \\vec{d}(t') \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{d}(t')}{dt'}) = \\frac{\\vec{d}(t')}{d(t')} \\cdot (-\\vec{v}(t')) = -\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$\n    where `\\hat{d}(t') = \\vec{d}(t') / d(t')` and `\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}(t')/dt'`.\n    \n    So, $f'(t') = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')}{c}$.\n    \n    The integral is evaluated at `t' = t_r`, so we use `\\vec{d} = \\vec{d}(t_r)`, `d = d(t_r)`, and `\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)`.\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q/d}{|1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c|} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n    (The absolute value is dropped assuming `v < c`, which makes the denominator positive).\n    Substituting `\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    To match the format of the options, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Vector Potential:** The calculation for `\\vec{A}` is identical, except the numerator carries a factor of `q\\vec{v}` instead of just `q`.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    \n    Alternatively, one can use the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$.\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n    Using the identity $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, so $1/(\\epsilon_0 c) = \\mu_0 c$:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 c q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These exactly match the expressions in Option D.\n    *   Option A has a `+` sign in the denominator, which is incorrect. This would correspond to a non-standard definition of `\\vec{d}` or advanced potentials (which are typically excluded in such problems).\n    *   Options B and C are for a static charge or neglect retardation effects and incorrectly use `r` (distance from the origin) instead of `d` (distance from the retarded source position).\n\nTherefore, Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
