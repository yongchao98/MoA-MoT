    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the final product (Product 4)**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat -> Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4, heat -> Product 2**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + sodium cyanide (NaCN) -> Product 3**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).**\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess sodium hydride (NaH) + 1,5-dibromopentane -> Product 4**\n    *   This is a classic reaction sequence analogous to the malonic ester synthesis for forming a ring.\n    *   a) The protons on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic. The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        *   NCCH2COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    *   b) The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)₅Br → NCCH( (CH₂)₅Br )COOEt + Br⁻\n    *   c) Because excess NaH is used, the remaining proton on the alpha-carbon is also removed, forming a second carbanion.\n        *   NCCH( (CH₂)₅Br )COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NCC( (CH₂)₅Br )COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    *   d) This new carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.**\n\n    The structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon atom (C1) is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry and count the distinct hydrogen signals in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, we need to identify all the sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CN\n      |\n   (EtOOC)-C(1)\n          /  \\\n      H2C(6)  C(2)H2\n      |       |\n      H2C(5)  C(3)H2\n        \\   /\n         C(4)H2\n```\n(EtOOC = -COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nWe analyze the molecule under standard NMR conditions (room temperature), where rapid conformational changes (chair flips) and bond rotations occur.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to rapid rotation around the C1-COOEt bond and rapid chair-flipping, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane) that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   This plane of symmetry makes the left side of the ring (C6, C5) equivalent to the right side (C2, C3).\n    *   Therefore, C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   And C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** The carbon C1 is substituted with four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, the C2 part of the ring, and the C6 part of the ring), making it a prochiral center. This has a crucial consequence: the two geminal protons on any given methylene (-CH2-) group in the ring are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent.\n\nNow, let's count the signals:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total for ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). Because C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the protons on C6 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions (one signal for the two \"type A\" protons, one signal for the two \"type B\" protons).\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Because C3 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry, this results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons at these positions.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two geminal protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchanged by the plane of symmetry). Thus, they are chemically distinct and give **2 separate signals**.\n    *   *Total for cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of signals**\n\nTotal signals = (signals from ethyl group) + (signals from cyclohexane ring)\nTotal signals = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nThere will be a total of 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 12\nB) 10\nC) 8\nD) 5\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
