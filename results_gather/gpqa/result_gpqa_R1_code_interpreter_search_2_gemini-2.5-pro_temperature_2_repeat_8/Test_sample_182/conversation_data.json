    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Functional Groups:**\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) at position 1. This group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO) at position 2. This is an aldehyde group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2) at position 5. This group contains one carbon-carbon double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Initial IHD Calculation:**\nSumming up all contributions:\nIHD (starting material) = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (COOH C=O) + 1 (CHO C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**.\n\nWe can also determine the molecular formula to verify this.\n*   The structure has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). So, C=10.\n*   The hydrogens are C10H12.\n*   The oxygens are 3 (2 from COOH, 1 from CHO).\n*   Formula: C10H12O3.\n*   IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nThis confirms the initial IHD is 5.\n\n### **2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very potent reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristics are:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO), ketones (C=O), and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkanes (-CH3 or -CH2-).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds (Câ‰¡C) to single bonds (C-C), saturating the molecule.\n*   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and all pi bonds from the molecule, converting it into a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane). The carbon skeleton and any ring structures are typically preserved.\n\n### **3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\nApplying the reducing action of Red P/HI to our starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n*   The `-COOH` group is reduced to a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n*   The `-CHO` group is reduced to a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n*   The `-CH=CH2` (vinyl) group is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. The original 10-carbon skeleton is maintained, but now it's fully saturated. The final product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with the molecular formula **C10H20**.\n(A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would be C10H22. Forming one ring removes two hydrogens, leading to C10H20).\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The original molecule had one ring, and the reaction does not break it. So, the product has **1 ring**.\n*   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction reduces all double bonds (C=C and C=O) to single bonds. Therefore, the product has **0 pi bonds**.\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nAlternatively, using the molecular formula of the product (C10H20):\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = **1**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 5 (IHD of starting material)\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
