    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The problem involves finding the speed of light as measured by an observer in a laboratory frame, while the light is traveling through a moving medium (glass). This is a problem of relative motion that requires the principles of Special Relativity, specifically the relativistic velocity-addition formula. Classical (Galilean) velocity addition would simply give `v_lab = v_light_in_glass + v_glass = c/n + v`, which is incorrect at relativistic speeds.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:** To apply the velocity-addition formula, we need to define two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's frame of reference. We want to find the speed of light `u` in this frame.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass Frame):** This is the rest frame of the moving piece of glass. The glass is stationary in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`:** This is the velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S). The problem states the glass is moving at velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam. So, we take this as `+v`.\n    *   **`u'`:** This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the glass frame (S'). In its own rest frame, the speed of light in the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The formula is `u' = c/n`. The problem specifies to take the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, as 1. Therefore, `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is also positive.\n    *   **`u`:** This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory frame (S). This is the quantity we need to calculate.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** The formula for adding velocities along the same direction in Special Relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:** Now, we substitute the values we defined into the formula:\n    *   `u'` = 1/n\n    *   `v` = v\n    *   `c` = 1\n\n    This gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To simplify the complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    *   Numerator: `n * (1/n + v) = n/n + n*v = 1 + n*v`\n    *   Denominator: `n * (1 + v/n) = n*1 + n*v/n = n + v`\n    *   Combining these, we get:\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 1\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our derived result, `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
