    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Concepts**\n\nThis problem involves two key concepts from special relativity:\n*   **Relativistic Velocity Addition:** When speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c), we cannot simply add or subtract them. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative velocity between two objects.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a moving object is not just its kinetic energy but includes its rest mass energy. The formula for the total energy (E) of an object with rest mass (m₀) moving at speed (v) is `E = γ * m₀ * c²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n### **2. Define the Variables**\n\nLet's list the given information:\n*   Mass of the first astronaut, `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Mass of the second astronaut, `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, `v₂ = 0.5c`\nBoth astronauts are traveling in the same direction (positive x-direction).\n\n### **3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the speed of the first astronaut relative to the second astronaut (or vice-versa), we use the relativistic velocity addition/subtraction formula:\n\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n`E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for each astronaut.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n`γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v₁²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n\nThe energy of the first astronaut is:\n`E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n`γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v₂²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 1.1547`\n\nThe energy of the second astronaut is:\n`E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) * mc² = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc²`\n`E₂ ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Now, calculate the total energy:**\n\n`E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 2 * sqrt(3) * mc²`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) * mc²`\n`E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.4641) * mc²`\n`E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n### **5. Final Comparison**\n\n*   Calculated relative speed: `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Calculated total energy: `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
