    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its Products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the methoxy group.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar, so the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This attack creates two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n        2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one (C3) of their two chiral centers. By definition, they are **diastereomers**. Since the attack is on a molecule that is already chiral, the two diastereomers are not necessarily formed in a 1:1 ratio, but two distinct products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its Products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers and their relationships. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Because they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**. Let's check if this is a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The mirror image of (2R, 4S) is (2S, 4R). In this molecule, (2R, 4S) is superimposable on (2S, 4R). This means they are the same molecule, and it is a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** } These form a racemic pair.\n    3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol** (which is (2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R))\n\n    In total, there are three distinct stereoisomers produced in Reaction II.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture to be analyzed by HPLC contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n*   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers (let's call them D1 and D2).\n*   From Reaction II: One pair of enantiomers (E1 and E2) and one meso compound (M).\n    *   D1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   D2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   E1: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   E2: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   M: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. The stationary phase is achiral.\n*   **It can separate constitutional isomers** (like the products from Rxn I, C₇H₁₆O₂, and Rxn II, C₅H₁₂O₂). They will have very different retention times.\n*   **It can separate diastereomers** because diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity.\n*   **It cannot separate enantiomers** because enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. They will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n*   Let's count the separable groups in the mixture:\n    1.  Product D1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  Product D2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of D1) -> **1 peak**\n    3.  The racemic pair (E1 + E2): (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomers) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  Product M: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of E1 and E2) -> **1 peak**\n*   Total number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   **It can separate all stereoisomers**: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture should, in principle, give a separate peak.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  Product D1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  Product D2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    3.  Product E1: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  Product E2: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of E1) -> **1 peak**\n    5.  Product M: meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   Total number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
