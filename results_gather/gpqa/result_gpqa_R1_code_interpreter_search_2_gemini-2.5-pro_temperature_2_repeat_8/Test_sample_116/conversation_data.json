    "**1. Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to assess if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or the lack of any symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Some molecules, like substituted biphenyls, can be chiral without a chiral center due to restricted rotation, a phenomenon known as atropisomerism.\n\nLet's examine each molecule:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, which consists of two phenyl rings joined by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** All four positions *ortho* to the C-C bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are occupied by bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho substituents prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This steric hindrance locks the two phenyl rings in a non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality arising from hindered rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on Carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂CO, where a carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is only bonded to three groups (two carbons, one oxygen). The molecule possesses a two-fold rotational axis of symmetry (C₂) passing through the C=O bond. Furthermore, its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule through simple rotation. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar and has no chiral centers. It possesses a **center of inversion** (i) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
