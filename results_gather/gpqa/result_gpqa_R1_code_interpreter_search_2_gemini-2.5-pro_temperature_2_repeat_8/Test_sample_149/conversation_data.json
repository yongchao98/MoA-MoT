    "**1. Deciphering the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure of the initial compound using the provided molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. A carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 degree. This matches our calculated DoU of 5.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it's adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) (n+1 rule, 2 protons on the adjacent carbon -> 2+1=3 peaks). This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A signal for a two-proton methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's coupled to a single proton (n+1 rule, 1 proton on adjacent carbon -> 1+1=2 peaks). This proton is the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring (-C6H4-)\n    2.  An amino group (-NH2)\n    3.  An acetaldehyde fragment (-CH2CHO)\n    Putting them together, the structure must be 4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    Let's verify this structure, **(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**, against the data.\n    *   Formula: C8H9NO. (C6H4 from the ring + C2H3 from the side chain) + NH2 + O = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. (Matches)\n    *   NMR: All signals are perfectly explained by this structure.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, (4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    These are the reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is (4-(diazonium)phenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n    Structure: `[p-(+N2Cl-)-C6H4-CH2-CHO]`\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming gently results in a **hydrolysis** reaction (Sandmeyer-type reaction). The diazonium group, an excellent leaving group, is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Structure: `[p-(HO)-C6H4-CH2-CHO]`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is the set of conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** First, one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is deprotonated at the α-carbon by KOH to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product.\n        *   Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (A).\n\n        ```\n             OH      (4-hydroxyphenyl)\n             |       /\n        (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH--CH-CHO\n        ```\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol adduct. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic H from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This results in the formation of a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by conjugation of the new double bond with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings.\n\n        ```\n        Aldol Adduct (A)         -H2O (Heat)         Aldol Condensation Product (B)\n                                  ---------->\n        3-hydroxy-2,4-bis...                          2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n        ```\n\n        The structure of the final condensation product is:\n\n        ```\n                  (4-hydroxyphenyl)\n                  /\n        (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C-CHO\n        ```\n        This compound is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Identifying the Final Product**\n\nThe question asks for the final product. Given that \"Heat\" is specified in the reaction conditions for the aldol step, the reaction will not stop at the addition stage (product A). It will proceed to the more stable dehydrated condensation product (product B).\n\n*   Option A: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the intermediate aldol addition product.\n*   Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final aldol condensation product, formed after dehydration.\n*   Option C: Lacks the hydroxyl groups and has an incorrectly placed double bond.\n*   Option D: This is a product of a mixed-aldol condensation, which is not what happens here (it's a self-condensation).\n\nTherefore, the final product is the result of the full aldol condensation, which includes dehydration.\n\n<<<B>>>"
