    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. The Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_eff_star * [ (1 - A) * (R_star^2) / (4 * a^2) ]^(1/4)\nThis can be simplified to:\nT_eq = T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n*   T_eq1 = T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n*   T_eq2 = T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhen we take the ratio, the common terms will cancel out. The problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_eff_star and R_star are the same for both) and have the same albedo (A).\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_eff_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) / (R_star / (2 * a2)) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Parameters to Observational Data**\n\nWe are given the Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet's gravitational pull on the star. This is radial velocity (RV) data. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K_star) by the formula:\nΔλ / λ₀ = K_star / c  =>  K_star = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe star's radial velocity amplitude (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is also given by:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( (G * M_star) / a )\nNote: We assume the orbital inclination `i` is 90° (sin(i)=1), which is a reasonable assumption because the planets were also detected using the transit method, which requires an edge-on view. We also assume the planet's mass `M_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a2 / a1)**\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the `K_star` formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK_star² = (M_p / M_star)² * (G * M_star / a)\nK_star² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\nNow, let's form the ratio a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = [ (M_p2² * G) / (M_star * K_star2²) ] / [ (M_p1² * G) / (M_star * K_star1²) ]\n\nThe constants G and M_star cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K_star2²) / (M_p1² / K_star1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\nWe know that `K_star` is proportional to `Δλ` (since `c` and `λ₀` are constant). Therefore:\nK_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n**6. Substitute Values and Calculate**\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nCalculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nCalculate a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\n# M_p1 = 7 (in Earth masses)\n# M_p2 = 5 (in Earth masses)\n# delta_lambda_1 = 0.03 (in Angstroms)\n# delta_lambda_2 = 0.04 (in Angstroms)\n\n# Ratio of masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\ndoppler_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\n# a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)^2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio)**2 * (doppler_ratio)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\ntemp_ratio = a_ratio**0.5\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * [(1 - A) * (R_star^2) / (4 * a^2)]^(1/4)\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, most terms cancel out:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * ... * (1/√a1)] / [T_star * ... * (1/√a2)]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = √a2 / √a1 = √(a2 / a1)\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1, using the radial velocity data.\nThe maximum radial velocity (K) of the star caused by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\nwhere M_planet and M_star are the masses of the planet and star, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can solve for 'a':\nK^2 ≈ (M_planet^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (M_planet^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2/a1. The terms G and M_star are constant for both planets and will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [ (M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2) ] / [ (M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2) ]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nThe radial velocity K is related to the Doppler shift Δλ by the formula K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. Since c and λ_0 are the same for both measurements, K is directly proportional to Δλ.\nTherefore, (K_1 / K_2) = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for a2/a1:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^2\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value: 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357.\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
