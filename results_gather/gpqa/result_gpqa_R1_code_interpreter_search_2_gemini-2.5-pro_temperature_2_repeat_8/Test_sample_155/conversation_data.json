    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the mCPBA can attack from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides.\n        (E)-oct-4-ene -> (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane + (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This is a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs with inversion of stereochemistry and results in *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Let's trace the stereochemistry of the ring-opening for both enantiomers of the epoxide:\n    *   For (4R,5R)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion to S) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion to S) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two different names for the same *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a plane of symmetry.\n    *   For (4S,5S)-epoxide: Attack at C4 (inversion to R) gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion to R) gives (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Again, this produces the same *meso* compound.\n*   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A shortcut is to remember the rule: anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene yields a meso product.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺), resulting in anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** We can use the stereochemical shortcut: anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this step-by-step.\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** *Syn*-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene produces a cis-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric (two propyl groups), the resulting epoxide is a meso compound: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Ring-opening:** Acid-catalyzed opening of the meso-epoxide involves *anti*-attack by water.\n        *   Attack at C4 leads to inversion, resulting in one enantiomer, e.g., (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 leads to inversion, resulting in the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since the starting meso-epoxide and reagents are achiral, the two enantiomeric products are formed in equal amounts.\n*   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese compounds are related as follows:\n*   Compound 2 and 3 are enantiomers.\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of compound 2 and also a diastereomer of compound 3.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment. They will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n    *   Standard HPLC columns *can* distinguish between diastereomers, as diastereomers have different physical properties.\n    *   In the mixture, the meso-diol (1) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3). Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the pair.\n    *   The enantiomers (2 and 3) will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Result:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the stationary phase, forming transient diastereomeric complexes.\n    *   Since a chiral column can separate enantiomers, and it can also separate diastereomers, it will be able to resolve all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that there will be 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
