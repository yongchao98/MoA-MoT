    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the chemical shifts and integrations.**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H)**: This chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The integration of 1H means there is one proton responsible for this signal.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H)**: This is also in the vinylic region, corresponding to another single proton on the double bond.\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H)**: A chemical shift around 2.0-2.2 ppm for 3 protons is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H)**: A chemical shift in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond). The integration of 3H suggests a methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the splitting patterns (multiplicity).**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This proton is a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to (i.e., adjacent to) only one other non-equivalent proton. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) is a critical piece of information. For vinylic protons, a J-value in the range of 12-18 Hz indicates a *trans* relationship, while a J-value in the range of 6-12 Hz indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a *trans* configuration.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (dq)**: This proton is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, d) and a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group, giving the quartet, q).\n    *   **2.1 ppm (s)**: This signal is a singlet (s), meaning these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with. This confirms the presence of an isolated acetate methyl group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (d)**: These three protons form a doublet (d), meaning they are coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond, which is coupled to the proton on the adjacent vinylic carbon (CH₃-CH=).\n\n*   **Step 3: Assemble the structure and check for consistency.**\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n        1.  An acetate group: -O-C(=O)-CH₃ (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n        2.  A trans-substituted double bond: -CH=CH- (from the two vinylic signals at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm, with J = 16.0 Hz).\n        3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: CH₃-CH= (from the 1.6 ppm doublet and the quartet splitting in the 5.5 ppm signal).\n\n    *   Let's assemble these pieces: CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. This is the structure for propenyl acetate. The structure of butenyl acetate (e.g., CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃) is inconsistent with the data because it would have a -CH₂- group signal which is absent.\n\n    *   Now, let's assign the protons in **Trans-propenyl acetate** to the signals:\n        *   `CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n        *   **H(d) (acetate methyl)**: These are the 3 protons at **2.1 ppm (s)**. They are isolated, hence a singlet.\n        *   **H(c) (allylic methyl)**: These are the 3 protons at **1.6 ppm (d)**. They are coupled to one proton, H(b), hence a doublet.\n        *   **H(b) (vinylic proton)**: This is the proton at **5.5 ppm (dq)**. It's coupled to one proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons H(c) (giving a quartet).\n        *   **H(a) (vinylic proton)**: This is the proton at **7.0 ppm (d)**. It is coupled to one proton, H(b), hence a doublet. It is shifted far downfield because it is directly attached to the deshielding oxygen atom of the ester group. The coupling constant between H(a) and H(b) is **J = 16.0 Hz**, confirming the *trans* geometry.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n    *   The identified structure is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n    *   A) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect carbon chain and stereochemistry.\n    *   B) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect stereochemistry (would have a smaller J-value).\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: Matches the data perfectly.\n    *   D) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect carbon chain.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
