    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options suggest the starting materials are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's break down this name and draw the structure.\n    *   \"Pentanoic acid\" indicates a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1.\n    *   \"-5-oxo-\" and \"-5-isobutoxy\" implies that the C5 is also a carbonyl carbon, part of an ester with an isobutyl group. The parent compound is 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (or 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    *   The structure is an ester-acid: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-CH2CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   There is a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group. Therefore, the starting material can exist as either an (R) or (S) enantiomer.\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is \"4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\".\n    *   This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a lactone).\n    *   The ring contains one oxygen atom (tetrahydropyran). The carbonyl group is at position 2.\n    *   An ethyl group is at position 4. This C4 is the chiral center of the product.\n    *   The reactions produce specific stereoisomers, either (R) or (S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is more selective than LiAlH4. When faced with both an ester and a carboxylic acid in the same molecule, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester** to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` (Compound A) is treated with LiBH4. The ester group at C5 is reduced.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --LiBH4--> HOOC-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n        The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group (-OH) at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1, eliminating a water molecule and forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction at C5, lactonization at C1/C5) do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the groups around C3 is unchanged. However, the name of the configuration (R/S) depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents. We must analyze if the priorities change.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH2COOiBu` (P1)\n        2.  `-CH2COOH` (P2)\n        3.  `-CH2CH3` (P3)\n        4.  `-H` (P4)\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** The chiral center is now C4. The groups are:\n        1.  The ring path toward the carbonyl group (`-C3-C2(=O)-...`) (P'1)\n        2.  The ring path toward the ether oxygen (`-C5-C6-O-...`) (P'2)\n        3.  `-CH2CH3` (P'3)\n        4.  `-H` (P'4)\n    *   **Mapping the Groups:**\n        *   The `-CH2COOH` group (P2) in the starting material becomes the carbonyl part of the lactone ring. This corresponds to the highest priority group (`P'1`) in the product. So, `P2 -> P'1`.\n        *   The `-CH2COOiBu` group (P1) is reduced and becomes the ether part of the ring. This corresponds to the second priority group (`P'2`) in the product. So, `P1 -> P'2`.\n        *   The ethyl group (P3) remains unchanged (P3 -> P'3).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priority of the top two groups is swapped (P1 becomes P'2, and P2 becomes P'1). A swap of two groups inverts the stereochemical descriptor. Therefore, an (S)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (R)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n*   **Result for Reaction 1:** The reaction produces the **(R)**-lactone. This means the starting material A must have had the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH3) is a highly selective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly. Thus, BH3 will preferentially reduce the -COOH group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu` (Compound B) is treated with BH3. The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced.\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu --BH3--> HOCH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-COO-iBu`\n        The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group (-OH at C1) attacks the ester carbonyl (C5), eliminating isobutanol and forming the lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction does not affect the chiral center C3 directly. We check the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as before: (P1) `-CH2COOiBu`, (P2) `-CH2COOH`, (P3) `-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Priorities in Product:** Same as before: (P'1) `-ring(C=O)`, (P'2) `-ring(O)`, (P'3) `-Et`.\n    *   **Mapping the Groups:**\n        *   The `-CH2COOiBu` group (P1) becomes the carbonyl part of the lactone. This corresponds to the highest priority group (`P'1`) in the product. So, `P1 -> P'1`.\n        *   The `-CH2COOH` group (P2) is reduced and becomes the ether part of the ring. This corresponds to the second priority group (`P'2`) in the product. So, `P2 -> P'2`.\n        *   The ethyl group (P3) remains unchanged (P3 -> P'3).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center is preserved (`P1 -> P'1`, `P2 -> P'2`). Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is retained. An (S)-starting material gives an (S)-product, and an (R)-starting material gives an (R)-product.\n*   **Result for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces the **(S)**-lactone. This means the starting material B must have had the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
