    "*   **Analyze the Context:** The conversation takes place between two chemists in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. This context is crucial. In this setting, chemists routinely perform chemical reactions to create new compounds and then must isolate and purify their desired product from a mixture containing starting materials, byproducts, and reagents.\n\n*   **Deconstruct the Phrase:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common piece of lab jargon. It implies a failure to separate two or more substances during an analysis or purification step. We need to think about the most common separation techniques where this visual metaphor would apply.\n\n*   **Evaluate Common Techniques and the Phrase's Fit:**\n    *   **Chromatography (Thin-Layer and Column):** This is the most common method for purifying reaction mixtures in a synthetic lab. In thin-layer chromatography (TLC), which is used to monitor reactions and determine separation conditions, compounds appear as spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the TLC plate at almost the same rate, and their spots will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other.\" In column chromatography, the same principle applies; compounds with similar polarities will elute from the column at the same time (co-elute), making them inseparable. The separation in normal-phase chromatography is based almost entirely on the polarity of the compounds. This is a perfect match for the phrase.\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates compounds based on boiling point. While compounds with similar boiling points would be difficult to separate, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is less commonly used to describe this situation. A chemist might say \"they're co-distilling\" or \"their boiling points are too close.\"\n    *   **Optical Rotation:** This is a property of chiral molecules measured with a polarimeter, not a separation technique. While enantiomers (mirror-image isomers) are notoriously difficult to separate, this phrase doesn't describe the measurement of their optical rotation.\n    *   **Non-covalent Interactions:** These interactions (like van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding) are the fundamental basis for how chromatography works. The problem isn't that the molecules are interacting with each other, but that their *net interactions* with the stationary phase (like silica gel) and mobile phase (the solvent) are too similar, leading to a lack of separation. Therefore, similar polarity is the direct cause of the separation problem.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" most directly and commonly refers to the result of a failed chromatographic separation (like TLC or column chromatography). This failure occurs when the compounds in the mixture have very similar polarities, causing them to move through the chromatography system together instead of separating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
