    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a complex many-body problem (a probe interacting with a nucleus of many nucleons) into a much simpler one-body problem. The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that the interaction is very short and imparts a large momentum transfer (an impulse) to a single nucleon. During this extremely brief moment, we can \"freeze\" the state of the nucleus and treat the struck nucleon as if it were a free particle, ignoring the complicated forces that normally bind it to the other nucleons.\n\nNow let's analyze the four proposed assumptions:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is the fundamental starting point. To reduce a many-body problem to a one-body problem, we must assume that the incoming probe interacts with just one constituent at a time. If the probe interacted with pairs of nucleons or the nucleus as a whole (which can happen via so-called \"meson-exchange currents\" or collective excitations), the impulse approximation would not be valid. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption addresses what happens before and after the main interaction. It means that the incoming probe particle is not scattered by other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon, and, just as importantly, the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the rest of the nucleus on their way out. These secondary interactions are called \"final-state interactions\" (FSIs). While more sophisticated models (like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation) try to account for FSIs, the simplest and most basic version of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation) assumes they are negligible. Therefore, this \"transparency\" is a key simplifying assumption. This assumption is **essential** for the simplest form of the approximation.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This assumption deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself (i.e., its composition of quarks and gluons). The impulse approximation, however, is a model of how *nucleons* behave within a *nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle of interest. Whether the quarks inside it are relativistic or not is a separate question relevant to different energy scales and models of the nucleon itself (like the Quark Model). The impulse approximation can be used in regimes where quarks are certainly relativistic (e.g., deep inelastic scattering). Therefore, this is **not a defining assumption** of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the heart of the \"free nucleon\" concept. A nucleon in a nucleus is bound by the strong nuclear force, which means it has a binding energy and its momentum is constrained. This assumption states that the interaction happens so quickly that the binding forces from neighboring nucleons are irrelevant *during the interaction*. The nucleon is effectively \"quasi-free\" at the moment it is struck. This allows physicists to use the well-understood interaction properties (cross sections) of free nucleons in their calculations. This assumption is **essential**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe three essential assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n*   **Assumption 1** isolates the interaction to a single nucleon.\n*   **Assumption 4** treats that nucleon as free from binding forces during the interaction.\n*   **Assumption 2** ensures that the \"before\" and \"after\" picture is clean, without complicating secondary interactions.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
