    "The user wants to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\nWe have a central metal ion, Co²⁺, which reacts with the thiocyanate ligand, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes. The equilibria are governed by the overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe relevant species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ion\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (the species of interest)\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the following equilibria and their corresponding overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Expression for the Mole Fraction**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction α₂ is the concentration of the complex divided by the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. Since the ligand concentration is ten times higher than the metal concentration, the amount of ligand that gets bound in the complexes is relatively small compared to its total amount. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻], with the total ligand concentration.\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂)**\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation for α₂:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate each term in the denominator polynomial (let L = [SCN⁻]):\n*   β₁L = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nThe numerator is the term for the desired complex:\nNumerator = β₂L² = 0.4\n\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**5. Convert to Percentage**\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] concentration in M\n\n# Numerator of the mole fraction alpha_2\nnumerator_a2 = b2 * L**2\n\n# Denominator is the sum of all terms in the distribution polynomial\n# Terms are for Co(0), Co(1), Co(2), Co(3), Co(4) complexes\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = b1 * L\nterm2 = b2 * L**2\nterm3 = b3 * L**3\nterm4 = b4 * L**4\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator_a2 / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN-).\n\n**1. Identify the species and equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with the thiocyanate ligand (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The species present in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺;     β₁ = `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])` = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂];     β₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)` = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻;   β₃ = `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)` = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻;   β₄ = `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)` = 16\n\n**2. Define the Mole Fraction**\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, which is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This is also known as the mole fraction (α₂) of the species, expressed as a percentage.\n`Percentage = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\n**3. Express Concentrations in Common Terms**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants β:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Derive the Formula for the Mole Fraction (α₂)**\n\nNow we can write the formula for the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Approximate Ligand Concentration and Calculate**\n\nThe total concentration of the ligand `[SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M` is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal `c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`. Because the ligand is in large excess, the amount that binds to the cobalt will be small compared to the total amount. Therefore, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as equal to its total concentration:\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation for α₂:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   1\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of the denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
