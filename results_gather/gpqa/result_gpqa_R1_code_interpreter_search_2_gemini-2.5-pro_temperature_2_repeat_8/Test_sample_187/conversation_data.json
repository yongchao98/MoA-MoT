    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Given Parameters:**\n    The problem specifies a rhombohedral crystal.\n    The given parameters are:\n    *   Lattice parameter `a` (interatomic distance) = 10 Angstrom. In a rhombohedral system, `a = b = c`.\n    *   Interfacial angles `α = β = γ` = 30°.\n    *   The plane of interest is the (hkl) = (111) plane.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Spacing (d-spacing):**\n    The general formula for the interplanar spacing `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n    `1/d_hkl² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n\n3.  **Simplify the Formula for the (111) Plane:**\n    For the specific case of the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, and `l = 1`.\n    Let's substitute these into the formula:\n    *   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n    *   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `1/d_111² = [ 3sin²α + 2(3)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n    `1/d_111² = [ 3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]`\n\n    Now, we can simplify the numerator and denominator.\n    *   **Numerator:** `3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα = 3(sin²α + cos²α) + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1) + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α) = 3(1 - cosα)²`.\n    *   **Denominator:** The term `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)` can be factored as `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\n    Substituting these simplified forms back into the equation:\n    `1/d_111² = [ 3(1 - cosα)² ] / [ a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\n    The `(1 - cosα)²` terms cancel out, leaving a much simpler formula for the (111) plane:\n    `1/d_111² = 3 / [ a²(1 + 2cosα) ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Value:**\n    Now we can plug in the given values: `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`.\n    *   `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n    `1/d_111² = 3 / [ 10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)) ]`\n    `1/d_111² = 3 / [ 100 * (1 + √3) ]`\n\n    To find `d_111`, we invert the equation and take the square root:\n    `d_111² = [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3`\n    `d_111 = sqrt( [ 100 * (1 + √3) ] / 3 )`\n    `d_111 = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3) / 3 )`\n\n    To get a numerical value, we will perform the calculation using a Python script for high precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for use in math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Get the cosine of the angle\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Use the simplified formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal:\n# 1/d^2 = 3 / (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha)))\n# Therefore, d^2 = (a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3\n# And d = sqrt((a^2 * (1 + 2*cos(alpha))) / 3)\n\nd_squared = (a**2 * (1 + 2 * cos_alpha)) / 3\nd_111 = math.sqrt(d_squared)\n\nprint(d_111)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   B) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   D) 8.95 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated result `d_111 ≈ 9.54` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python code was executed successfully, and the output confirms the calculation.\n\n1.  **Initial Formula:** The interplanar spacing `d` for a rhombohedral system is given by `1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]`.\n2.  **Simplified Formula for (111) Plane:** For the (111) plane, this formula simplifies to `d₁₁₁ = a * √[(1 + 2cosα) / 3]`.\n3.  **Calculation:** With the given values `a = 10` Angstrom and `α = 30°`, the calculation is:\n    `d₁₁₁ = 10 * √[(1 + 2cos(30°)) / 3]`\n    `d₁₁₁ = 10 * √[(1 + 2 * (√3/2)) / 3]`\n    `d₁₁₁ = 10 * √[(1 + √3) / 3]`\n4.  **Numerical Result:** The Python code calculated this value to be approximately `9.54297` Angstrom.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is `9.54` Angstrom, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
