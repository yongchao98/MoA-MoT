    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two isomers (tautomers) are in dynamic equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and the shifting of a pi bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Let's examine the carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups. For the C=O at position 1, the alpha-carbons are at positions 2 and 6. For the C=O at position 3, the alpha-carbons are at 2 and 4. For the C=O at position 5, the alpha-carbons are at 4 and 6.\n    *   All these alpha-carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp³ hybridized and each carries two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Because there are alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   In fact, its enol tautomer is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable. The equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n    *   Let's examine the carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups. For the C=O at position 1, the alpha-carbons are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bond system (C2=C3 and C5=C6). They are sp² hybridized.\n    *   Standard keto-enol tautomerism requires the alpha-carbon to be sp³ hybridized to allow for the easy removal of a proton and the formation of a new double bond. In benzoquinone, all alpha-carbons are sp² hybridized. There are no sp³ hybridized alpha-carbons with alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   Therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism. The conversion to its corresponding di-hydroxy form (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction (addition of H₂), not a tautomeric interconversion.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, (A) is benzoquinone.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Chiral molecules exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an ester of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. It possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=C bond. It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Additionally, there are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. So, (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
