    "*   **Analyze the options in the context of high-energy physics:** The question asks about regularization at \"high energies.\" This phrase strongly points towards the ultraviolet (UV) divergences that appear in quantum field theory (QFT) calculations, specifically in loop diagrams that represent virtual particle-antiparticle pair creation. Regularization is the procedure used to make these mathematically divergent integrals finite so they can be dealt with.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong force. Like other interacting QFTs, calculations of physical quantities (like scattering cross-sections) using perturbation theory involve loop diagrams. These loop integrals diverge at high momentum (high energy). Therefore, QCD **requires regularization** followed by renormalization to yield finite, physical predictions.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force. It was the first QFT where the techniques of regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to tame UV divergences found in loop calculations (e.g., the electron self-energy). Therefore, QED **requires regularization**.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is governed by Maxwell's equations. It is a *classical* theory, not a quantum one. It does not have the concept of loop diagrams or virtual particles that lead to the UV divergences characteristic of QFT. While it does suffer from its own divergence issue—the infinite self-energy of an ideal point charge—the specific techniques and the reason for regularization in the QFT context (taming loop integrals) do not apply. The classical problem is typically seen as a hint that the theory is incomplete and must be replaced by a quantum theory (like QED) at short distances. However, one could argue that introducing a finite radius for a charged particle to make its self-energy finite is a form of classical regularization.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a candidate for a quantum theory of everything, including gravity. A primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be a \"UV-finite\" theory. Unlike point particles in QFT, strings are one-dimensional, extended objects. When they interact, the interaction is \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to UV divergences in QFT. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to yield finite results without the need for an ad-hoc regularization procedure. It is conjectured to be a fundamentally well-behaved theory at high energies.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the quantum theories listed (A, B, C), QED and QCD both definitively require regularization. Superstring Theory is specifically proposed as a theory that is UV-finite and thus does not require regularization. While Classical Electrodynamics doesn't require regularization *in the same way as QFT*, Superstring Theory is the better answer because it's a quantum theory designed to operate at high energies precisely to *solve* the divergence problem that makes regularization necessary in other quantum theories. It \"never requires\" regularization because its fundamental structure is believed to prevent the infinities from appearing in the first place.\n\n<<<B>>>"
