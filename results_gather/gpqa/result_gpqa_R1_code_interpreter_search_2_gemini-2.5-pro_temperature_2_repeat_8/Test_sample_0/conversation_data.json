    "This problem is about the relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy, which is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle to use here is the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n*   **Applying the Principle:** The lifetime of an excited state (τ) can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the inherent uncertainty in the energy of a state, also known as its natural linewidth, is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels (or spectral lines) to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their central energies (E_diff = |E1 - E2|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). A common and slightly less strict criterion is that the energy difference must be significantly larger than the larger of the two energy uncertainties. Let's calculate the uncertainties for both states.\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The energy width of the first level is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The energy width of the second level is ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The total \"blur\" is dominated by the broader line, which is ΔE₁. To resolve the two levels, their energy separation must be larger than this blur. So, we need:\n        |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n        |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Comparing with the options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only the energy difference in option D is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\n# Delta_E = hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nFor the energy levels to be resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be larger than the linewidths.\")\nprint(f\"The larger linewidth is ΔE1 = {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(\"Comparing this to the options:\")\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is greater than ΔE1. This could be resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is not greater than ΔE1. This could not be resolved.\")\n```\n\n**2. Final Answer:**\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. The lifetime (τ) of a state is related to the uncertainty in its energy (its \"linewidth,\" ΔE) by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" their energy difference, ΔE_levels = |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the individual energy uncertainties (linewidths) of the states. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty and will therefore be the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy uncertainty is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ/τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy uncertainty is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ/τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    The broader of the two energy levels is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. For the levels to be distinguishable, their energy separation must be significantly larger than this value. So we need |E1 - E2| >> 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV << 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference substantially larger than the energy width of the broader state, allowing the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
