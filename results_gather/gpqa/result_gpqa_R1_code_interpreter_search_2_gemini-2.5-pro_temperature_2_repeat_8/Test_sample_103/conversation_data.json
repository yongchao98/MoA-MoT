    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principles**\n    The problem involves the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity relative to us.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Doppler shift formula for light is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the source, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The problem mentions a \"periodic shift of up to X miliangstrom\". This maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude, or simply $K$.\n    Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    For planet #1: $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    For planet #2: $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between RV Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (P)**\n    The formula for the RV amplitude $K$ for a planet of mass $M_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_{star}$ in a circular orbit with period $P$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Parameters for the Two Systems**\n    We are given the following information:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\": $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\": $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n    *   The problem does not specify the orbital inclinations ($i$). In such problems, it's a standard assumption that either the inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$) or that they can be neglected for the ratio calculation.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\n5.  **Establish the Proportionality**\n    Given that $M_{star}$, $M_p$, and $\\sin i$ are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a proportionality between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio Equation**\n    We can write the relationship for the two systems as:\n    $K_1 \\propto P_1^{-1/3}$\n    $K_2 \\propto P_2^{-1/3}$\n    Taking the ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n    We need to find $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    Inverting both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n8.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate**\n    We know that $K_1/K_2 = 5/7$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n    Now, let's compute the decimal value.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1 is equal to (K1/K2)^3.\n# K1 corresponds to a 5 miliangstrom shift.\n# K2 corresponds to a 7 miliangstrom shift.\nratio_K1_over_K2 = 5 / 7\nratio_P2_over_P1 = ratio_K1_over_K2**3\nprint(ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.\n\n9.  **Conclusion**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$).\n\n1.  **Relating observables to physical quantities**: The radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic shift in a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$.\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom, so we can say $K_1 \\propto 5$.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom, so we can say $K_2 \\propto 7$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n2.  **The RV semi-amplitude formula**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplifying for the given problem**: We are told that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($M_{p,1} \\approx M_{p,2}$).\n    *   As no information is given about the inclination angles, we assume they are similar ($\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$), which is a common simplifying assumption in such problems.\n    \n    Given these conditions, all terms in the equation except $K$ and $P$ are approximately constant for both systems. Thus, we can establish a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Solving for the period ratio**: We can write the relationship for the two systems as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation by cubing both sides:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}$\n\n5.  **Calculation**: Now, we substitute the known ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    Calculating the decimal value:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
