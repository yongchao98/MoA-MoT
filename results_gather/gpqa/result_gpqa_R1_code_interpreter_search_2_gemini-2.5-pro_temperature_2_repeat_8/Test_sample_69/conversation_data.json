    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   (1) `A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    *   (2) `C + 2 D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    *   (3) `C + H₂O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   (4) `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio)\n    *   Goal: Find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) D∞h, B) D4h, C) C2, D) C2v.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue (3): The Hydrolysis Reaction.**\n    `C + H₂O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    This is the most chemically informative clue. The formation of two different acids, one strong and one weak, from the hydrolysis of a single precursor C strongly suggests the involvement of an element that can form multiple oxoacids. A classic example is Nitrogen, which forms the strong acid HNO₃ (nitric acid) and the weak acid HNO₂ (nitrous acid). This often occurs via disproportionation of an intermediate oxidation state. The regeneration of A as a solid suggests A is a chemical element, likely a metal, that is oxidized to form C and then reduced back to its elemental form A(s) upon hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Identify B, F, and G.**\n    Based on step 2, we can hypothesize:\n    *   **F = HNO₃** (strong acid)\n    *   **G = HNO₂** (weak acid)\n    These acids would be formed from a nitrogen-containing species. The most likely candidate for the gaseous reactant B is a nitrogen oxide. **NO₂** (Nitrogen dioxide, N is in the +4 oxidation state) fits well because it is a gas and its chemistry often involves disproportionation to N(+5) (in HNO₃) and N(+3) (in HNO₂).\n    *   Therefore, let's tentatively identify **B = NO₂(g)**.\n\n4.  **Identify D and H using Clue (4).**\n    `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    Substituting B = NO₂, the reaction is `D(g) + NO₂(g) -> H(solvent)`.\n    We need a 1:1 reaction between a gas D and NO₂ to form a liquid solvent H. A well-known reaction in nitrogen chemistry is:\n    `NO(g) + NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₃(l)`\n    *   **D = NO** (Nitric oxide), which is a gas.\n    *   **H = N₂O₃** (Dinitrogen trioxide), which is a deep-blue liquid (b.p. ~3°C) and can be used as a specialty non-aqueous solvent.\n    This set of identifications is consistent with the clues.\n\n5.  **Identify A and C using Clues (1) and (3).**\n    Clue (1): `A(s) + 8 NO₂(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    Clue (3): `C + H₂O -> A(s) + HNO₃ + HNO₂`\n    As noted in step 2, A is likely a metal that is oxidized by NO₂ to form C. In hydrolysis, the A(n+) cation must be reduced back to A(s). The reducing agent is conveniently provided by the other hydrolysis product, nitrous acid (HNO₂). This works well for noble metals that are difficult to oxidize and whose cations are strong oxidizing agents. A prime candidate is **Gold (Au)**.\n    The reaction of gold with NO₂ (or its dimer, N₂O₄) is known to produce a compound C. The reaction is:\n    `Au(s) + 4 N₂O₄(g) -> [NO]⁺[Au(NO₃)₄]⁻(s) + 3 NO(g)`\n    Since 1 N₂O₄ is equivalent to 2 NO₂, 4 N₂O₄ is equivalent to 8 NO₂. The stoichiometry of reactants A:B is 1:8. Although the reaction also produces 3NO, chemical puzzles often simplify the reaction products.\n    *   So we identify **A = Au** and **C = [NO][Au(NO₃)₄]** (Nitrosonium tetranitratoaurate(III)).\n    *   *Note on color*: This compound is typically described as pale yellow-orange. The \"bright red\" might be an inaccuracy in the puzzle or refer to a specific (perhaps impure) form. Given how well all other chemical facts fit, we proceed with this identification.\n    *   *Note on hydrolysis*: The hydrolysis works perfectly. NO⁺ gives HNO₂. [Au(NO₃)₄]⁻ gives Au(OH)₃ (which is Au³⁺) and HNO₃. Then, the HNO₂ reduces Au³⁺ back to Au(s).\n\n6.  **Identify E and its Symmetry using Clue (2).**\n    `C + 2 D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    Substituting our identified species:\n    `[NO][Au(NO₃)₄](s) + 2 NO(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    The problem states E is an extremely hazardous *molecule*, and we need to find its symmetry. C is a powerful oxidizing agent containing Au(III) and many nitrate groups. It is plausible that C reacts with NO (in which N is +2) to form a higher oxide of nitrogen.\n    A candidate for an extremely hazardous, molecular higher oxide of nitrogen is **N₂O₅ (Dinitrogen pentoxide)**. It is the anhydride of nitric acid, a powerful oxidizer, and an explosive solid.\n    The reaction would be C acting as an oxidizing agent and oxygen source to convert 2NO into N₂O₅:\n    `2NO + \"3O\" -> N₂O₅` (schematic oxidation from N(+2) to N(+5))\n    This transformation is chemically plausible given the potent nature of C.\n    *   So, we identify **E = N₂O₅**.\n\n7.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E.**\n    Now we must find the point group of the E molecule, N₂O₅.\n    The structure of N₂O₅ in the gas phase is O₂N-O-NO₂. It consists of two NO₂ groups linked by a central oxygen atom. The molecule is not planar; the two NO₂ groups are twisted with respect to each other.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper axis of rotation (Cn):** There is a C₂ axis that passes through the central oxygen atom and bisects the N-O-N angle. A 180° rotation about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Plane of symmetry (σ):** There are no planes of symmetry because of the twisted conformation of the NO₂ groups.\n    *   **Center of inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    *   **Improper axis of rotation (Sn):** There is no S₄ axis coincident with C₂.\n    Since the only symmetry element besides identity is a C₂ axis, the point group for N₂O₅ is **C₂**.\n\n8.  **Final Check.**\n    The option **C₂** is available in the choices provided. The entire chain of deductions holds together with a plausible (if slightly simplified) set of chemical reactions.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E (N₂O₅) is C₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
