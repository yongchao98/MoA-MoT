    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome.\n\n3.  **Identify the final state:** The desired outcome is that the measurement of $L_{1z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ AND the measurement of $L_{2z}$ yields the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for the z-component of angular momentum is $L_z |l, m\\rangle = m\\hbar |l, m\\rangle$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ means the first electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ means the second electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$. For simplicity, we can denote this state as $|m_1, m_2\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Relate the initial and final states using quantum mechanics principles:** The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Initial state: $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ (suppressing $l_1, l_2$ as they are fixed).\n    *   Final state: $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n    *   Probability $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Use the properties of angular momentum addition:** The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2, m}^{l_1, l_2, l} |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\n    where $C_{m_1, m_2, m}^{l_1, l_2, l} = \\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n6.  **Apply the selection rule for magnetic quantum numbers:** A fundamental property of the addition of angular momentum is that the z-components add up directly: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This leads to a crucial selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: they are non-zero only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   If $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, then the coefficient $\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle = 0$.\n\n7.  **Apply the selection rule to the specific problem:**\n    *   For the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with that of the final state ($m_1+m_2 = -2$).\n    *   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the selection rule is violated.\n    *   This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero: $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   The probability is the square of this coefficient: $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The desired final state has a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$. Since the total z-component of angular momentum is conserved in the representation change, the initial state is orthogonal to the desired final state. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
