    "This problem requires us to determine the products of the reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide (HBr).\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the reactant:**\n    The reactant is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n    *   \"benzene\" attached to an \"oxy\" group: Ph-O- (a phenyl ether)\n    *   The other part is \"(2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)\".\n        *   \"but\": a 4-carbon chain.\n        *   \"-3-en\": a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n        *   \"-1-yl\": the chain is attached to the oxygen at carbon 1.\n        *   \"2,2-dimethyl\": two methyl groups are on carbon 2.\n    *   The structure of the side chain is: -CH₂(1)-C(2)(CH₃)₂-CH(3)=CH₂(4).\n    *   So, the full structure of the reactant is: **Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂**.\n\n2.  **Identify the nature of the reactants and the reaction conditions:**\n    *   Reactant 1: An aryl ether with an isolated alkene functional group in the alkyl chain. The oxygen atom activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution, particularly at the ortho and para positions.\n    *   Reactant 2: Hydrogen bromide (HBr). This is a strong acid (H⁺ source) and a source of a nucleophile (Br⁻).\n\n3.  **Propose possible reaction mechanisms:**\n\n    *   **Ether Cleavage:** Cleavage of aryl ethers requires harsh conditions. Cleavage of the alkyl C-O bond is possible but usually doesn't compete with reactions at the alkene unless at high temperatures. If it happened, it would produce phenol and an alkyl bromide, which doesn't directly lead to any of the options except A, but the side chain in A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Electrophilic Addition of HBr to the Alkene:** The double bond can react with HBr. The H⁺ will add first to form the most stable carbocation (Markovnikov's rule).\n        *   The double bond is -CH=CH₂. Protonation can occur at the terminal CH₂ to form a secondary carbocation at C3: Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃.\n        *   The Br⁻ could then attack this carbocation, leading to the Markovnikov addition product: Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH(Br)-CH₃ ((3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene). This appears in option B.\n        *   Anti-Markovnikov addition would give Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-CH₂Br ((4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene). This is generally favored only under radical conditions (e.g., with peroxides), not with just HBr.\n\n    *   **Acid-Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization:** This is the most likely pathway given the structure. The reaction proceeds via the formation of a carbocation which then acts as an electrophile, attacking the electron-rich benzene ring (intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution).\n\n        **Step 1: Formation of Carbocation**\n        As in the electrophilic addition, H⁺ adds to the terminal carbon of the double bond to form the more stable secondary carbocation (Intermediate I):\n        Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺ → Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃ (Intermediate I)\n\n        **Step 2: Pathway A - Cyclization of the Secondary Carbocation**\n        The carbocation (Intermediate I) is an electrophile. It can be attacked by the ortho-position of the activated benzene ring. This attack will form a new C-C bond, leading to a cyclized product. Let's count the atoms in the newly forming ring: O-C1-C2-C3-C(ortho)-C(ipso). This forms a **6-membered ring**.\n        *   The product is a chromane derivative (a tetrahydropyran ring fused to benzene).\n        *   The substituents on the chromane ring are determined by the side chain structure:\n            *   C2 of the original chain has two methyl groups. This carbon becomes C3 of the chromane ring. -> **3,3-dimethyl**\n            *   C3 of the original chain (the carbocation) has a methyl group. This carbon becomes C4 of the chromane ring. -> **4-methyl**\n        *   So, this product is **3,3,4-trimethylchromane**. This matches the first product in option C.\n\n        **Step 3: Pathway B - Rearrangement and Subsequent Cyclization**\n        Carbocations can rearrange to form more stable carbocations. The secondary carbocation (Intermediate I) can undergo a 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon (C2).\n        Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃  → [1,2-Me shift] → Ph-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂ (Intermediate II)\n        This new carbocation (Intermediate II) is a **tertiary carbocation**, which is more stable.\n\n        Now, this rearranged tertiary carbocation can also attack the ortho-position of the benzene ring.\n        *   Let's count the atoms in the new ring: O-C1-C2-C(ortho)-C(ipso). This forms a **5-membered ring**.\n        *   The product is a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivative.\n        *   Let's determine the substituents on this ring:\n            *   C2 of the original chain (the carbocation) now becomes C3 of the dihydrobenzofuran ring. It is attached to one methyl group and one isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). -> **3-methyl-3-isopropyl**\n        *   So, this second product is **3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**. This matches the second product in option C.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction conditions (acid) and the structure of the starting material strongly favor an intramolecular cyclization mechanism. The initial formation of a secondary carbocation, which can either cyclize directly to a 6-membered ring or rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation and then cyclize to a 5-membered ring, perfectly explains the formation of two distinct products. These two products are precisely those listed in option C. The TLC result showing the disappearance of the reactant and the appearance of two new spots is consistent with the formation of this product mixture.\n\n    *   **Option A** is incorrect as it involves an unlikely ether cleavage and incorrect alkyl group structure.\n    *   **Option B** describes simple addition products and ignores the highly favorable intramolecular cyclization. Anti-Markovnikov addition is also unlikely.\n    *   **Option D** involves an unlikely rearrangement product and the unlikely anti-Markovnikov addition product.\n    *   **Option C** describes the two products formed from a well-established and chemically sound intramolecular cyclization mechanism involving a carbocation rearrangement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
