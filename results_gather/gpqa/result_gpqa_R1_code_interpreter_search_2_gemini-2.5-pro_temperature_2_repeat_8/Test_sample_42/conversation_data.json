    "This problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene ring. We will solve this by first deducing the structure of the molecule from the description and then applying the systematic IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Identify the main scaffold and functional groups:**\n    *   Scaffold: A benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl when a substituent)\n        *   Cyano group (-CN)\n        *   Hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Methoxy group (-OCH₃)\n\n2.  **Place the groups based on their relative positions:**\n    *   Let's start by placing the highest priority group, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, at position **C1** of the benzene ring.\n    *   \"A carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" And also meta to the carboxylic acid. This means these three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups are at positions **C3** and **C5**. We don't know which is which yet.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\". The para position to C1 is **C4**. So, the **methoxy group (-OCH₃)** is at **C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\". The ortho positions to C1 are **C2** and **C6**. So, the **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)** groups are at these positions. Again, we don't yet know which is which.\n    *   The final clue resolves the ambiguities: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it. Positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. Thus, the **cyano group (-CN)** must be at either **C3 or C5**.\n        *   **Case A:** If the cyano group (-CN) is at **C3**. To be ortho to the methoxy (at C4), this condition is met. The other group ortho to the cyano group is the hydroxyl group (-OH). The other ortho position to C3 is C2. Therefore, the **hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C2**.\n        *   **Case B:** If the cyano group (-CN) is at **C5**. This is also ortho to the methoxy (at C4). The other ortho position to C5 is C6. Therefore, the **hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6**.\n\n    *   Let's evaluate both cases. They actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from different perspectives (i.e., they are identical). Let's proceed with the structure derived from Case A, as it will lead to the same final name.\n\n    *   From **Case A**:\n        *   -COOH at C1\n        *   -OH at C2 (because it's ortho to the -CN at C3)\n        *   -CN at C3\n        *   -OCH₃ at C4\n        *   This leaves C5 for the -CHO group (from the meta arrangement) and C6 for the -N(CH₃)₂ group (from the ortho arrangement to -COOH).\n\n3.  **Final structure determined:**\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -OH\n    *   **C3:** -CN\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃\n    *   **C5:** -CHO\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n2.  **Numbering the Ring:** We need to number the ring's carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. We have two options, numbering clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Our deduced structure corresponds to numbering **counter-clockwise**: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂). The set of locants for the substituents is **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**.\n    *   If we were to number **clockwise**, the substituents would be at: C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH). The set of locants is also **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**.\n\n3.  **Applying the Tie-Breaker Rule:** When both numbering directions result in the same set of locants, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituent Prefixes:**\n    *   -CN: **c**yano\n    *   -N(CH₃)₂: **d**imethylamino\n    *   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n    *   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n    *   -OCH₃: **m**ethoxy\n\n    The alphabetical order is: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n\n5.  **Assign the Final Numbering:**\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   In the counter-clockwise direction, \"cyano\" is at C3.\n    *   In the clockwise direction, \"cyano\" is at C5.\n    *   Since 3 < 5, the **counter-clockwise direction** is the correct numbering scheme.\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Name:** Now, we list the substituents (with their correct locants from the counter-clockwise numbering) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name.\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   benzoic acid\n\n    Combining these gives the final IUPAC name:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:** This name matches option B exactly.\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrectly ordered prefixes (not alphabetical).\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.**\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering (used clockwise instead of counter-clockwise).\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect ordering and numbering.\n\n<<<B>>>"
