    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a single proton (an alpha-proton).\n        *   These peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, and their individual integrals are \"roughly equal.\" This implies the two species represented by the peaks are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n        *   The observation of two peaks is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n        *   **Inference:** The sample contains two different compounds, or two distinct, slowly interconverting conformations of the same compound. Since these two species give rise to different NMR signals, they must be in chemically distinct environments.\n\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram.\n        *   This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be physically separated by chromatography.\n        *   The two LC peaks have \"equal intensities,\" reinforcing the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n        *   Critically, both peaks yield the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass corresponds to the expected target molecule.\n        *   **Inference:** The two species are **isomers** – they have the same molecular formula and molecular weight but differ in their three-dimensional structure. The analysis was run at \"elevated temperature,\" which is a relevant detail. Some isomers can interconvert, and temperature affects the rate of this conversion. The fact they are still seen as two *separate* peaks suggests that even at elevated temperatures, their interconversion is slow on the LC timescale, or the chromatography itself separates them effectively.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations (the options provided):**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n        *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical properties (e.g., solubility, boiling point) and identical spectroscopic properties.\n        *   Therefore, standard ¹H NMR and standard LC (using a non-chiral column) cannot distinguish between enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would show only *one* set of peaks in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC.\n        *   This option contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor from a chemical synthesis is a starting material or an intermediate that has not fully reacted.\n        *   It would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight than the final product.\n        *   The MS data clearly shows both separated species have the *same mass* as the expected product.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This side reaction would involve an extra amino acid being added, likely to an unreacted amine.\n        *   This would create a branched, larger molecule with a significantly higher molecular weight than the target peptide.\n        *   The MS data shows that the mass is consistent with the *expected* molecule, not a larger one.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the stereochemistry differs at one or more, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have **different physical and spectroscopic properties**.\n        *   Therefore, they will have different ¹H NMR spectra (e.g., two alpha-proton peaks instead of one).\n        *   They can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, giving two distinct peaks.\n        *   By definition, they are isomers, so they will have the same molecular formula and mass, consistent with the MS data.\n        *   **How do they form?** In peptide synthesis, a common side reaction is the racemization of the chiral alpha-carbon of an amino acid during the amide bond formation step. If the synthesis is coupling a new L-amino acid onto a growing peptide chain (which is already chiral), some of the L-amino acid may convert to its D-enantiomer before coupling. The result is a mixture of the all-L peptide (the desired product) and a peptide where one residue is a D-amino acid. These two resulting peptides are diastereoisomers of each other. Another possibility in peptides is the existence of cis-trans rotamers around a proline amide bond, which are also diastereomeric and often separable. Both scenarios lead to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereoisomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided analytical data: two sets of signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and identical mass for both components.\n\n<<<D>>>"
