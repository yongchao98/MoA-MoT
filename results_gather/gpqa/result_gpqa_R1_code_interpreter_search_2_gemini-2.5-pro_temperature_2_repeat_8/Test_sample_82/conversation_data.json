    "Step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.0010 mol.\n*   The initial solution is diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n*   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution is:\n    *   Molarity = Moles / Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n*   This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   First, calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles of conjugate base to acid is 25/75 or 1/3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is also 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\n\n# --- pH at 25% titration ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n# The ratio [A-]/[HA] at 25% titration is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"pKa: {pKa:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npKa: 4.73\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\n</execute_result>\nFrom the calculation, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.0010 mol) has been neutralized by NaOH. The solution contains 0.0010 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.020 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   Now, set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate. Let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Assuming x is much smaller than 0.020, we can simplify:\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.020\n    *   x² = Kb × 0.020\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.020)\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.0010  # mol\nconc_NaOH = 0.1  # M\nvolume_diluted_acid = 0.040 # L\n\n# --- pH at equivalence point ---\n# Calculate volume of NaOH added at equivalence point\nvol_NaOH_eq = initial_moles_acid / conc_NaOH\n# Calculate total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = volume_diluted_acid + vol_NaOH_eq\n# Calculate concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nconc_acetate_eq = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration\n# [OH-] = x = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_eq)\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_eq = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_result>\nFrom the calculation, the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n**Conclusion**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An additional python script is not needed.\nThe thinking process and execution results have provided a complete solution.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated from the initial volume and molarity:\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.0010 mol CH₃COOH\n*   The solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the new volume is:\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   The concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is:\n    *   New Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This means the solution contains 75% HA and 25% A⁻, creating a buffer.\n*   The pH of this buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   First, we find the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of the moles, which is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, we calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n*   From the first Python script execution:\n    *   pKa ≈ 4.73\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.0010 mol) has been reacted with NaOH to form 0.0010 mol of its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   First, we must determine the total volume of the solution. We need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize the acid:\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   The total volume at the equivalence point is:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) at this point:\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.020 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We can find the [OH⁻] by setting up the equilibrium expression: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb = x² / (0.020 - x)\n*   Assuming x is very small compared to 0.020, we simplify to Kb ≈ x² / 0.020.\n*   Solving for x:\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.020) = √(5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.020) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n*   This matches the result from the second python script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\nThe pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
