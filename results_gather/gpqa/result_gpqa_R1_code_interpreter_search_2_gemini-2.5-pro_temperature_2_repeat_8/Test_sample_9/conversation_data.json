    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the baseline: Option a)**\n    *   This describes a planet identical to Earth in both mass and radius.\n    *   The density of Earth is approximately 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). We will use this as our reference density.\n    *   Density of planet (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option b)**\n    *   This planet is described as having 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   The density is explicitly given and is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   Density of planet (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option c)**\n    *   This describes a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Such a planet is often called a \"super-Earth\".\n    *   The key concept here is **gravitational compression**. For celestial bodies with the same composition, a more massive body will exert a stronger gravitational pull on its own material.\n    *   This increased gravity compresses the materials (rock and metal core) more tightly, packing the same amount of matter into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy.\n    *   Since Density = Mass / Volume, and the mass is much larger while the material is more compressed (reducing the proportional increase in volume), the overall density will be *higher* than Earth's.\n    *   Therefore, the density of planet (c) > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option d)**\n    *   This describes a planet with the same composition as Earth but only half its mass. This is a \"sub-Earth\".\n    *   Following the same logic of gravitational compression, this less massive planet will have weaker self-gravity.\n    *   The materials will be *less* compressed than they are inside Earth.\n    *   This means its overall density will be *lower* than Earth's.\n    *   Therefore, the density of planet (d) < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these values, the planet in option (c) has the highest density because its immense mass causes the greatest degree of gravitational compression.\n\n<<<A>>>"
