    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and then use this information to decide whether the theory is renormalizable. The analysis is done using dimensional analysis in a system of natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$.\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nThe action, $S$, is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nIn natural units, the action $S$ is dimensionless. The spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of (length)$^4$. Since energy has dimension of mass $[M]^1$ and length has dimension of inverse mass $[M]^{-1}$, the dimension of $d^4x$ is $[M]^{-4}$.\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[M]^4$.\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = M^4$.\n\nAny term added to the Lagrangian must also have this mass dimension. Thus, for our interaction term, we must have:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the dimension of $\\kappa$, we first need the dimensions of the fields $\\psi$ and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We can deduce these from their standard kinetic terms in the Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin, \\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. Let's consider the derivative term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n    The mass dimension of this term must be $M^4$:\n    $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu\\psi]_M = M^4$\n    The Dirac gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless. The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has the dimension of inverse length, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = M^1$. The dimensions of $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same, let's call it $[\\psi]_M$.\n    So, $[\\psi]_M \\cdot [\\psi]_M \\cdot M^1 = M^4$.\n    $[\\psi]_M^2 = M^3 \\implies [\\psi]_M = M^{3/2}$.\n    Therefore, $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin, A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    The mass dimension of this term must be $M^4$:\n    $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$\n    This implies $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M^2 = M^4$, so $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^2$.\n\n*   **The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n    $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^0 = 1$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ from the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M[\\bar{\\psi}]_M[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M[\\psi]_M[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = M^4$\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^{3 + 2} = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot M^5 = M^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory by power-counting depends on the mass dimensions of the coupling constants of its interaction terms.\nLet a generic coupling constant be $g$.\n*   If $[g]_M > 0$, the interaction is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If $[g]_M = 0$, the interaction is **renormalizable**.\n*   If $[g]_M < 0$, the interaction is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nSince the mass dimension of our coupling constant $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **non-renormalizable**. In perturbation theory, such an interaction leads to ultraviolet divergences that become worse at each higher order, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb them. This makes the theory lose its predictive power.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
