    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and major products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Catalyst:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent ester groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized malonate enolate ion.\n    *   **Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The p-tolyl group is a methyl-substituted phenyl group.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Attack:** The `[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]` carbanion attacks the β-carbon, causing the C=C double bond's π-electrons to shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   `[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃ → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃`\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-⁻CH-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n\n4.  **Identifying Product (A):** The structure of the product is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. Following IUPAC nomenclature for polyfunctional compounds, this can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate derivative. Let's number the propane chain `C3-C2-C1`. C1 has two `COOCH₃` groups, C2 has the `p-tolyl` group, and C3 is part of a `CH₂COOCH₃` group. The name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n**Conditions:** MeOH, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Identification of Reactants:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a variant of the Michael reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon of the enamine double bond.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium salt after protonation of the nitrile-stabilized anion by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   The substituent from butenenitrile added to the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The intermediate is an iminium salt: `[2-(-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)-cyclohex-1-en-1-yl]piperidinium` ion.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine amine is removed.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n\n4.  **Identifying Product (B):** The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. The substituent is derived from butenenitrile. To name the molecule, the nitrile group (CN) takes priority. The parent chain is butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone moiety is a substituent at position 3 of the butane chain.\n    *   **Product Structure:** 2-oxo-cyclohexyl group attached to C3 of a butanenitrile chain.\n    *   **Product Name:** **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product under these conditions.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK)\n**Conditions:** KOH, H₂O\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis:** We need to work backward from the product to find the unknown reactant C. The reaction is a Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃`).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the acceptor `CH₂=CH-R` gets added to the nucleophile as a `-CH₂-CH₂-R` group. Here, `R = -C(=O)CH₃`. So the group added is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`, which is a `3-oxobutyl` group.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Bond Formed:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `3-oxobutyl` substituent is attached at the C2 position of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. This C-C bond is the one formed during the Michael addition.\n\n3.  **Identifying Reactant (C):** By disconnecting this bond, we can identify the nucleophile. Removing the `3-oxobutyl` group from C2 of the product and replacing it with a hydrogen atom gives us the Michael donor.\n    *   **Product:** `(2-(3-oxobutyl))cyclohexane-1,3-dione`\n    *   **Disconnect:** Remove `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃` group from C2.\n    *   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n4.  **Reaction Plausibility:** Cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a β-diketone. The protons on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) are highly acidic and are readily removed by a base like KOH to form a stable enolate, which is an excellent Michael donor. This confirms that reactant C is indeed cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of compounds matches the choices provided in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
