    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nThe starting material is a cyclohexanone ring. It has three functional groups: a ketone (at C1), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH at C3), and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2 at C5).\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Purpose:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Mechanism:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a good nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an Sₙ2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n*   **Purpose:** To convert the ketone into a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate for the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. This is a condensation reaction that forms a C=N double bond and eliminates a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone (-C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The full name is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n*   **Purpose:** This is the Shapiro reaction, which reductively converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH group of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon atom alpha to the C=N double bond (the carbon that was originally part of the ring adjacent to the ketone). The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a p-toluenesulfinate anion to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The final step is quenching this intermediate with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl) to form the alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed in the ring, originating from the carbon that bore the ketone. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The exact location of the new double bond in the ring does not affect the final structure after the next step. Product 3 contains three reducible groups: the cyclohexene double bond, the isopropenyl double bond, and the benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n*   **Purpose:** Catalytic hydrogenation to reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and hydrogenolysis to cleave the benzyl ether protecting group.\n*   **Mechanism:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is an effective catalyst for multiple reductions.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The C=C double bonds in both the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether bond (C-O) is cleaved by hydrogen. The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), and toluene (Bn-H) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n    *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    *   (Benzyloxy)methyl group → Hydroxymethyl group\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-positions of the substituents are maintained throughout the reaction sequence. If we number the final cyclohexane ring so that the carbon with the hydroxymethyl group is C1, the isopropyl group will be at C3. Therefore, the product is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our derived structure with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl ether should be cleaved, and the butyl group should not be present.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the product if only hydrogenation occurred but not the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches the outcome of all four reaction steps.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This ignores the Shapiro elimination reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
