    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Sources of Solar Neutrinos by Energy\n\nFirst, we need to identify which nuclear reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos in the energy bands of interest. The main neutrino-producing reactions and their energy ranges are:\n\n*   **pp-I Chain:**\n    *   `p + p → ²H + e⁺ + νₑ` (`pp` neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n*   **pp-II Chain:**\n    *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ` (`⁷Be` neutrinos): Produces two sharp, monoenergetic lines at **861 keV** (90% of the time) and 383 keV (10% of the time).\n*   **pp-III Chain:**\n    *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ` (`⁸B` neutrinos): Continuous spectrum up to ~15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:**\n    *   `¹³N` decay neutrinos: Continuous spectrum up to 1.20 MeV (1200 keV).\n    *   `¹⁵O` decay neutrinos: Continuous spectrum up to 1.73 MeV (1730 keV).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means there are no more neutrinos produced from `⁸B` decay. All other reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue as normal.\n\n### 3. Determine the Neutrino Flux in Each Energy Band\n\nNow let's examine which reactions contribute to the flux in the two specified energy bands under this hypothetical scenario.\n\n*   **Band 1: 700 keV - 800 keV**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos? No, their energy is too low (< 420 keV).\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? No, the lines are at 383 keV and 861 keV, which are outside this band.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos? No, this reaction has been stopped.\n    *   CNO (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`) neutrinos? **Yes**. Their continuous spectra cover this energy range.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of neutrinos is the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **Band 2: 800 keV - 900 keV**\n    *   `pp` neutrinos? No.\n    *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? **Yes**. The very strong, monoenergetic line at **861 keV** falls squarely within this band. This reaction is part of the pp-II chain, which is unaffected.\n    *   `⁸B` neutrinos? No, this reaction has been stopped.\n    *   CNO (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`) neutrinos? **Yes**. Their continuous spectra also cover this range.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The sources are the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV and CNO neutrinos.\n\n### 4. Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes\n\nTo find the ratio, we need to compare the flux in Band 1 with the flux in Band 2.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1)** = Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.\n*   **Flux (Band 2)** = Flux from the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV + Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.\n\nLet's consult the standard solar model for the approximate fluxes of these components as measured at Earth:\n*   Total `⁷Be` neutrino flux: ~5.0 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹. About 90% of this is in the 861 keV line, so its flux is ~4.5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹. Since this is a line source, its entire flux is contained within Band 2.\n*   Total CNO neutrino flux (sum of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O`): ~5.2 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹. This flux is spread over a wide continuous spectrum. The portion that falls within the narrow 100 keV window of Band 1 is only a small fraction of this total.\n\nNow, let's compare the key contributions:\n*   The flux in Band 2 is **dominated** by the immense `⁷Be` line flux of ~4.5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹. The contribution from CNO neutrinos in this band is orders of magnitude smaller and can be considered negligible for an approximate calculation.\n*   The flux in Band 1 consists *only* of the CNO contribution. Let's estimate this value. From plots of the solar neutrino spectrum, the differential flux of CNO neutrinos (flux per keV) in this region is on the order of 10⁵ cm⁻²s⁻¹keV⁻¹. To get the total flux in the 100 keV wide band, we multiply:\n    Flux(Band 1) ≈ (10⁵ cm⁻²s⁻¹keV⁻¹) * (100 keV) = 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio\n\nNow we can compute the approximate ratio:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (CNO flux in Band 1) / (`⁷Be` flux in Band 2)\n\nRatio ≈ (10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹) / (4.5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹)\n\nRatio ≈ 1 / 450 ≈ 0.0022\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA) 10.\nB) 1.\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nD) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n\nOur calculated ratio (~0.0022) is closest in order of magnitude to 0.01. A more precise calculation using integrated values from the Standard Solar Model confirms this. For instance:\n\n*   Integrated CNO flux (700-800 keV) ≈ 5 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹\n*   Integrated `⁷Be` flux (in Band 2) ≈ 4.5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹\n*   Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (4.5 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.011\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
