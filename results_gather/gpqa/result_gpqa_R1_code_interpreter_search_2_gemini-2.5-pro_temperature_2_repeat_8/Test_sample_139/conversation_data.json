    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** 277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is remarkably close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The standard melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that substance **B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** Since we've identified B as D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned must be Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen. Therefore, Substance X contains Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\" is released.\n        *   **Reasoning:** Let's consider small gas molecules that could be formed in a reaction involving a deuterated compound.\n            *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n            *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Incorrect)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D) and 2 neutrons (1 per D). Protons = Neutrons. (Correct)\n        *   This confirms that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W (D₂)... and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, the source of all the hydrogen atoms must be deuterium. This implies that both the reagent (X) and the solvent (Y) must be deuterated. A violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is characteristic of a strong reducing agent (like a metal hydride) reacting with a protic solvent.\n        *   Thus, Liquid Y is likely D₂O.\n        *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂(g) + G(s).\n        *   The precipitate G, when heated, produces D₂O. This is consistent with G being a metal hydroxide (or in this case, deuteroxide), which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and water (D₂O). For example, `M(OD)n → M_xO_y + D₂O`.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** We are looking for a powerful, deuterated reducing agent. The most common and powerful hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ is known for its extremely violent reaction with water. Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n        *   Let's assume **Substance X is LiAlD₄**. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, a cornerstone reagent in organic chemistry.\n        *   Let's check the keto acid reaction. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., pyruvic acid: CH₃-CO-COOH, which has 3 oxygens). LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both functional groups.\n            *   R-CO-R' (ketone) → R-CD(OH)-R'\n            *   R-COOH (carboxylic acid) → R-CD₂OH\n        *   Reducing pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) gives CH₃CD(OH)CD₂OH (a deuterated 1,2-propanediol). This final product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms the clue.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of X and the Reaction**\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)\n    *   **Reaction:** The full reaction is LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → 4 D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate. Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). All clues fit perfectly.\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X:** Substance X is LiAlD₄. The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form, Deuterium D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** We compare the elements by their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (Z=1) -> Lightest Element\n        *   Lithium (Z=3)\n        *   Aluminum (Z=13) -> Heaviest Element\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative masses:** The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of *all atoms* of the lightest and heaviest elements. We use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The primary isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass = 27.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium isotope (²H). Mass of one D atom is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Sum the masses:** Cumulative mass = (Mass of Aluminum) + (Total mass of Deuterium) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
