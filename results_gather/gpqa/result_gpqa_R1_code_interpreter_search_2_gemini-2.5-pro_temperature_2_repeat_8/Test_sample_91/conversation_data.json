    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we need to follow a series of steps based on the principles of thermochemistry. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n`12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using a Hess's law cycle involving the atomization of reactants and products. The formula derived from this cycle is:\nΔHf° = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactant elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product molecule)]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\n\nThe chemical structure of the molecule is 2,5,8-trimethylnona-2,7-diene.\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Number of Carbon atoms (C):** 9 carbons in the main chain skeleton and methyl groups. A detailed count gives C12.\n    Let's verify with the formula for an acyclic diene: CnH2n-2. For n=12, H = 2*12 - 2 = 22.\n*   **Number of Hydrogen atoms (H):** Counting the hydrogens in each group: 2*(CH3) + CH + CH2 + CH + CH3 + CH2 + CH + 2*(CH3) gives 6+1+2+1+3+2+1+6 = 22.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The name \"diene\" indicates two double bonds, which are at positions C2=C3 and C7=C8 in the expanded structure. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The remaining bonds in the carbon skeleton are single bonds. A systematic count reveals **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactant Elements**\n\nThe reactant elements are 12 moles of C(s, graphite) and 11 moles of H2(g). We need to convert them into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:**\n    ΔH = 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** We need to break 11 moles of H-H bonds in H2 gas.\n    ΔH = 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous C12H22 molecule to form gaseous atoms.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   **Total Bond Energy of C12H22:**\n    8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nNow, we use the formula from Hess's law:\nΔHf° = [Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants] - [Total Bond Energy of Product]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Check the Options and Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is +1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches our result, but the unit is kJ/g, not kJ/mol)\n\nSince our calculated value is in kJ/mol, we should convert it to kJ/g to check option A.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    M = (12 * 12.011 g/mol) + (22 * 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol.\n    Using integer masses (12 for C, 1 for H) gives 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option A (11.44 kJ/g) when rounded. Option D is incorrect because of the units. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbe_H_H = 100           # kJ/mol\nbe_C_C = 200           # kJ/mol\nbe_C_double_C = 300    # kJ/mol\nbe_C_H = 400           # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula: C12H22\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_double_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.
