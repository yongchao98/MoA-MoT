    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of function. This indicates G2 is essential for resistance.\n    *   Now, let's look at the double mutants involving G2. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to the phenotype of one of the corresponding single mutants.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). This means that G2 is **epistatic** to G1 (the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation). In a genetic pathway, the epistatic gene is typically upstream.\n    *   The double mutant `g2g3` has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance), not the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). This means that G2 is also **epistatic** to G3.\n    *   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and we know at least one gene is a transcription factor (a protein that regulates the expression of other genes), G2 is the strongest candidate. It acts as an upstream regulator required for the function of both G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway.\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is a transcription factor (or an essential upstream component). This eliminates option C, which states G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has a 75% resistance level (a 25% loss from control).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has a 50% resistance level (a 50% loss from control).\n    *   If the genes acted independently in different pathways, we might expect their effects to be additive. The combined loss would be around 25% + 50% = 75%, leading to a predicted resistance of 25%.\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, which corresponds to a 90% loss.\n    *   Since the loss of both genes (90% loss) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (75% loss), this is a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   A synergistic interaction between two genes that contribute to the same outcome is often interpreted as **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 have similar or overlapping functions, so when one is lost, the other can still partially compensate. When both are lost, the function is almost completely eliminated.\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (or a synergistic interaction).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the remaining options based on these conclusions.**\n    *   **Option A:** \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the G1/G3 relationship as redundancy. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect, as the phenotype of `g1g3` (10%) is not the same as `g1` (75%). However, the first two conclusions are strongly supported by the data.\n    *   **Option B:** \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". It correctly identifies G2, but claiming they have the \"same promoter\" is a specific molecular hypothesis that cannot be concluded from this genetic data. The epistasis claim is also incorrect (`g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n    *   **Option D:** \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". It correctly identifies G2. However, \"pleiotropy\" is the incorrect term; pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, not the interaction between two genes. The epistasis claim is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Selection.**\n    Option A contains two strongly supported conclusions drawn directly from the experimental data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). The other options contain incorrect terminology (pleiotropy) or unsubstantiated speculation (same promoter). Despite the error in its final clause about epistasis (which is likely a flaw in the question), Option A provides the best overall description of the gene interactions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
