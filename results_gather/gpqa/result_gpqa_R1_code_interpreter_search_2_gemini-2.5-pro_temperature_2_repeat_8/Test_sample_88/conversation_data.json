    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and spectral data for Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). This is a tricyclic alkane derivative. Adamantane has a cage structure with 3 fused cyclohexane rings in chair conformations. Its formula is C10H16.\n*   **Reaction 1:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C gives Product **1**.\n*   **Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) group, likely a ketone in a six-membered ring or a slightly strained ring system.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Total proton count is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14H.\n*   **Contradiction:** The total proton count (14H) corresponds to a formula of C10H14O, assuming the adamantane cage is intact. A C10H14O tricyclic ketone (e.g., adamantanone) is a saturated ketone. However, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is typical for vinylic protons (C=CH), suggesting an alkene. A molecule that is both a ketone and an alkene would be an unsaturated ketone, which would have fewer than 14 hydrogens (e.g., C10H12O for a tricyclic structure). This is a significant contradiction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the subsequent reactions to resolve the contradiction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product **1** is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) to form Product **2**. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product **2** is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n*   **Logical Deduction:** The fact that Product **2** reacts with ozone means that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**.\n*   Since Product **2** is formed by the reduction of Product **1** (a ketone), Product **1** must also have contained that same C=C double bond (MPV reduction does not typically affect isolated C=C bonds).\n*   Therefore, **Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone**.\n*   A tricyclic unsaturated ketone with a C10 skeleton would have a formula of C10H12O (DU = 3 for rings + 1 for C=O + 1 for C=C = 5; C10H12O gives DU = (2*10+2-12)/2 = 5).\n*   This confirms that the ¹H NMR data with 14 protons cannot be for Product **1**.\n*   **Resolving the contradiction:** The most likely explanation is that the NMR data provided actually describes Product **2**. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   Product **1** is an unsaturated ketone (C10H12O), which has an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Product **2** is the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (C10H14O), formed by reducing the C=O of Product **1**. The formula C10H14O is consistent with a tricyclic alkene alcohol (DU = 3 for rings + 1 for C=C = 4; C10H14O gives DU = (2*10+2-14)/2 = 4).\n    *   The provided NMR spectrum has 14 non-exchangeable protons, perfectly matching the formula C10H14O for Product **2**. The peak at 4.79 ppm would correspond to the two vinylic protons of the C=C bond.\n    *   This hypothesis resolves all contradictions and is chemically sound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure and ozonolysis of Product 2.**\n\n*   We now accept that Product **2** is a symmetric unsaturated alcohol C10H14O with the NMR spectrum: 4.79(2H, vinylic), 2.41-2.23(10H, aliphatic), 1.94(2H, aliphatic). We also have one OH proton which is not listed (or has been exchanged).\n*   The presence of a single signal at 4.79 ppm for two vinylic protons implies that the double bond is symmetric, meaning it is of the form R-CH=CH-R'. The molecule has a plane of symmetry or a C2 axis that makes the two vinylic protons and their respective environments equivalent.\n*   **Ozonolysis:** Product **2** undergoes ozonolysis to form Product **3**. The double bond is cleaved:\n    C10H14O (Product 2) + O₃, then DMS → C10H14O₃ (Product 3)\n    The reaction cleaves the C10 ring system containing the double bond, converting the two carbons of the double bond into aldehyde groups (-CHO). Product **3** is therefore a bicyclic dialdehyde that also contains the original alcohol group.\n*   Due to the symmetry of Product **2**, the resulting dialdehyde (Product **3**) must also be symmetric. This means its two aldehyde groups are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in Product **3** are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (H-C=O), which typically have a chemical shift (δ) of 9-10 ppm.\n*   We need to determine the splitting pattern of this aldehyde proton signal. The splitting is determined by the number of adjacent protons (`n`) according to the n+1 rule.\n*   The aldehyde group in Product **3** (-CHO) is formed from a carbon of the double bond in Product **2** (-CH=). The splitting of the aldehyde proton will therefore depend on the number of protons on the carbon that was adjacent to the double bond in Product **2** (the allylic carbon).\n*   Let the fragment in Product **2** be: `-C(n H)-CH=CH-C(n H)-`\n*   After ozonolysis, the corresponding fragment in Product **3** is: `-C(n H)-CHO`\n*   The aldehyde proton signal will be split into an `n+1`-plet by the `n` adjacent protons.\n*   We must determine the value of `n`. We can't know the exact structure of Product 2, but we can use the available options to deduce `n`.\n    *   A) **triplet:** `n+1 = 3` → `n=2`. This implies the carbon adjacent to the double bond in Product 2 was a -CH₂- group.\n    *   B) **pentet:** `n+1 = 5` → `n=4`. This would require a -CH₄- group, which is impossible.\n    *   C) **doublet of triplets** and D) **triplet of triplets:** These complex patterns arise from coupling to multiple, non-equivalent groups of protons. This would contradict the high symmetry of Product **2** implied by its simple NMR spectrum.\n*   The most straightforward and logical possibility that matches a given option is that `n=2`. This scenario, where the carbons allylic to the symmetric double bond are both -CH₂- groups, is a common structural motif and is fully consistent with the reasoning above.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIf the carbon atom adjacent to the aldehyde group is a CH₂ group (`n=2`), the aldehyde proton signal will be split into a triplet (`n+1 = 3`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
