    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Goal:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere, created by the interaction between the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified. We can model this system by replacing the sphere with a single \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location inside the sphere's original volume. This replacement is valid for calculating the potential and field *outside* the sphere.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) that satisfy the condition `V=0` on the surface `r=R` are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated as the work done to assemble it. A general formula for the potential energy of a system with charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n5.  **Apply the Energy Formula to this System:**\n    *   Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere.\n    *   The energy formula is `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * ∫_sphere σV dS`.\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, the potential `V` is zero everywhere on its surface. Therefore, the integral term `(1/2) ∫_sphere σV dS` is zero.\n    *   The total potential energy simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`.\n\n6.  **Find the Potential at `q`'s Location:** `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   According to the method of images, the potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges is exactly the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   So, we can find `V_at_q` by calculating the potential from `q'` at the location of `q`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)` where `k = 1/(4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n7.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b` into the equation for `V_at_q`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expression for `V_at_q`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator's denominator cancels with the `d` in the denominator's denominator:\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `V_at_q` back into the simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   This gives the final result:\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated expression is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   This exactly matches option D.\n\n---\n\n<<<D>>>"
