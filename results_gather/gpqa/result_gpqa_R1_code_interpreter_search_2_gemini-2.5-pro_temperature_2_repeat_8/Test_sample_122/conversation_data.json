    "This is a classic problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   Let S be the reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary for this problem).\n    *   Let S' be the reference frame of the supernova ejecta (the moving frame).\n\n2.  **List the known variables:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame, S') is Δt' = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (d) the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Formulate the plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula: `d = v * Δt`, where Δt is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) is different from the time measured in the ejecta's frame (Δt') due to time dilation.\n    *   The time dilation formula relates the two times: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   So, the steps are:\n        a. Calculate the ratio v/c.\n        b. Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ.\n        c. Use γ to find the time in the Galaxy's frame, Δt.\n        d.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v`, is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the frame that is at rest relative to the clock.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The time measured in the stationary frame (S), `Δt`, is related to the proper time in the moving frame (S'), `Δt'`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ` (gamma).\n    *   The formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we can calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now substitute `Δt` into the distance formula `d = v * Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, let's compute `3,000,000 / √0.96`.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000  # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance_galaxy:.2f} km\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is: 3061862.18 km\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without relativistic effects).\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are correct. Let's summarize the results to arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle**: The problem involves two different inertial reference frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 0.2c). Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: An observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (the \"stationary\" frame) will observe time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. The 50 seconds (`Δt'`) that pass in the ejecta's frame correspond to a longer period of time, `Δt`, in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Calculation Steps**:\n    *   **Time in the Galaxy Frame (`Δt`)**:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n        The previous calculation showed: `Δt = γ * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`.\n\n    *   **Distance in the Galaxy Frame (`d`)**:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862.18 km`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of **3,061,862.18 km** is closest to option D. The small difference is due to rounding in the option choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
