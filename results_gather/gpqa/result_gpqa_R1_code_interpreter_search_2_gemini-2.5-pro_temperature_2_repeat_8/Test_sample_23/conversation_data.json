    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n    I will break down the given information into individual facts about the substances and reactions involved.\n    *   **Mixture X**: Contains two liquids, let's call them A and B. They are in an equimolar ratio (1:1).\n    *   **Property of X**: Decolorizes bromine water. This is a classic test for unsaturation, meaning A and B must contain carbon-carbon double (C=C) or triple (C≡C) bonds.\n    *   **Constraint on X**: \"No conjugated multiple bonds.\" This is a specific structural detail about A and B.\n    *   **Reaction**: Mixture X, when heated with a Platinum (Pt) catalyst, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.\n    *   **Mixture Y**: Contains two different liquids, C and D, also in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   **Property of Y**: Does *not* decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds or aromatic.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**: A crucial clue. Both mixture X (A+B) and mixture Y (C+D), when hydrogenated under severe conditions with a Pt catalyst, yield *only one substance*, a hydrocarbon Z. This implies that A, B, C, and D all share the same fundamental carbon skeleton.\n    *   **Substance Z**:\n        *   It is one of the components of mixture Y.\n        *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n        *   It is widely used as a solvent.\n        *   It is fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\").\n\n2.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The most concrete piece of information is the composition of Z.\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, or 0.1428.\n    *   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol:\n        Mass % H = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428\n        y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)\n        y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y\n        0.8572y = 1.7136x\n        y/x ≈ 1.999 ≈ 2\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n    *   The general formula for an acyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. The mass fraction of H would be (2n+2)/(14n+2).\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of H would be 2n/(14n) = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Given that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\", the most common and fitting candidates are cyclopentane (C₅H₁₀) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's assume cyclohexane, as it is extremely common.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Carbon Skeleton and Identities of C and D**\n    *   Let's proceed with the hypothesis that Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of A, B, C, and D all lead to Z, they must all be based on a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of C and D. Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y. So, let C = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated, so it doesn't. What is D?\n    *   The reaction to form Y is a disproportionation. This is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses H, in this context) and reduced (gains H). So, if C (C₆H₁₂) is the reduced product, D must be the oxidized product.\n    *   Starting from a C₆ skeleton, the most oxidized, stable product is benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Does D = Benzene fit the criteria?\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}. It's a mixture of two liquids. Check.\n        *   Does it decolorize bromine water? Cyclohexane does not. Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, also does not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst). So, this fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y ({C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}) must give only Z (C₆H₁₂).\n            *   C₆H₁₂ + H₂ → No reaction (or remains C₆H₁₂)\n            *   C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂ (This requires \"severe conditions\", as stated).\n            *   The only final product is cyclohexane (Z). Check.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Identities of A and B**\n    *   Now we know the overall reaction: X(A,B) → Y(Benzene, Cyclohexane).\n    *   It's a disproportionation where X is an equimolar mixture of A and B, and Y is an equimolar mixture of C and D. This points to a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: A + B → C + D.\n    *   Substituting the knowns: A + B → C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogens in one molecule of A and one of B must be 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   A and B both have a C₆ ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C₆Hₓ and C₆Hᵧ. So, x + y = 18.\n    *   A and B decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated alkenes/alkadienes. This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   A and B have no conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's look at possible C₆ cyclic alkenes:\n        *   Cyclohexene: C₆H₁₀. It has one double bond, not conjugated. A possible candidate.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: C₆H₈. It has two double bonds, which *are* conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: C₆H₈. It has two double bonds, which are separated by CH₂ groups and are *not* conjugated. A possible candidate.\n    *   Let's test the combination of A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Does x + y = 18? Yes, 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Is the mixture X equimolar? The problem states it is.\n    *   The reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a known type of catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction, a form of disproportionation. One molecule (cyclohexene) acts as a hydrogen acceptor (is reduced) and the other (1,4-cyclohexadiene) as a hydrogen donor (is oxidized). Actually, the thermodynamics strongly favors formation of the stable benzene ring, so the overall reaction where one becomes fully saturated and the other fully aromatic is plausible. The hydrogen balance is perfect.\n\n5.  **Final Verification and Answer Calculation**\n    *   Let's review everything one last time.\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)}. Both unsaturated, non-conjugated. Check.\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. Doesn't decolorize Br₂ water. Check.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Matches %H, properties, and is in Y. Check.\n        *   Hydrogenation of X (C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈) gives only cyclohexane. Check.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y (C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆) gives only cyclohexane. Check.\n        *   Reaction X → Y is a valid, balanced disproportionation. Check.\n    *   The logic holds. Now, I will answer the question asked.\n    *   Question: \"Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\"\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (A) and one molecule of the second liquid (B).\n    *   Liquid A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) → 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) → 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
