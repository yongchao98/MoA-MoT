    "An object is optically active if it is chiral and cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The plane containing the carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) and the atoms directly attached to it acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (`3aR`, `7aS`) and at a double bond (`E`).\n    *   The presence of these stereochemical descriptors indicates that the molecule is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A molecule with multiple stereocenters is chiral unless it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the parent structure (a substituted norbornane derivative), it is extremely unlikely to be meso.\n    *   Since a specific enantiomer is named, it must be chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other substituted carbon group.\n    *   When a molecule has two identical chiral centers with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral due to internal symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion in its staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in its eclipsed conformation). Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   Both chiral centers have the same configuration (R). The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound.\n    *   Since it is a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1, which is the carbon bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This carbon is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, a -CH=CH- group (C2-C3), and a -CH2-CH2- group (C6-C5). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This nomenclature describes the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the more stable chair conformation where all three large -OH groups are in equatorial positions. This molecule has a C3 axis of rotation. More importantly, it possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon with its hydroxyl group (e.g., C1) and the opposite carbon (C4).\n    *   Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's examine the structure for any chiral centers. The carbon atom `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to one H, one `CH2-` group, and two identical `CH3` groups, so it's not a chiral center. No other atom in the chain or the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is not conformationally locked into a chiral shape. It has a plane of symmetry (passing through the carbonyl group and bisecting the isobutyl group).\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (meso)\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
