    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically that of a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for Carbon + 16 for first Oxygen + 16 for second Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45 amu).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O at 1700 cm⁻¹) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen. We are left with B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C at 1650 cm⁻¹) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in addition to the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Use Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    The degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C carbons and H hydrogens is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n\n    *   Our identified functional groups tell us we must have at least two degrees of unsaturation:\n        *   One for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n        *   One for the C=C bond.\n        *   Total required DoU = 2.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_string):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the degrees of unsaturation for a given chemical formula like 'C6H12O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_string)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_string)\n    \n    if c_match and h_match:\n        c = int(c_match.group(1))\n        h = int(h_match.group(1))\n        dou = c - h / 2 + 1\n        print(f\"Formula: {formula_string}, Degrees of Unsaturation = {int(dou)}\")\n\n# Candidate formulas\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H12O2\")\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H10O2\")\n\n```\n executing code...\n\n**Code Output:**\n```\nFormula: C6H12O2, Degrees of Unsaturation = 1\nFormula: C6H10O2, Degrees of Unsaturation = 2\n```\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The compound C6H12O2 has only one degree of unsauration. This can account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond (e.g., in hexanoic acid), but it cannot also have a C=C bond.\n    *   The compound **C6H10O2** has two degrees of unsauration. This perfectly accommodates both the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and the C=C bond confirmed by the spectroscopic data. An example of such a molecule would be a hexenoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that matches all the experimental data is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one found in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** This is direct confirmation of a C=C double bond in the molecule, as vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, which has a mass of 45 (12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H).\n\n**Synthesizing the Information:**\n\n*   From the FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data, we have definitively identified a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates choices A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O).\n*   From the FTIR and ¹H NMR data, we have also identified a **carbon-carbon double bond** (C=C).\n\n**Using Degrees of Unsaturation:**\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation (DoU) tell us the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. A C=O bond is one degree of unsaturation, and a C=C bond is another. Therefore, our molecule must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n\n*   **For B (C6H12O2):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**\n    *   This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It can account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond (e.g., in hexanoic acid), but it cannot also have the C=C bond confirmed by the data.\n\n*   **For D (C6H10O2):**\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**\n    *   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our requirements: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical formula C6H10O2 is the only one that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, which indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<D>>>"
