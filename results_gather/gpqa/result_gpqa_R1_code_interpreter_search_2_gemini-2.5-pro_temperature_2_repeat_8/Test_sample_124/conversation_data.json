    "This is a quantum mechanics problem concerning the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Potential:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the potential is the same in all directions, as it only depends on the radial distance $r$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalues of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation. This can be done by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates or spherical polar coordinates.\n\n    *   **In Cartesian Coordinates:**\n        The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The problem separates into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n        $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n        $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n        $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n        where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n        Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. Then the energy formula simplifies to:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state. It corresponds to $n = 0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n = 1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n = 2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n = 3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to write $n=3$ as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem. The number of ways to distribute $n$ identical items into $k$ distinct bins is given by the formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$.\n    In our case, $n = 3$ (the principal quantum number) and $k = 3$ (the number of dimensions: x, y, z).\n    The degeneracy $g_n$ for a level $n$ is:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{n+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{n+2}{2} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$.\n\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  (3 states)\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  (6 states)\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1)  (1 state)\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue is equal to the degeneracy, which is 10.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 10 - Incorrect energy formula.\n    B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, 10 - Correct energy and degeneracy.\n    D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3 - Incorrect energy formula and degeneracy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
