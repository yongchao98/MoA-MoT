    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n*   **The Vector Field (f):**\n    *   The magnitude is given by `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n    *   The field is purely radial. This means its direction is always pointing directly away from or towards the origin. In spherical coordinates, we can write the vector field as `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **The Volume of Integration (V):**\n    *   A sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\n\nThere are two primary methods to approach this problem:\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Calculation:** Calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` first, and then integrate it over the volume `V`.\n*   **Method 2: The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem):** This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the boundary of the volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is often simpler, especially for problems with spherical symmetry. Let's use this method.\n\n**3. Applying the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere.\n*   `S` is the boundary surface of the sphere (a spherical shell of radius R).\n*   `n̂` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`.\n*   `dS` is the differential element of surface area.\n\n**4. Executing the Calculation**\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`.\n\n*   **Identify `f` on the surface S:** The surface `S` is a sphere of constant radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is always equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n\n*   **Identify the normal vector `n̂`:** For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`. So, `n̂ = r̂`.\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ n̂`:**\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = ((1/R^2) * r̂) ⋅ (r̂)`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = |r̂|^2 = 1`, the dot product is:\n    `f ⋅ n̂ = 1/R^2`\n    This value is a constant for all points on the surface of the sphere.\n\n*   **Evaluate the surface integral:**\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    The integral `∮_S dS` represents the total surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n**5. Considering the Singularity at the Origin**\n\nOne might try to calculate the divergence directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r)`.\n*   `f_r = 1/r^2`\n*   `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n\nThis result `∇ ⋅ f = 0` is valid everywhere *except* at the origin `r=0`, where the field `f = 1/r^2` is undefined (singular). The integral `∫ (0) dV` would naively give 0.\n\nSo why does the Divergence Theorem give `4π`? The Divergence Theorem, as applied here, correctly accounts for the \"source\" or singularity at the origin. The non-zero value of the integral signifies that there is a source of the field at the origin, and `4π` is its total strength. This situation is analogous to Gauss's Law for a point charge in electromagnetism. The divergence of this field is technically `4πδ(r)`, where `δ(r)` is the Dirac delta function, which is zero everywhere except the origin and integrates to 1. Integrating `4πδ(r)` over a volume containing the origin yields `4π`. The Divergence Theorem provides a convenient way to get this result without dealing with delta functions directly.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
