    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities from the experimental data.**\n\n*   The gas mixture from the decomposition is passed through a series of tubes.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2 * 1.0 + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is lime water, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition. This implies that the original salts likely do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas = 0.05 mol atoms / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas (at STP) remains.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, an alkali solution, or hot copper. This suggests it's a relatively inert gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture.**\n\nBased on the products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂), the original salts must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O) atoms, plus a cation that does not leave a solid residue. The fact that the products are all gaseous strongly suggests the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺).\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol O.\n    *   From O₂: 0.05 mol O atoms.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 mol N / 1 mol N₂ = 0.20 mol N.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the total mass and deduce the identity of the salts.**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the calculated elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our product identification is correct.\n\nNow, let's find the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements (N:H:O) in the entire mixture:\n*   Ratio = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   Divide by the smallest value (0.20): 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiply by 4 to get whole numbers: 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   The total empirical formula of the mixture of A and B is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. We need to split the formula N₄H₈O₅ into two chemically plausible salt formulas.\n*   Since the products are all gaseous, we assume the cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺). The 8 H atoms correspond to two NH₄⁺ ions.\n*   So, our mixture contains two NH₄⁺ ions in total. We are left with (N₄H₈O₅ - 2 × NH₄) = (N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n*   We need to distribute the two NH₄⁺ cations and the N₂O₅ moiety into two salts, A and B. The logical distribution is one NH₄⁺ for each salt.\n*   The N₂O₅ must be split into two anions. The common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Adding these two anions gives: NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ = N₂O₅²⁻. This seems incorrect. Let's look at the neutral molecules that combine with the cations: we must split the N₂O₅ part into two separate anion groups that sum to a charge of -2. Anion 1 must have a -1 charge to balance the first NH4+, and Anion 2 must have a -1 charge to balance the second NH4+. Thus we split N₂O₅ into NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻.\n*   This gives us the two salts:\n    *   **Salt A:** NH₄⁺NO₂⁻ → **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n    *   **Salt B:** NH₄⁺NO₃⁻ → **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\n**Step 4: Verify with decomposition reactions and calculate the final answer.**\n\nLet's check if the decomposition of these two salts produces the correct ratio of products. We have an equimolar mixture, so let's say `x` moles of each.\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nFrom `x` mol of NH₄NO₂ and `x` mol of NH₄NO₃:\n*   Total N₂ = x (from A) + x (from B) = 2x\n*   Total H₂O = 2x (from A) + 2x (from B) = 4x\n*   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5x (from B) = 0.5x\n\nUsing our experimental moles:\n*   Moles N₂ = 0.10 mol → 2x = 0.10 → x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles H₂O = 0.20 mol → 4x = 0.20 → x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles O₂ = 0.025 mol → 0.5x = 0.025 → x = 0.05 mol.\nThe value `x = 0.05 mol` is consistent for all products, confirming our salt identities are correct.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Formula N₂H₄O₂. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Formula N₂H₄O₃. Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
