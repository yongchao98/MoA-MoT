    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Two Physical Processes:**\n    *   **λ1 (Lambda 1):** This represents the mean free path of a residual gas molecule before it collides with another residual gas molecule. This is a \"molecule-molecule\" interaction.\n    *   **λ2 (Lambda 2):** This represents the mean free path of a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam before it is scattered by a residual gas molecule. This is an \"electron-molecule\" interaction.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formulas for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is generally defined as λ = 1 / (nσ), where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` (sigma) is the collision/scattering cross-section.\n\n    *   **For λ1 (Molecule-Molecule):** We are considering a gas where all particles are identical and in thermal motion. The standard formula from the kinetic theory of gases applies, which includes a factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the particles:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        Here, `n` is the number density of the gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules.\n\n    *   **For λ2 (Electron-Molecule):** We are considering a beam of very fast particles (1000 kV electrons) moving through a gas of relatively slow-moving molecules. The speed of relativistic electrons is so much greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules that the molecules can be considered stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor is not used:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision/Scattering Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    The key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective cross-sections, `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n    *   **`σ_gg` (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. A collision occurs when the centers of two molecules, each with a diameter `d`, come within a distance `d` of each other. The effective target area is σ_gg = πd². This represents a \"hard sphere\" kinetic collision and is relatively large.\n\n    *   **`σ_eg` (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This represents the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event. The electron is a point-like particle, and at 1000 kV, it is highly energetic and relativistic. Such an electron is highly penetrating. To be significantly scattered (i.e., to have its trajectory changed enough to be considered a \"collision\" in the context of TEM imaging), it needs to pass very close to the strong electric field of the atomic nucleus or have an inelastic interaction with an atomic electron. It can easily pass through the diffuse electron cloud of the molecule without significant interaction. Consequently, the cross-section for a high-energy electron to be scattered (`σ_eg`) is considerably *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section for two molecules to collide (`σ_gg`).\n    \n    *   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** `σ_gg > σ_eg`. In fact, based on published data, `σ_gg` is often orders of magnitude larger than `σ_eg` for MeV-range electrons.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths (λ2 / λ1):**\n    Let's take the ratio of the two MFP equations:\n\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\n    Simplify the expression by canceling `n` and rearranging:\n\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    \n    λ2 = λ1 * √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    We established that `σ_gg > σ_eg`, which means the ratio (`σ_gg / σ_eg`) is a number greater than 1.\n    Therefore:\n    \n    λ2 / λ1 > √2 \n    λ2 > 1.414 * λ1\n\n    This result tells us that the mean free path for the electron (`λ2`) must be significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (`λ1`).\n\n    Now, let's evaluate the given options based on our derived conclusion `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`:\n    *   A) `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`: This statement is true. If a number is greater than 1.414, it is necessarily also greater than or equal to 1.22.\n    *   B) `λ2 = λ1`: This is false.\n    *   C) `λ2 < λ1`: This is false.\n    *   D) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1`: This is false because it sets an upper bound of `1.22 * λ1`, while our result shows that `λ2` must be *greater* than `1.414 * λ1`.\n\nThe only option consistent with the physical principles is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
