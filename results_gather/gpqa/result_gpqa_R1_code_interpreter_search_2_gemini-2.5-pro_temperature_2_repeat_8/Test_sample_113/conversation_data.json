    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction.\n    *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        3.  This intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. A common way to represent a generic acid or a proton source in an aqueous solution is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Looking at the options for A, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable choice. NaHSO₃ is used for bisulfite addition, a different type of reaction with carbonyls.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**. This narrows down the possibilities to options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is called hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base, typically with heating. The problem shows that the reaction uses reagent B and water (H₂O).\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN is treated with aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The nitrile is protonated, attacked by water, and eventually hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN is treated with aqueous base (like NaOH). Hydroxide attacks the nitrile carbon, leading to the formation of a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻) and ammonia (NH₃). An acidic workup step is then required to protonate the carboxylate to get the final carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** The product is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate salt, suggesting an acid-catalyzed process is used directly or a base-catalyzed process followed by acidification. The options for B (from C and D) are HCl and CH₃COOH.\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid and is a very common and effective reagent for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to some extent, it is generally not strong enough for efficient and complete hydrolysis. Strong mineral acids like HCl are the standard choice.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the more appropriate and effective reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
