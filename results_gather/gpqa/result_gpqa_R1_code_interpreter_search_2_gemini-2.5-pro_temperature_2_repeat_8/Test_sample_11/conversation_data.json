    "This is a problem about a two-body decay of a particle at rest. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the process and given values:**\n    *   The decay is `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`.\n    *   The `Pi(+)` particle is stationary (at rest).\n    *   Rest mass of `Pi(+)`, `m_π*c^2 = 139.6` MeV.\n    *   Rest mass of `mu(+)`, `m_μ*c^2 = 105.7` MeV.\n    *   The neutrino (`nu` or `ν_μ`) is assumed to be massless (`m_ν = 0`), which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial `Pi(+)` is at rest, its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles, `mu(+)` and `nu`, must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        *   `p_i = 0`\n        *   `p_f = p_μ + p_ν = 0`\n        *   This means `|p_μ| = |p_ν|`. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        *   Initial energy (`E_i`): Since the `Pi(+)` is at rest, its energy is just its rest mass energy.\n          `E_i = m_π*c^2 = 139.6` MeV.\n        *   Final energy (`E_f`): This is the sum of the total energies of the `mu(+)` and the `nu`.\n          `E_f = E_μ + E_ν`\n        *   Therefore, `m_π*c^2 = E_μ + E_ν`.\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   For the `mu(+)`: `E_μ^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_μ*c^2)^2`.\n    *   For the massless `nu`: `m_ν = 0`, so `E_ν = |p_ν*c| = p*c`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        1.  `E_ν = p*c`\n        2.  `E_μ^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n        3.  `m_π*c^2 = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n    *   From equation (3), we can express `E_μ` as: `E_μ = m_π*c^2 - E_ν`.\n    *   Now, substitute this `E_μ` and `p*c = E_ν` (from eq. 1) into equation (2):\n        `(m_π*c^2 - E_ν)^2 = (E_ν)^2 + (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n\n    *   Expand the left side of the equation:\n        `(m_π*c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_π*c^2) * E_ν + E_ν^2 = E_ν^2 + (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n\n    *   The `E_ν^2` term cancels on both sides:\n        `(m_π*c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_π*c^2) * E_ν = (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n\n    *   Now, we solve for `E_ν`:\n        `2 * (m_π*c^2) * E_ν = (m_π*c^2)^2 - (m_μ*c^2)^2`\n        `E_ν = [ (m_π*c^2)^2 - (m_μ*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_π*c^2 ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   We can use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its total energy is its kinetic energy: `KE_ν = E_ν`.\n    *   For the muon, its kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest mass energy: `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c^2`. We can find `E_μ` from the energy conservation equation: `E_μ = m_π*c^2 - E_ν`.\n\n```python\n# Given values in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# E_nu = [ (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi_c2 ]\ne_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy\nke_nu = e_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using energy conservation\n# m_pi_c2 = E_mu + E_nu  =>  E_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu\ne_mu = m_pi_c2 - e_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\nke_mu = e_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results\n# The problem statement does not specify the order, but usually it's for mu(+) then nu.\n# The options have the smaller value first, which corresponds to the muon.\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n>>>\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (`mu+`) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (`nu`).\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of a stationary pion (`Pi(+)`) into a muon (`mu(+)`) and a neutrino (`nu`). We can find the kinetic energies of the product particles by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Decay process: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n*   Initial `Pi(+)` is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of `Pi(+)` (`m_π*c²`): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of `mu(+)` (`m_μ*c²`): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (`nu`) is considered massless (`m_ν = 0`).\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its total momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the final products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   `p_μ` = momentum of the muon\n*   `p_ν` = momentum of the neutrino\n*   `p_μ + p_ν = 0` => `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):** Since the pion is at rest, its energy is its rest mass energy.\n    `E_i = m_π*c² = 139.6 MeV`\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):** The sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_μ`) and the neutrino (`E_ν`).\n    `E_f = E_μ + E_ν`\n*   Therefore, `m_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n**4. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) is related to momentum (p) and rest mass energy (`mc²`) by: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n*   For the muon: `E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n*   For the massless neutrino: `E_ν = |p_ν*c| = p*c`\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies:**\nWe can substitute `p*c = E_ν` into the equation for the muon's energy:\n`E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n\nFrom energy conservation, we have `E_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν`. Substituting this into the equation above:\n`(m_π*c² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n`(m_π*c²)² - 2*(m_π*c²)*E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μ*c²)²`\n\nThe `E_ν²` term cancels out. Solving for `E_ν`:\n`E_ν = [ (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π*c² ]`\n\nFor a massless neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`KE_ν = E_ν`).\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n`E_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`E_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`E_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`\nSo, `KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n\nNow, we can find the total energy of the muon (`E_μ`) from energy conservation:\n`E_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν`\n`E_μ = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_μ`) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n`KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²`\n`KE_μ = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are **4.12 MeV** (for the muon) and **29.8 MeV** (for the neutrino). This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
