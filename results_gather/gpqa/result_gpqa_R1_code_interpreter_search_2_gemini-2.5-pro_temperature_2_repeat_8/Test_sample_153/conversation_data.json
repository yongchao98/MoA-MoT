    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 amu.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100 / 32 ≈ 3.1. This ~3:1 ratio is a characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimers formed by carboxylic acids.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is typical for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The 's' indicates it is a singlet (no adjacent protons), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. Each type is adjacent to the other, causing them to split each other into doublets.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW=156.5. Contains Cl. It has an aldehyde and a phenol group, not a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR would be more complex with three different aromatic protons. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW=156.5. Contains Cl. This is an acyl chlorid/ester. It lacks the -OH group needed for the broad IR peak and the carboxylic acid proton in the NMR. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **MW:** Its chemical formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. MW = (7×12)+(5×1)+(1×35)+(2×16) = 156 amu. (Correct)\n        *   **Cl atom:** It has one chlorine atom. (Correct)\n        *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Matches IR)\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and a 1,4 (para) disubstituted benzene ring. This substitution pattern gives rise to two doublets, each for 2H. (Matches NMR perfectly)\n        *   This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW=156.5. Contains Cl. It is a carboxylic acid. However, it is a 1,2 (ortho) disubstituted ring. This structure lacks the necessary symmetry to produce the simple two-doublet pattern seen in the ¹H NMR; it would show four distinct aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The evidence overwhelmingly points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. It is the only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data: the molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern from the mass spec, the carboxylic acid group indicated by the IR, and the specific *para*-substitution pattern shown in the ¹H NMR.\n\n<<<C>>>"
