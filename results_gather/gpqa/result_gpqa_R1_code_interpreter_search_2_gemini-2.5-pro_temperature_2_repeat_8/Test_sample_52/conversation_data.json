    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n\n*   **Compound type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogens have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group is present. An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Two signals suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution), where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) with a hydrogen on each carbon (-CH=CH-). The splitting pattern gives more detail:\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This means the proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet split). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl substituent.\n        *   This means the second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out the presence of any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (-CH2-) unit.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n*   From the analysis above, we can identify the building blocks of the molecule:\n    1.  A para-substituted phenylene ring (**p-C6H4**).\n    2.  A propenyl group (**-CH=CH-CH3**).\n    3.  An ester group (**-COO-**) containing the second methyl group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester attached via the oxygen (**-OCOCH3**).\n\n*   Let's assemble these pieces. The two substituents on the p-C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-COOCH3`.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-OCOCH3`.\n\n*   Both of these structures are consistent with all the FTIR and 1H NMR data provided.\n\n**3. Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the chemical formula for the deduced structure(s). Both possibilities will have the same count of atoms.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   From the phenylene ring (C6H4): 6 carbons\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 carbons\n    *   From the methyl ester (-COOCH3) or acetate (-OCOCH3) group: 2 carbons (one carbonyl C, one methyl C)\n    *   **Total Carbon = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   From the phenylene ring (C6H4): 4 hydrogens\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5 hydrogens (1+1+3)\n    *   From the methyl group of the ester (-CH3): 3 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 oxygens\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2**\n\n*   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE for a formula CxHyOz is calculated as: DBE = x - y/2 + 1.\nFor C11H12O2: DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n\nLet's check the DBE from the deduced structure:\n*   Benzene ring: 1 ring (1 DBE) + 3 double bonds (3 DBE) = 4 DBE\n*   Propenyl C=C double bond: 1 DBE\n*   Ester C=O double bond: 1 DBE\n*   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\nThe calculated DBE from the formula matches the DBE from the deduced structure, confirming our analysis.\n\n**5. Match with the Options:**\n\nThe calculated formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
