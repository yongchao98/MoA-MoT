    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis**: A principal axis of rotation where a 360°/3 = 120° rotation results in an identical molecule.\n2.  A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nThe C3h point group contains the symmetry operations {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}. Importantly, a molecule with C3h symmetry does *not* have C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have vertical mirror planes (σv). If it did, it would belong to a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\n**Analyzing the Molecules**\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**D) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (CH).\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene bridges.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**. This is not C3h.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring fused with three maleic anhydride-like rings.\n*   **Symmetry Elements (Idealized)**:\n    *   Assuming the molecule is planar, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The plane of the molecule acts as a σh mirror plane.\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Point Group**: The combination of C3, perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane defines the point group as **D3h**. While a D3h molecule contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is higher than C3h. (Note: Advanced computational studies show this molecule distorts from planarity to a C2 symmetry ground state, but in the context of introductory chemistry, the idealized D3h structure is considered.) This is not C3h.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of molecule C, based on a triphenylene core. The anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges.\n*   **Symmetry Elements (Idealized)**:\n    *   Like molecule C, this molecule is expected to be planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis through the center, perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It also has three C2 axes in the plane and three σv planes.\n*   **Point Group**: For the same reasons as molecule C, the point group is **D3h**. This is not C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups, B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. Unlike the other molecules, it is highly flexible due to rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Elements (in a specific conformation)**:\n    *   The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. Let's define this plane as the horizontal plane (σh).\n    *   A C3 axis can be imagined perpendicular to this plane, passing through the boron atom.\n    *   To achieve C3h symmetry, the three isopropyl groups must adopt a specific, synchronized conformation. Imagine a conformation where for each group, the methine C-H bond lies within the σh plane, and of the two methyl groups, one points \"up\" (above the plane) and the other points \"down\" (below the plane). If all three isopropyl groups are arranged this way, in a \"propeller\" fashion, the entire molecule will have a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Crucially, this specific conformation lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and lacks any σv planes. Rotating one group to the opposite side lands in empty space, and reflecting through a vertical plane does not map the molecule onto itself.\n*   **Point Group**: In this idealized conformation, the point group is **C3h**. While this may not be the lowest energy ground-state conformation, it is the only molecule on the list that *can* adopt C3h symmetry. In problems of this type, one often looks for a plausible, symmetrical conformation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nQuinuclidine is C3v. The two anhydride molecules (A and C) are D3h in their idealized planar forms. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule that can adopt a conformation with exactly C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
