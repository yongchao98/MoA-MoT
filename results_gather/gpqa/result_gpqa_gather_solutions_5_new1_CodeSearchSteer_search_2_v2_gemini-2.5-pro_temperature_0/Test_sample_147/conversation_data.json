  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nFive binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (let's denote it as YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n    Rearranging for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We need to test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, K). These don't form five binary fluorides.\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr). Let's check Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol).\n        If Y=Kr and n=2, A2 would be KrF2.\n        Let's calculate the precise ɷF for KrF2: M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (38 / 121.8) * 100% = 31.20%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Let's check Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol).\n        If Y=Sb and n=3, A2 would be SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (57 / 178.76) * 100% = 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu). If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. ɷF = 31.84%. Also a very close match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n\n    *   **Clue about A4:** \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This implies A4 itself is colorless or forms a colorless solution.\n        *   Antimony fluorides: SbF3 and SbF5 are colorless. This fits.\n        *   Plutonium fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF6 are all colored. This does not fit.\n        *   Krypton fluorides: KrF2 is a colorless solid. This fits.\n\n    *   **Clue about A1:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine.\"\n        *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. The decomposition A1 -> SbF3 + F2 implies A1=SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is thermally stable, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   If Y=Kr, A2=KrF2. The decomposition A1 -> KrF2 + F2 implies A1=KrF4. KrF4 is a theoretically predicted but highly unstable compound. Its properties are unknown, but it's plausible for a problem to assign it a color (bright-red) and have it decompose at room temperature. This fits the chemical logic well.\n\n    *   **Clues about oxidizing Xenon:** \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\".\n        *   If Y=Kr, A1=KrF4 and A3 could be KrF2. Both are extremely strong oxidizing agents and are known (or expected) to react with Xenon. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Clue about the reaction to form A5:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... a solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n        *   If Y=Kr, A4 is a colorless fluoride, so A4=KrF2. The reaction is Kr + KrF2 -> A5. A plausible 1:1 reaction is the formation of two moles of the radical, KrF. So, A5 = KrF. The radical KrF would readily decompose in water, which fits the final clue.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the identity of Y and the compounds.**\n    The Krypton (Kr) hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent story, despite the slight discrepancy in the mass percentage (31.2% vs 31.96%), which can be attributed to an error in the problem statement. The Antimony (Sb) case, while matching the mass percentage better, fails on several key chemical properties of the compounds.\n\n    Therefore, we can identify the substances as:\n    *   Y = Kr (Krypton)\n    *   A1 = KrF4 (hypothetical bright-red, unstable compound)\n    *   A2 = KrF2 (decomposition product)\n    *   A3 = KrF2 (reacts with Xe)\n    *   A4 = KrF2 (colorless, used in the final reaction)\n    *   A5 = KrF (product of Kr + KrF2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, A4 is KrF2.\n    Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(KrF2) = M(Kr) + 2 * M(F)\n    MW(A4) = 83.80 g/mol + 2 * 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 38.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 121.80 g/mol. This value falls within the range given in option B.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\nThe correct range is 110-130.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical properties described, the element Y is identified as Platinum (Pt). Here is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Element Y and its Fluorides**: The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. Platinum is known to form five such compounds: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.\n\n2.  **Substance A1**: A1 is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red, volatile solid known to be one of the most powerful oxidizing agents. It is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon, a noble gas. It is also thermally unstable. Therefore, A1 is PtF₆.\n\n3.  **Substance A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition of platinum hexafluoride can yield lower fluorides. A plausible decomposition is PtF₆ → PtF₄ + F₂. This would make A2 = PtF₄. Another possibility is the decomposition to PtF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n    *   For PtF₄, the calculated ωF is approximately 28.03%.\n    *   For PtF₅, the calculated ωF is approximately 32.75%.\n    The value for PtF₅ is closer to the one given in the problem, suggesting a likely typo in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry problems. Assuming the chemical properties are the primary identifiers, we proceed with the platinum hypothesis. Let's tentatively identify A2 as PtF₄, based on the simple decomposition reaction.\n\n4.  **Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Platinum) and can also interact with xenon. Fluorination of platinum can produce PtF₄ or PtF₆. Since A1 is PtF₆ and A2 is PtF₄, and the five compounds are distinct, this step presents a challenge if A1-A5 must all be different. However, if we re-examine the decomposition of A1, PtF₆ can decompose to PtF₅. Let's refine the assignments:\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆** (Red, oxidizes Xe, decomposes)\n    *   **A2 = PtF₅** (Decomposition product, ωF ≈ 32.75%, close to 31.96%)\n    *   **A3 = PtF₄** (Product of fluorinating Pt, different from A1 and A2. As a strong fluorinating agent, interaction with xenon is plausible).\n\n5.  **Substances A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding element Y (Pt) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction: Pt⁰ + PtFₙ → PtFₘ. The remaining known fluorides are PtF₂ and the lesser-known PtF. The only reaction that fits a 1:1 molar ratio is:\n    Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF\n    This means **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\n6.  **Decomposition of A5**: The final clue states that A5 (PtF) decomposes in water. As a sub-halide, this is chemically very likely, probably through disproportionation.\n\n7.  **Molecular Weight of A4**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. Based on the deduction, A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n    *   The atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) is approximately 195.08 g/mol.\n    *   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of PtF₂ = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls into the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:** The problem states that compound A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can use this information to determine the identity of element Y. The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine in a binary compound YF_n is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. By rearranging the formula and testing integer values for n, we can find a plausible atomic mass for Y and identify the element.\n\n2.  **Identify Other Compounds (A1, A3):**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F2). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of Y than A2.\n    *   A1 and A3 both oxidize xenon, indicating they are very strong oxidizing agents. This typically corresponds to the highest known fluoride of an element.\n    *   Based on the identity of Y, we can deduce the formulas for A1 and A3.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   The core chemical reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y to A4. A4 and A5 are also binary fluorides of Y.\n    *   We will consider the possible fluorides of Y for A4.\n    *   We will analyze the 1:1 reaction to determine which candidate for A4 is chemically plausible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:** Once A4 is identified, we will calculate its molecular weight.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:** We will compare the calculated molecular weight of A4 with the given options to find the correct range.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by identifying the unknown element and its compounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2\n    omega_F = 0.3196  # Mass fraction of Fluorine in A2\n    M_F = 19.00      # Atomic mass of Fluorine\n\n    # Dictionary of relevant elements and their atomic masses\n    elements = {\n        'Sb': 121.76, 'I': 126.90, 'Pt': 195.08, \n        'Dy': 162.50, 'Br': 79.90, 'Bi': 208.98\n    }\n\n    best_fit = {'element': None, 'n': 0, 'error': float('inf'), 'formula': ''}\n\n    # Loop through possible numbers of F atoms (n) to find the best fit for Y\n    for n in range(1, 7):\n        # M_Y = (n * M_F / omega_F) - n * M_F\n        M_Y_calculated = n * M_F * (1/omega_F - 1)\n        for symbol, mass in elements.items():\n            error = abs(M_Y_calculated - mass) / mass\n            if error < best_fit['error']:\n                best_fit.update({\n                    'element': symbol, \n                    'n': n, \n                    'error': error, \n                    'formula': f\"{symbol}F{n}\"\n                })\n\n    Y_element_symbol = best_fit['element']\n    Y_element_mass = elements[Y_element_symbol]\n    A2_formula = best_fit['formula']\n    A2_n = best_fit['n']\n\n    # Verification of the mass fraction for the best fit (SbF3)\n    # M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76\n    # omega_F_check = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%\n    # This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming Y=Sb and A2=SbF3.\n    \n    # Step 2 & 3: Identify A4\n    # Y = Antimony (Sb), A2 = SbF3.\n    # A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF3) and F2, so A1 must be a higher fluoride, SbF5.\n    # A3 oxidizes Xe, so it must be the strongest fluorinating agent, SbF5.\n    # The remaining compounds are A4 and A5.

Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19.0 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\nM(Y) = n × 19.0 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) = n × 19.0 × (3.1289 - 1)\nM(Y) = n × 19.0 × 2.1289\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Sc). Not known for five fluorides.\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br). Bromine fluorides (BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅) do not have ɷF near 31.96%.\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb, M = 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's verify the ɷF for SbF₃ and PuF₆:\n*   For SbF₃: M = 121.76 + 3×19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. ɷF = (3×19.00)/178.76 = 57/178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is an excellent match for 31.96%.\n*   For PuF₆: M = 244 + 6×19.00 = 358 g/mol. ɷF = (6×19.00)/358 = 114/358 = 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is also an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Candidates for Y (Sb vs. Pu)**\n\nLet's use the other clues to decide between Sb and Pu.\nThe problem states: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine.\" This means A1 is a higher fluoride than A2 (A1 -> A2 + F₂).\n\n*   If Y = Pu, then A2 = PuF₆. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF₇ or PuF₈), which are not known to exist. This makes the Pu hypothesis unlikely.\n*   If Y = Sb, then A2 = SbF₃. A1 would be a higher fluoride. The most common higher fluoride is SbF₅. The decomposition would be SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂.\n\nLet's proceed with the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis, as it is more plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, A5**\n\n*   **Y = Sb** (Antimony)\n*   **A2 = SbF₃** (from mass percentage).\n*   **A1**: Decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This implies A1 is SbF₅. However, the problem describes A1 as \"bright-red\" and unstable at 293 K (20 °C). SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid. This is a significant inconsistency in the problem statement, but SbF₅ is the only logical candidate for A1 based on the decomposition products.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb + F₂ -> A3) and interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ or SbF₅. SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, known to react with xenon fluorides. So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: These are involved in the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y to A4. The reaction occurs in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n    *   The reaction is Sb + A4 -> A5. Since Sb metal (oxidation state 0) is a reactant, it will act as a reducing agent. Therefore, A4 must be an oxidizing agent, meaning it's a fluoride of antimony with a positive oxidation state (SbF₃ or SbF₅).\n    *   A reaction between Sb and SbF₃ is not expected, as Sb(0) cannot reduce Sb(III).\n    *   Therefore, A4 must be the higher fluoride, **A4 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The reaction is a comproportionation: Sb(0) + Sb(V) -> Sb(III). The product A5 would be **A5 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃. The molar ratio is 2:3, not 1:1 as stated in the problem. This is another inconsistency. However, given the other evidence, it's the most chemically sound reaction pathway.\n    *   Let's check the remaining clues: A4 (SbF₅) is a colorless liquid, so a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" is perfectly descriptive. A5 (SbF₃) hydrolyzes in water to form antimony(III) oxide and hydrofluoric acid (SbF₃ + H₂O -> Sb₂O₃ + HF), which are two substances.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the analysis, A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Let's calculate its molecular weight.\nM(A4) = M(SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F)\nM(A4) ≈ 121.76 g/mol + 5 × 19.00 g/mol\nM(A4) ≈ 121.76 + 95.00\nM(A4) ≈ 216.76 g/mol\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 216.76 g/mol. We need to find the range that contains this value.\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 216.76 g/mol is not strictly within any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range C [220-240]. The discrepancy of ~3 g/mol is likely due to flaws in the problem statement (which we have already noted regarding the properties of A1 and the 1:1 molar ratio). Among the given choices, C is by far the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most logical identification for A4 is SbF₅, with a molecular weight of approximately 217 g/mol, which falls closest to the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with the general formula YFₙ.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule (and the oxidation state of Y).\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe need to find an integer 'n' that results in the molar mass of a real element (Y) known to form at least five binary fluorides. We can test plausible values for 'n'.\n\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, K - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se - incorrect chemistry for 5 fluorides)\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb - only 2 fluorides)\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, Tl - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Pu, Am - plausible)\n\nLet's test Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol). If n=6, our estimate for M(Y) is 242.7 g/mol, which is very close to 244 g/mol.\nLet's calculate the precise ɷF for PuF₆:\nɷF(PuF₆) = (6 * 19.00) / (244 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%.\nThis value is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy is acceptable in such problems.\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that **Element Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is PuF₆**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Five Plutonium Fluorides (A1 to A5)**\n\nThe problem states there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Plutonium). Let's use the provided clues to identify them.\n\n*   **A2 = PuF₆**: As determined above. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid.\n*   **A1**: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (PuF₆) and fluorine.\" This means A1 is a higher fluoride of plutonium that is thermally unstable. This points to **A1 = PuF₈**. While extremely unstable and not a common compound, its existence as a transient species that decomposes to PuF₆ and F₂ fits the description perfectly. The \"bright-red\" color is also plausible for a high-oxidation-state compound.\n*   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" The direct fluorination of plutonium metal (Y) typically yields **A3 = PuF₄**. PuF₄ is a strong enough fluorinating agent to react with xenon under certain conditions (e.g., to form XeF₂).\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction where plutonium metal reduces a higher-oxidation-state plutonium fluoride. A common reaction in plutonium chemistry is the reduction of Pu(IV) by Pu(0) to form Pu(III).\n    *   Let's assume A4 is a Pu(IV) compound. The most common water-soluble Pu(IV) species is formed from PuF₄, but the solution itself would be colored. The problem states the solution of A4 is \"colorless\". This is a key hint. While most actinide ions are colored, the perplutonyl ion, [PuO₂]²⁺, where Pu is in the +6 oxidation state, is known to form nearly colorless solutions in some acids. This ion can be formed by dissolving PuF₆ (A2) in water with an oxidizing agent, or perhaps another fluoride exists that forms this ion. Let's assume A4 is a compound that provides Pu(VI) in solution. The simplest binary fluoride that could do this is PuF₆ itself. However, the problem distinguishes between A2 and A4. A more likely candidate for A4 is **plutonyl fluoride, PuO₂F₂**. This is not a *binary* compound of Y and F, which contradicts the initial statement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Perhaps the \"five binary compounds\" are the known PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆, and the unstable PuF₈.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nPu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 is PuF₄, then Pu + PuF₄ -> 2PuF₂ (not a known stable fluoride) or Pu + 3PuF₄ -> 4PuF₃. The ratio is not 1:1.\nIf A4 is PuF₆, then 2Pu + PuF₆ -> 3PuF₂ (not stable) or Pu + 2PuF₆ -> 3PuF₄. The ratio is not 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a slight inconsistency in the problem statement, possibly regarding the \"binary\" nature of all compounds or the reaction stoichiometry. However, let's focus on the most chemically sound interpretation. The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` is a comproportionation. A very common one is:\nPu(IV) + Pu(0) -> Pu(III)\n3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃ (ratio is 3:1, not 1:1)\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that the problem refers to a different element. However, the mass calculation for Pu is extremely compelling. Let's stick with Pu and assume there might be a slight inaccuracy in the problem's description of the reaction.\n\nThe most plausible set of well-known fluorides are PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆.\n*   A2 = PuF₆\n*   A1 = PuF₈ (hypothetical but fits decomposition)\n*   A3 = PuF₄ (product of direct fluorination)\n\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be assigned from the remaining fluorides, likely involving PuF₃.\nThe reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1) in solution is the main puzzle. If we assume the species in solution are ions, the reaction could be:\n2Pu³⁺ + Pu⁰ -> 3Pu²⁺ (Pu(II) is not stable in solution)\nPu⁴⁺ + Pu⁰ -> 2Pu²⁺ (not stable)\n\nLet's ignore the problematic 1:1 ratio for a moment and focus on what A4 could be. It's a fluoride of Y=Pu, and it's used in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Given that A1, A2, and A3 are already assigned to PuF₈, PuF₆, and PuF₄, the most likely candidate for A4 is **PuF₄**. While Pu(IV) solutions are typically colored, conditions might exist (complexation, high concentration in specific acids) where it's described as \"colorless\", or this could be an idealization in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nAssuming the most plausible identification based on the available information:\n*   Element Y = Plutonium (Pu)\n*   Compound A4 = Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF₄)\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of PuF₄.\n*   Molar mass of Pu ≈ 244 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of F ≈ 19 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of PuF₄ = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nMW(PuF₄) = 244 + 4 * 19\nMW(PuF₄) = 244 + 76\nMW(PuF₄) = 320 g/mol\n\nThis calculated molecular weight does not fall into any of the provided ranges. Let's re-read the problem carefully.\n\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nLet's reconsider the element. What if the element is Uranium (U, M=238)?\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n238 ≈ 40.45 * n => n = 5.88 ≈ 6.\nLet's check ɷF for UF₆:\nɷF(UF₆) = (6 * 19) / (238 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 352 ≈ 0.3239 or 32.39%.\nThis is also close to 31.96%. Uranium is famous for its fluorides (UF₃, UF₄, UF₅, UF₆).\nLet's assume Y = U.\n*   A2 = UF₆ (ɷF = 32.4%)\n*   A1 = A higher fluoride that decomposes to UF₆. (e.g., an unstable adduct)\n*   A3 = UF₆ (product of direct fluorination of U is UF₆)\n*   A4/A5 reaction: U + A4 -> A5.\n    A known reaction is U + 3UF₄ -> 4UF₃. (Not 1:1)\n    Another is U + UF₆ -> intermediate fluorides like UF₅.\n\nLet's calculate the MW of possible uranium fluorides:\n*   UF₃: 238 + 3*19 = 295\n*   UF₄: 238 + 4*19 = 314\n*   UF₅: 238 + 5*19 = 333\n*   UF₆: 238 + 6*19 = 352\n\nNone of these fit the ranges well. The initial mass calculation pointed more strongly to Pu. Let's go back to Pu and reconsider the compounds.\n\nWhat if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride? The problem says \"five binary compounds... are known\", but A4 might be something else used in the synthesis of A5. However, the question asks for the molecular weight of A4, implying it's a specific substance.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass calculation.\nM(Y) = 40.445 * n.\nLet's check n=4. M(Y) = 40.445 * 4 = 161.78. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, M=162.5).\nLet's check ɷF for DyF₄:\nɷF(DyF₄) = (4 * 19) / (162.5 + 76) = 76 / 238.5 = 0.3186. This is an excellent match to 31.96%.\nHowever, Dy is a lanthanide and its stable oxidation state is +3. DyF₄ is extremely unstable and not a common reagent. It is unlikely to be involved in this complex set of reactions.\n\nLet's try n=3. M(Y) = 40.445 * 3 = 121.335. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76).\nLet's check ɷF for SbF₃:\nɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188. This is also an excellent match.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y = Sb.\n*   Five binary fluorides? No, only SbF₃ and SbF₅ are common. This contradicts the premise.\n\nThe most plausible candidate remains Pu, despite the inconsistencies. Let's assume there is an error in the question's details (like the 1:1 ratio or the \"colorless\" solution) and proceed with the most likely identities.\nY = Pu.\nA2 = PuF₆.\nA4 = PuF₄. MW = 320 g/mol. This is not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from the answers.\nA) 110-130: e.g., KrF₂ (122), Xe (131)\nB) 140-160: e.g., BrF₅ (175), IF₃ (184) - no, IF (146), TeF₄ (204)\nC) 160-180: e.g., SbF₃ (179), BrF₅ (175)\nD) 220-240: e.g., DyF₄ (238.5), AtF₃ (267)\n\nIf A4 is SbF₃, MW = 179, which is in range C. But Sb does not have 5 fluorides.\nIf A4 is BrF₅, MW = 175, which is in range C. Let's test Y=Br.\nA2 has ɷF = 31.96%. Let's check Br fluorides.\nBrF: ɷF = 19 / 98.9 = 19.2%\nBrF₃: ɷF = 57 / 136.9 = 41.6%\nThe mass fraction doesn't match.\n\nThere must be a specific element and set of compounds intended by the problem setter. Let's reconsider the mass calculation as the most solid piece of evidence.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nThe best fits were Pu (n=6), Dy (n=4), Sb (n=3).\nOf these, only Pu has a rich fluoride chemistry approaching 5 compounds. The inconsistencies in the text (1:1 ratio, color) are likely red herrings or errors. The core identification must come from the mass fraction.\n\nLet's assume Y=Pu. The known fluorides are PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆. Let's call the unstable one PuF₈.\nA1=PuF₈, A2=PuF₆, A3=PuF₄.\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be PuF₃ and PuF₅.\nReaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4=PuF₅, Pu + PuF₅ -> ? No simple product.\nIf A4=PuF₃, this reaction doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. This is a reduction of A4. So A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5.\nLet's assume A4 = PuF₄ (Pu⁴⁺) and A5 = PuF₃ (Pu³⁺).\nThe reaction is 3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃. The problem states a 1:1 ratio, which is a mismatch. But if we ignore the stoichiometry and accept the identities, then A4 = PuF₄. MW(PuF₄) = 320. Still not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial calculation. What if the element is Krypton?\nY = Kr, M=83.8.\nA2 = KrF₂. ɷF = (2*19)/(83.8+38) = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y = Kr.\n*   Five binary compounds? No, only KrF₂ is well-established. KrF₄ is disputed. This premise fails.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This would make A1 = KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and can decompose to KrF₂ + F₂.\n*   A1 (KrF₄) oxidizes Xenon. Yes, KrF₄ would be a powerful oxidizer.\n*   A3 (also a Kr fluoride) interacts with Xenon.\n*   A4? A5? Reaction Kr + A4 -> A5? This chemistry is not established.\n\nThis path seems unlikely due to the \"five compounds\" rule. The problem seems to be constructed around a specific, perhaps obscure, chemical system, or it contains significant errors.\n\nLet's revisit the SbF₃ possibility. MW=179, fits range C.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF₃. ɷF=31.88% (excellent fit).\nLet's try to make the rest of the story work, ignoring the \"five fluorides\" rule.\n*   A2 = SbF₃.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This means A1 = SbF₅. SbF₅ is a liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" and it doesn't decompose to SbF₃ + F₂ at 293K. It's quite stable. This path fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the molecular weight of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.\nIf the answer is C (160-180), then A4 could be SbF₃ (179) or BrF₅ (175). We've shown that the chemistry for Y=Sb and Y=Br doesn't fit the description of A1/A2.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the mass fraction for A2.\nIf Y=Br, and A4=BrF₅ (MW=175, range C), what could A2 be?\nA2 = BrF₃? ɷF=41.6%. Too far from 31.96%.\nA2 = BrF? ɷF=19.2%. Too far.\n\nThis problem is highly ambiguous or contains errors. However, a choice must be made. The calculation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n is the most quantitative clue. The fits for Sb (n=3) and Dy (n=4) are mathematically excellent.\n*   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. Then A4 could be SbF₅. MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5*19 = 216.76. This is not in the ranges.\n*   If Y=Dy, A2=DyF₄. Then A4 could be DyF₃. MW(DyF₃) = 162.5 + 3*19 = 219.5. This is close to range D.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio).\nDy + A4 -> A5. If A4 is a higher fluoride, this is a reduction. But Dy's most stable state is +3. A reduction of Dy(IV) to Dy(III) is plausible.\nLet A4 = DyF₄. Let A5 = DyF₃.\nReaction: Dy + 3DyF₄ -> 4DyF₃. The ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, let's reconsider the most famous series of fluorides: Iodine.\nY=I. M=126.9.\nM(Y) = 40.45 * n => 126.9 = 40.45 * n => n=3.13.\nA2 could be IF₃. ɷF(IF₃) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 31.0%. This is a decent fit.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y=I.\n*   Five binary compounds? Yes: IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇ are known.\n*   A2 = IF₃.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (IF₃) and F₂. So A1 = IF₅. IF₅ is a colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\". It doesn't decompose this way at 293K. This path fails.\n\nLet's go back to the best numerical fit that isn't a lanthanide: Antimony (Sb).\nY=Sb, A2=SbF₃, ɷF=31.88%.\nLet's assume the problem creator took liberties with the chemical properties.\nA2 = SbF₃.\nA1 = SbF₅. (Let's ignore that it's stable and not red).\nA3 = SbF₅ (product of fluorination of Sb).\nReaction: Sb + A4 -> A5.\nA4 must be SbF₅. A5 must be SbF₃.\nReaction: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃. The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF₅, its MW is 216.8 g/mol. Not in the options.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF₃, its MW is 178.8 g/mol. This is in range C (160-180).\nBut if A4=SbF₃, the reaction Sb + SbF₃ -> A5 makes no sense.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. It's in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could mean the solvent is part of the reaction. For example, in HF.\nSbF₅ in HF is a superacid, H₂F⁺[SbF₆]⁻.\nLet's assume the system is Antimony. A4 has a MW in one of the ranges. The only plausible candidate is SbF₃ with MW=179. Let's select this and acknowledge the inconsistencies. If A4 is SbF₃, its molecular weight is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Identify Y and A2: The calculation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n points strongly to Sb (n=3) or Dy (n=4).\n2.  Test Y=Sb: A2=SbF₃. ɷF is a near-perfect match.\n3.  Identify A4: The other stable fluoride is SbF₅. MW=217. Not in options. The only Sb fluoride whose MW is in an option range is SbF₃ (MW=179, range C).\n4.  Conclusion: Despite the narrative part of the problem being inconsistent with the chemistry of antimony (number of fluorides, properties of A1, reaction stoichiometry), the numerical data (mass fraction) points strongly to A2=SbF₃. If we are forced to choose one of the fluorides of Sb as A4, and its MW must fit an option, the only possibility is A4=SbF₃. This creates a contradiction where A2=A4, but it's the only path that aligns the numerical data with the multiple-choice options.\n\nTherefore, based on the molecular weight calculation, A4 is likely SbF₃.\nMW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.75 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires careful deduction from the given clues. Several apparent contradictions in the problem statement (regarding colors, stability, and the number of compounds) are characteristic of advanced chemistry problems, designed to test understanding of chemical principles over rote memorization. The most consistent solution identifies the element Y as Krypton.\n\nHere is the step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2**: The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. The formula for a binary fluoride is YF_n. The molar mass of Y can be calculated using the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n    This rearranges to M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\n    Testing plausible integer values for n (the oxidation state):\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Krypton (Kr), which is 83.8 g/mol.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is a close match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This matches well with Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol) and Neptunium (Np, 237 g/mol).\n\n    While other elements provide good matches, they lead to significant chemical contradictions later on. The Krypton hypothesis, despite some inconsistencies in the problem's descriptive data, provides the most coherent pathway. Let's proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds**:\n    *   **A2**: With Y=Kr and n=2, A2 is **KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride). The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content. The next known fluoride of krypton is **KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride). The decomposition reaction is KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂. The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance,\" which is a known inaccuracy in this classic problem; KrF₄ is a colorless (or white) solid. A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent and is known to oxidize xenon.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Krypton) and also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of krypton typically produces KrF₂. KrF₂ is a strong oxidizing agent that reacts with xenon. Therefore, A3 is also **KrF₂**.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: These are identified through the reaction: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** fits this description perfectly (1 mole of Kr reacts with 1 mole of KrF₄).\n        *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **Final check on A5**: The last clue states that A5 decomposes in water. A5 is identified as KrF₂, which readily hydrolyzes in water.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    *   Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   The molecular weight is calculated as: M(Kr) + 4 * M(F).\n    *   Using the atomic weights, M(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Range**:\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   This value falls within the range of 140-160.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from A2:**\n    *   A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)), where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y): M(Y) = (n * M(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF.\n    *   Plugging in the values: M(Y) = (n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   We test plausible integer values for 'n' (oxidation state):\n        *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF is not the common fluoride).\n        *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but also very close to Krypton, M(Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check KrF₂. The fluorine percentage in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close.\n        *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony).\n        *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol.\n        *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n        *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of A1:**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance. While many fluorides are colorless, some, like dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂) and chromyl fluoride (CrO₂F₂), are reddish.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (F₂). This indicates A1 is unstable at room temperature and has a higher fluorine content than A2. The reaction is: A1 → A2 + F₂.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. This points to A1 being an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, more so than xenon difluoride. Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is known to oxidize xenon to xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    *   The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon strongly suggests that element Y might be Krypton (Kr). Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is one of the most powerful known fluorinating agents.\n    *   If Y is Krypton, then A2 would be KrF₂. However, the mass percentage calculation (31.2%) is not a perfect match for the given 31.96%. Let's re-examine the decomposition.\n    *   The decomposition is A1 → A2 + F₂. If A2 is KrF₂, then A1 must be KrF₄.\n    *   Let's check the properties of KrF₄. It is a white crystalline solid that is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature. This fits the description of A1's instability. The decomposition reaction would be KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂.\n    *   Now, let's re-evaluate A2. The problem states A2 has ɷF=31.96%. If A1 is KrF₄, then A2 is KrF₂. The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%. The discrepancy might be due to experimental data variations in the problem statement, but Krypton fits the chemical properties described far better than any other element.\n    *   Let's assume Y is Krypton.\n        *   **A1**: KrF₄ (Krypton tetrafluoride). Although described as a white solid, its extreme reactivity and instability could align with the problem's description. It decomposes into KrF₂ and F₂.\n        *   **A2**: KrF₂ (Krypton difluoride). It is a powerful oxidizing agent. Its molar mass is approximately 121.8 g/mol.\n    *   **A3**: The problem states A3 can also interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorination of Y. This is consistent with KrF₂, which is made from Kr and F₂ and reacts with xenon. So, A3 is also KrF₂.\n    *   The problem mentions \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" For Krypton, while KrF₂ is well-established, KrF₄ is theoretically predicted and its synthesis has been claimed but not definitively confirmed. Other compounds like KrF and KrF₆ are hypothetical or only exist under extreme conditions. The \"five compounds\" might refer to KrF₂, KrF₄, and cationic/complex species like KrF⁺, Kr₂F₃⁺, and [KrF⁺][SbF₆⁻]. This part of the prompt is slightly ambiguous but doesn't prevent solving the core problem.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y (Krypton) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n    *   This points towards a clathrate compound. Clathrates are substances where one type of molecule is trapped within the crystal lattice of another. Krypton is known to form clathrates with water and other molecules like hydroquinone and phenol.\n    *   Let's assume A4 is a substance that can form a clathrate with Krypton. Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂) is a classic example.\n    *   **A4**: Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂). It is a colorless solid and forms solutions.\n    *   **A5**: Krypton-hydroquinone clathrate. The general formula is [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr. This is formed by adding Krypton to a solution of hydroquinone.\n    *   When this clathrate (A5) is placed in water, it decomposes back into its constituent parts: Krypton gas and a solution of hydroquinone. These are the \"two substances.\"\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   A4 has been identified as hydroquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₄(OH)₂.\n    *   Molar Mass Calculation:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 * 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 6 * 1.01 g/mol = 6.06 g/mol\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n        *   Total Molar Mass = 72.06 + 6.06 + 32.00 = **110.12 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (110.12 g/mol) falls within the range of 110-130.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula of a binary fluoride can be represented as YFₙ or YₘFₙ. Let's test the simple case first: A2 = YFₙ.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Ar). Not suitable.\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br, Se). Does not form 5 fluorides with the required properties.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Sb). Antimony's mass is 121.76. This is a good match. However, Sb only forms two well-known fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) and the reaction chemistry described does not fit well.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (Pu, Am). Plutonium (M=244) is a good candidate. However, this leads to a molecular weight for A4 that does not match any of the options.\n\n    Let's test the case where A2 = Y₂Fₙ.\n    ɷF = (n × 19) / (2 × M(Y) + n × 19) = 0.3196\n    19n = 0.3196 × (2 × M(Y) + 19n)\n    19n = 0.6392 × M(Y) + 6.0724n\n    12.9276n = 0.6392 × M(Y)\n    M(Y) ≈ 20.22n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 20.22 × 5 = 101.1 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Ruthenium (Ru)**, which has a molar mass of 101.07 g/mol.\n    *   Let's check: If Y=Ru, and A2 = Ru₂F₅, the mass fraction of fluorine is (5 × 19) / (2 × 101.07 + 5 × 19) = 95 / (202.14 + 95) = 95 / 297.14 ≈ 0.3197 or 31.97%. This is a nearly perfect match for the given 31.96%.\n\n2.  **Verify the other clues with Y = Ruthenium (Ru).**\n    *   **Five binary compounds:** Ruthenium is known to form RuF₃, RuF₄, RuF₅, RuF₆, and the mixed-valence compound Ru₂F₅. This fits the clue.\n    *   **A1 decomposition:** A1 decomposes into A2 (Ru₂F₅) and fluorine. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than A2. A plausible candidate for A1 is RuF₆, which is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K). The reaction could be 4RuF₆ → 2Ru₂F₅ + 7F₂.\n    *   **A1 properties:** A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes xenon. RuF₆ is a very strong oxidizing agent and is one of the few substances that can oxidize xenon. Its color is described as dark-brown, which is a discrepancy, but chemical problem color descriptions can be imprecise.\n    *   **A3 properties:** A3 also interacts with xenon and is made by fluorinating Ru. This could be RuF₅ or RuF₆, both of which are strong oxidizing agents.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    *   The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y (Ru) and A4.\n    *   This is a synproportionation reaction. Let A4 = RuFₙ. The general form of the reaction for a 1:1 ratio is Ru + RuFₙ → 2RuFₘ, which requires n=2m for the stoichiometry to balance.\n    *   Let's test possible candidates for A4 from the list of Ru fluorides, where n is an even number:\n        *   If A4 = RuF₆ (n=6), then m=3, and A5 = RuF₃.\n        *   If A4 = RuF₄ (n=4), then m=2, and A5 = RuF₂.\n    *   Now we use the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n        *   If A5 = RuF₃, it is largely insoluble and stable in water, though it might hydrolyze. This is a weak fit for \"decomposes\".\n        *   If A5 = RuF₂, Ru(II) is unstable in aqueous solution and would readily disproportionate. A likely reaction is 3RuF₂ → 2RuF₃ + Ru. This produces two distinct substances (ruthenium(III) fluoride and ruthenium metal). This is a perfect fit for the clue.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Calculation.**\n    The most consistent scenario is:\n    *   Y = Ru\n    *   A4 = RuF₄\n    *   A5 = RuF₂\n    The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of A4.\n    A4 is RuF₄.\n    M(A4) = M(Ru) + 4 × M(F)\n    M(A4) = 101.07 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) = 101.07 + 76.00 = 177.07 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 177.07 g/mol falls within the range:\n    B) 160-180\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF&#x208_n) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The mass percentage can be expressed as:\n    `%F = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F) * 100`\n    Where `M_Y` is the atomic mass of element Y, `M_F` is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and `n` is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `M_Y`:\n    `M_Y = (n * M_F * (100 - %F)) / %F`\n    `M_Y = (n * 19.00 * (100 - 31.96)) / 31.96`\n    `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`\n\n    We can test integer values for `n` to find a plausible element Y:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (resembles Calcium)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (resembles Bromine)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 (resembles Antimony, Sb, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25\n\n    The best fit is for n=3, where Y is Antimony (Sb). Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃):\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100 = 31.89%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify substances A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (`A1 -> SbF₃ + F₂`). This indicates A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, which is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). A1 also oxidizes xenon, a known property of strong fluorinating agents like SbF₅ (`2SbF₅ + Xe -> [XeF][Sb₂F₁₁]`). While pure SbF₅ is colorless, the color mentioned might be due to impurities or specific conditions. The low decomposition temperature suggests high reactivity.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating antimony (`Sb + F₂ -> A3`) and also reacts with xenon. The fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ and then SbF₅. Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be the stronger oxidant, **SbF₅**. Thus, A1 and A3 are the same substance.\n\n3.  **Identify substances A4 and A5.**\n    *   The problem states that A5 is obtained by adding Y (Antimony, Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio (`Sb + A4 -> A5`).\n    *   This is a reaction where elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) is added to a solution of another antimony compound (A4). This strongly suggests an oxidation-reduction reaction, where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must be an oxidizing agent.\n    *   In this chemical system, the oxidizing species would be Antimony(V). The most likely candidates for A4 are therefore SbF₅ or a related compound.\n    *   The description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" points towards Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆), which is a superacid formed by mixing SbF₅ with hydrogen fluoride (HF). It exists as a colorless solution.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the possible candidates for A4 against the given options:\n        *   **SbF₃**: 178.76 g/mol. This falls into range A (160-180). However, A4 must be an oxidant for Sb(0), making Sb(III)F₃ a chemically inconsistent choice.\n        *   **SbF₅**: 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the ranges.\n        *   **HSbF₆**: 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol. This molecular weight falls perfectly within **range B (220-240)**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on its chemical role as an oxidant for elemental antimony and its description as a colorless solution, combined with the molecular weight calculation, A4 is identified as Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆). The product A5 would be a compound of Antimony(III), likely SbF₃, which is known to decompose in water into two substances (e.g., SbOF and HF). The molecular weight of A4 (HSbF₆) is approximately 237 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can set up an equation to find the atomic weight of Y (Ar(Y)) in terms of n (the number of fluorine atoms).\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    where Ar(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    By rearranging the formula, we get:\n    Ar(Y) = n * (19.00 * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196) ≈ n * 40.45\n\n2.  **Test Plausible Candidates for Y:** We will test small integer values for `n` to find an element Y whose atomic weight matches the calculated Ar(Y).\n    *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca, but CaF₂ has ɷF=48.7%)\n    *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br, but bromine fluorides don't match ɷF)\n    *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35. This is very close to Antimony (Sb), which has Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   Other candidates (like Pu for n=6) fit the mass percentage but are eliminated by other clues. For instance, the problem states A4 is part of a \"colorless concentrated solution\". Plutonium fluorides are all colored, which rules out Pu as element Y.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify Y as Antimony (Sb) and A2 as SbF₃.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4:** The problem states that A4 is a binary compound of Y (Sb) and fluorine, and it forms a colorless solution. The common binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ (white/colorless solid) and SbF₅ (colorless solid/liquid). So, A4 must be one of these two.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Options:** We will calculate the molecular weights of our two candidates for A4 and see which one fits the given ranges.\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = Ar(Sb) + 3 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with Given Ranges:**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 220-240\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range C (160-180). The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the ranges (it is close to, but outside of, range D).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the evidence, A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight falls in the range of 160-180. The other pieces of information in the problem (regarding substance A1 and the 1:1 reaction) seem to contain contradictions or refer to highly unusual chemistry, but the identification of A4 is robust based on the mass percentage and molecular weight options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify element Y and substance A2\n# Let Ar_Y be the atomic weight of element Y, and Ar_F be the atomic weight of Fluorine.\n# Let n be the number of fluorine atoms in A2.\n# The mass percentage of Fluorine in A2 is 31.96% or 0.3196.\n# 0.3196 = (n * Ar_F) / (Ar_Y + n * Ar_F)\nAr_F = 19.00\nw_F = 0.3196\n\n# Rearranging the formula to solve for Ar_Y:\n# Ar_Y = n * Ar_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n# Let's calculate the factor for n\nfactor = Ar_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n\n# Let's test integer values for n\n# n = 1: Ar_Y = 1 * factor\n# n = 2: Ar_Y = 2 * factor\n# n = 3: Ar_Y = 3 * factor\nn = 3\nAr_Y_calculated = n * factor\n# This calculated atomic weight is very close to Antimony (Sb), Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol.\n# So we conclude Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Identify A4 and calculate molecular weights.\n# A4 is a colorless binary fluoride of Antimony.\n# The possibilities are SbF3 and SbF5.\nAr_Sb = 121.76\n\n# Calculate MW of SbF3\nmw_sbf3 = Ar_Sb + 3 * Ar_F\n\n# Calculate MW of SbF5\nmw_sbf5 = Ar_Sb + 5 * Ar_F\n\n# Step 5 & 6: Compare with options and conclude.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (110, 130),\n    \"B\": (140, 160),\n    \"C\": (160, 180),\n    \"D\": (220, 240)\n}\n\nprint(f\"Based on mass percentage, element Y is likely Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated atomic weight for Y (with n=3) is {Ar_Y_calculated:.2f} g/mol, which is close to Ar(Sb) = {Ar_Sb} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nA4 is a colorless fluoride of Sb, so it could be SbF3 or SbF5.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of SbF3 is {mw_sbf3:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 is {mw_sbf5:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing these with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 110-130\")\nprint(f\"B) 140-160\")\nprint(f\"C) 160-180\")\nprint(f\"D) 220-240\")\n\n# Check which range fits\nfinal_choice = \"\"\nif options[\"A\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"A\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif options[\"B\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"B\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif options[\"C\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"C\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif options[\"D\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"D\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 ({mw_sbf3:.2f}) falls into range C.\")\n\nif options[\"A\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"A\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"B\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"B\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"C\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"C\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"D\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"D\"][1]:\n    pass\nelse:\n    print(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 ({mw_sbf5:.2f}) does not fall neatly into any range.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, A4 is most likely SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180.\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}.\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Based on mass percentage, element Y is likely Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\nThe calculated atomic weight for Y (with n=3) is 121.35 g/mol, which is close to Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol.\n\nA4 is a colorless fluoride of Sb, so it could be SbF3 or SbF5.\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 is 178.76 g/mol.\nThe molecular weight of SbF5 is 216.76 g/mol.\n\nComparing these with the given options:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76) falls into range C.\nThe molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76) does not fall neatly into any range.\n\nTherefore, A4 is most likely SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180.\nThe correct option is C.\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the unknown element be Y, its molar mass be M(Y), and the formula of A2 be YFₓ. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for M(Y) in terms of x:\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00x) = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nNow, we test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible element Y.\n*   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF₂ is the common fluoride).\n*   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br).\n*   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to some lanthanides).\n*   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bismuth, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the choice of Antimony (Sb). If Y = Sb and x = 3, then A2 = SbF₃.\nLet's calculate the exact mass fraction of fluorine in SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 121.76 + 56.994 = 178.754 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This strongly suggests that Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 2: Use the chemical properties to identify other compounds (A1, A3).**\n*   \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂)\".\n    The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. By conservation of mass, A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common higher fluoride is SbF₅. So, A1 = SbF₅.\n    *Careful point:* The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" and decomposes at 293 K (20 °C). Pure SbF₅ is a colorless liquid and is stable at 293 K. This is a contradiction. In complex chemical problems, quantitative data (like mass percentage) is often more reliable than qualitative descriptions (like color), which might be simplified or contain errors. We will proceed with the identification Y=Sb based on the strong numerical evidence.\n*   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\".\n    The reaction is Sb + F₂ → A3. Direct fluorination of antimony typically produces the highest stable fluoride, which is SbF₅. So, A3 = SbF₅.\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\".\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and a powerful fluorinating agent that is known to react with xenon (e.g., to form compounds like [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻). This is consistent with A1 = A3 = SbF₅.\n\n**Step 3: Identify substance A4.**\nThe problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Sb). A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are these compounds. The main binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The other three \"known\" compounds might be less common or polymeric forms, but A4 is most likely one of the two stable fluorides.\n\nWe need to find the range in which the molecular weight (MW) of A4 falls. Let's calculate the molecular weights of our candidates for A4:\n*   MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's compare these values with the given options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within range A.\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the ranges (it is close to range B, but not within it).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that A4 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion.**\nBased on the quantitative data, the element Y is antimony (Sb). The substance A4 must be a binary fluoride of antimony. By comparing the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides with the given ranges, A4 is identified as SbF₃, whose molecular weight is approximately 179 g/mol. This value falls in the range 160-180. The information about the reaction to form A5 is complex and appears contradictory, but it is not necessary to solve for the molecular weight of A4.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial clues about Element Y and its compounds.**\n    *   There are five binary compounds of element Y with fluorine.\n    *   A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon (Xe). Xenon is a noble gas and is very unreactive. Only the most powerful oxidizing agents, typically high-oxidation state fluorides of certain elements, can react with it. This strongly suggests that Y is a platinum-group metal (like Ru, Rh, Pt) or an actinide (like U, Pu).\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K. This low decomposition temperature is characteristic of unstable, high-oxidation state compounds.\n\n2.  **Identify Element Y using the composition of A2.**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F2). This means A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. The reaction is: YF_x -> YF_y + (x-y)/2 F2, where A1 = YF_x and A2 = YF_y.\n    *   The mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n (for simplicity, we can use an empirical formula). The atomic mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    *   0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    *   Solving for M(Y):\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19 = n * 19\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19 - 0.3196 * n * 19\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = (1 - 0.3196) * n * 19\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = 0.6804 * n * 19\n        *   M(Y) = (0.6804 / 0.3196) * 19 * n\n        *   M(Y) ≈ 2.1289 * 19 * n ≈ 40.45 * n\n    *   We need to find an element Y and an integer n such that M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   Let's test our candidate elements:\n        *   Ruthenium (Ru): M(Ru) ≈ 101.1 g/mol. Then n = 101.1 / 40.45 ≈ 2.5. This suggests the empirical formula of A2 is YF_2.5, or Y2F5. Let's check the mass fraction for Ru2F5: ɷF = (5 * 19) / (2 * 101.1 + 5 * 19) = 95 / (202.2 + 95) = 95 / 297.2 ≈ 0.31965 or 31.965%. This is an excellent match.\n        *   Plutonium (Pu): M(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol. Then n = 244 / 40.45 ≈ 6.03. This suggests A2 is PuF6. Let's check the mass fraction for PuF6: ɷF = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is also a good match.\n\n3.  **Choose between Ruthenium (Ru) and Plutonium (Pu) by checking the molar mass of A4.**\n    *   The problem asks for the molar mass range of A4, which is another fluoride of Y.\n    *   **If Y is Pu:** The known fluorides are PuF3 (M≈301), PuF4 (M≈320), PuF6 (M≈358). None of these molar masses fall into the given answer choices (A: 140-160, B: 110-130, C: 160-180, D: 220-240). Therefore, Y is not Plutonium.\n    *   **If Y is Ru:** The known fluorides are RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, RuF6. Let's calculate their molar masses.\n        *   M(RuF3) = 101.1 + 3 * 19 = 158.1 g/mol. This falls in range **A) 140-160**.\n        *   M(RuF4) = 101.1 + 4 * 19 = 177.1 g/mol. This falls in range **C) 160-180**.\n        *   M(RuF5) = 101.1 + 5 * 19 = 196.1 g/mol.\n        *   M(RuF6) = 101.1 + 6 * 19 = 215.1 g/mol.\n    *   So, A4 must be either RuF3 or RuF4.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 using the reaction to form A5.**\n    *   The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This describes the reaction: Y + A4 → A5.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction, where element Y in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of Y in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form a product (A5) with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test the possibilities for A4:\n        *   **If A4 is RuF3 (Ru is +3):** The reaction is `Ru(0) + RuF3 -> ...`. A 1:1 molar ratio would lead to a product with an average oxidation state of +1.5, for example, `Ru2F3`. This is not a simple, common fluoride of ruthenium.\n        *   **If A4 is RuF4 (Ru is +4):** The reaction is `Ru(0) + RuF4 -> ...`. A 1:1 molar ratio leads to a product with an average oxidation state of +2. A balanced reaction is: `Ru + RuF4 → 2 RuF2`. This is a chemically plausible reaction, forming Ruthenium(II) fluoride.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidate for A4 is RuF4.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   Element Y is Ruthenium (Ru).\n    *   Compound A4 is Ruthenium(IV) fluoride (RuF4).\n    *   The molar mass of RuF4 is M(RuF4) = 101.1 + 4 * 19.00 = 177.1 g/mol.\n    *   This molar mass falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests that element Y is Plutonium (Pu). The calculated atomic weight based on the mass fraction of fluorine in A2 (ɷF=31,96%) points towards Pu when the number of fluorine atoms is 6. The mass fraction of fluorine in PuF6 is approximately 31.84%, which is very close to the given value. Plutonium is also known to form multiple binary fluorides and its compounds are strong oxidizing agents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues and search results:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and A2**:\n    *   A2 is a binary fluoride of Y (YF_n) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    *   The atomic weight of Y can be expressed as Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   For n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu, Ar ≈ 244 g/mol).\n    *   Let's verify with Y = Pu and n = 6. A2 would be PuF6. The molar mass of PuF6 is 244 + 6 * 19 = 358 g/mol. The mass fraction of fluorine is (6 * 19) / 358 ≈ 31.84%. This is a strong match.\n    *   Therefore, **Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the five binary compounds**:\n    *   Plutonium is known to form several binary fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, and PuF6.\n    *   A fifth compound, PuF8, has been studied theoretically and is predicted to be unstable, decomposing to PuF6 and F2.\n    *   The five known binary compounds are likely **PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, and the theoretically known PuF8**.\n\n3.  **Identify A1**:\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance. PuF6 is a reddish-brown solid.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20°C) into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is A1 → PuF6 + F2.\n    *   This decomposition reaction points to A1 being **Plutonium octafluoride (PuF8)**. Theoretical calculations show that PuF8 is expected to decompose into PuF6 and F2.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. PuF6 is already an extremely strong oxidizing agent capable of this. PuF8 would be an even stronger oxidizing agent, consistent with this property.\n\n4.  **Identify A3**:\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Pu) with fluorine.\n    *   The direct fluorination of plutonium can yield PuF4 or PuF6 depending on the conditions.\n    *   A3 can also interact with xenon, implying it is a strong oxidizing agent. Both PuF4 (under harsh conditions) and PuF6 can react with or be catalysts for reactions involving xenon compounds. Given the context of powerful fluorinating agents, **A3 is most likely PuF6**, formed by the aggressive fluorination of plutonium metal.\n\n5.  **Identify A4 and A5**:\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y (Pu metal) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\n    *   Let's examine plutonium oxyfluorides, which can be formed from reactions involving plutonium fluorides and an oxygen source (like water in a \"solution\").\n    *   A key reaction is the hydrolysis of plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6) in water, which produces plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). The reaction is: PuF6 + 2H2O → PuO2F2 + 4HF.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **A4 is Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2)**.\n    *   The problem states A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". PuO2F2 can be handled in solution.\n    *   The reaction to form A5 is: Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n        Pu + PuO2F2 → A5\n    *   This suggests a comproportionation reaction. Plutonium is in the 0 oxidation state, and in PuO2F2, it is in the +6 oxidation state. A reaction between them could yield an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Pu(0) + Pu(VI)O2F2 → 2 Pu(III)OF?\n    *   A known, stable plutonium oxyfluoride is **PuOF** (plutonium(III) oxyfluoride). So, the reaction could be: Pu + PuO2F2 → 2PuOF. This fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants Pu and PuO2F2 to form the product A5 (PuOF).\n    *   Therefore, **A5 is Plutonium(III) oxyfluoride (PuOF)**.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 (PuOF) decomposes in water into two substances. PuOF does not dissolve in water but would likely react/decompose under certain conditions, potentially forming Pu(OH)3 and HF, or other plutonium oxide/hydroxide species and fluoride ions.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4**:\n    *   Based on the deductions above, **A4 is Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2)**.\n    *   We need to calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of PuO2F2 = 244 + (2 * 16) + (2 * 19) = 244 + 32 + 38 = 314 g/mol.\n\n7.  **Re-evaluating A4 and A5 with another possibility**:\n    *   Let's reconsider the reaction for A5. What if A4 is a plutonium fluoride in solution?\n    *   PuF6 (A2 or A3) reacts violently with water, so a \"solution of A4\" is less likely to be PuF6.\n    *   Could A4 be PuF4? PuF4 is a solid. Let's assume a solution of a complex fluoride.\n    *   Let's stick with the most plausible identification from the reaction stoichiometry.\n    *   The identification of A4 as PuO2F2 seems the most chemically sound. However, the molecular weight of 314 g/mol does not fall into any of the given ranges. This indicates an error in my deduction or an issue with the problem statement/options.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nWhat if Y is not Pu? Let's reconsider Krypton (Kr).\n*   Y = Kr, A2 = KrF2. ɷF = 31.2%, close but not as close as Pu.\n*   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a major problem for Krypton. Only KrF2 is well-established.\n*   The high reactivity and colors are more consistent with a heavy element like Plutonium.\n\nLet's re-examine the compounds of Plutonium.\nPuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuF8.\nA1: PuF8\nA2: PuF6\nA3: PuF6\n\n\"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nWhat if A4 is not a plutonium compound but the solvent? The wording \"solution of A4\" makes this unlikely. It implies A4 is the solute.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 = PuF4 (M=320 g/mol), could a solution be made? PuF4 is poorly soluble.\nIf A4 = PuO2F2 (M=314 g/mol).\nIf A5 = PuOF (M=279 g/mol). Reaction: Pu + PuO2F2 -> 2PuOF. This is balanced.\n\nLet's look at the options again.\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nNone of the plausible high-oxidation state plutonium fluorides (PuF4, PuF5, PuF6) or oxyfluorides (PuO2F2) have molecular weights in these ranges.\nPuF3: 301 g/mol\nPuF4: 320 g/mol\nPuF5: 339 g/mol\nPuF6: 358 g/mol\nPuO2F2: 314 g/mol\n\nThere must be a different interpretation. Let's reconsider Y. What if the mass percentage is for a different formula?\n\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\nIf n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35. This is close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\nLet's test Y = Sb.\n*   A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3*19)/178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n*   So, **Y = Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n*   **Five binary compounds of Sb and F?** Only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. This premise is weak for Sb as well. However, in the context of a puzzle, perhaps it refers to less stable or complex species.\n*   **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine.** A1 -> SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 is SbF5. Reaction: SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2. This decomposition is known to occur at higher temperatures, but maybe at 293K under specific conditions.\n*   **A1 (SbF5) is bright-red.** SbF5 is a colorless, viscous liquid/solid. This contradicts the \"bright-red\" description.\n*   **A1 (SbF5) oxidizes xenon.** SbF5 is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, it reacts with XeF2 to form salts. Plausible.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine.** Sb + F2 -> SbF5. So **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A3 (SbF5) can also interact with xenon.** Yes, this is correct.\n*   **A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.**\n    Sb + A4 -> A5.\n*   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n\nNow we need to identify A4 and A5 in the antimony system. The reaction is Sb(0) + A4 -> A5. This is a comproportionation. A4 must be a compound with Sb in a positive oxidation state. The most likely candidate for A4 is SbF5, and for A5 is SbF3.\nReaction: 2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. The molar ratio is not 1:1.\n\nLet's reconsider the plutonium hypothesis, as the chemistry seems more consistent despite the molecular weight mismatch. Is there any other compound that could be A4?\n\nPerhaps A4 is not a plutonium compound. The problem states a \"solution of A4\". What if A4 is an acid?\n\"adding Y (Pu) ... to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"\nMaybe A4 is an acid like HClO4 or H2SO4. This seems unlikely as it deviates from the \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\" theme.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my chain of logic for Pu and re-examine the molecular weights of *all* possible compounds.\nPuF3 = 301.06\nPuF4 = 320.06\nPuF5 = 339.05\nPuF6 = 358.05\nPuOF = 279.06\nPuO2F2 = 314.05\nPuF8 = 396.04\n\nNone of these fit. Let's reconsider Y = Kr.\nKrF2 = 121.8. This fits in range C (110-130). Could A4 be KrF2?\nA2 was KrF2. A3 could be KrF2. Let's test if A4 is KrF2.\n*   Y = Krypton (Kr)\n*   A2 = KrF2 (ɷF ≈ 31.2%, close to 31.96%).\n*   A1 = KrF4 (decomposes to KrF2 + F2).\n*   A3 = KrF2 (from Kr + F2).\n*   A4 = KrF2.\n*   Reaction to get A5: Y(Kr) + A4(KrF2) -> A5. (1:1 molar ratio). Kr + KrF2 -> A5. This reaction doesn't seem to lead to a known stable product.\n*   Also, the \"five binary compounds\" issue persists.\n\nThere seems to be a significant inconsistency in the problem statement, the options, and known chemistry. However, let's revisit the first deduction, which had the best fit for the mass percentage.\nY = Pu, A2 = PuF6.\nLet's assume my identification of A4 is wrong and that A4's molecular weight *must* fall into one of the ranges. Let's look for any other plausible compound.\n\nWhat if \"binary compounds\" includes oxyfluorides? This is a stretch of the definition, but possible in a puzzle context.\nThe five compounds could be: PuF4, PuF6, PuOF, PuO2F2, and another one.\n\nLet's work backward from the answers.\nA) 140-160: ?\nB) 160-180: ? Could match SbF3 (178.76). But the red color of A1 (SbF5) is wrong.\nC) 110-130: ? Could match KrF2 (121.8). But \"five compounds\" is wrong.\nD) 220-240: ?\n\nLet's try one more element. Y=Ruthenium (Ru). Ar(Ru) = 101.07.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n101.07 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 2.5. Doesn't fit well.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Pu and assume A4 is an unusual species or there's a typo in the problem.\nIf A4 had to be in one of those ranges, which part of my deduction is most likely wrong? The identification of A4=PuO2F2 is based on interpreting the formation of A5.\nPu + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nLet's rethink. If A4 is PuF4 (MW=320), the reaction could be: Pu + 3PuF4 -> 4PuF3. Ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\nIf A4 is PuF6 (MW=358), the reaction could be: 2Pu + PuF6 -> 3PuF2 (hypothetical) or other mixtures. 2Pu + PuF6 -> 3PuF4 is not balanced. Pu + 2PuF6 -> 3PuF4. Not 1:1.\n\nThe reaction `Pu + PuO2F2 → 2PuOF` is stoichiometrically sound (1:1) and involves known (though perhaps uncommon) species. The MW of PuO2F2 is 314. This is outside all ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider the question's source. It might be from a specific curriculum or competition where certain non-standard facts are assumed. Is there any other interpretation of \"five binary compounds\"? Maybe it includes anions like PuF7^- or PuF8^2-? But these are not binary compounds *of fluorine with element Y*.\n\nGiven the contradictions, let's review the most solid piece of evidence: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n leading to Y=Pu and A2=PuF6. The chemical properties align well with Plutonium.\n- Five fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuF8).\n- A1(PuF8) -> A2(PuF6) + F2.\n- Strong oxidizer, reacts with Xenon (PuF6, PuF8).\n- A3 (PuF6) from fluorination of Pu.\n- A5 from Pu + A4.\n\nThe problem seems to hinge on identifying A4. All evidence points to A4 being PuO2F2, but its molecular weight (314) doesn't fit the options. Let's re-read again. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2) is a solid. It can be formed from hydrolysis of PuF6. Perhaps it forms a complex in solution.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and my identification of A4=PuO2F2 is correct, and the question is flawed. But I must choose an answer.\nIs there any other possibility for Y?\nY = Technetium (Tc), Ar = 98. 98 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 2.42. No.\nY = Neptunium (Np), Ar = 237. 237 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 5.86. This is also very close to n=6. Let's test Y = Np.\n*   A2 = NpF6. M(NpF6) = 237 + 6*19 = 351 g/mol.\n    ɷF(NpF6) = (6*19)/351 = 114/351 ≈ 32.48%. This is also close to 31.96%.\n*   Neptunium chemistry is similar to Plutonium. It forms NpF3, NpF4, NpF5, NpF6.\n*   Let's check A4, which would be NpO2F2. M(NpO2F2) = 237 + 32 + 38 = 307 g/mol. Still not in the ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider Sb. Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. MW=178.76. ɷF=31.88%. This is a very good fit.\nA1 is bright-red. SbF5 is colorless. This is the main contradiction. If we ignore the color, does the rest fit?\n- A1(SbF5) -> A2(SbF3) + F2. (Decomposition).\n- A1(SbF5) oxidizes Xe. Plausible.\n- A3 is SbF5 (from Sb + F2).\n- A3(SbF5) interacts with Xe. Plausible.\n- Reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\n- What could A4 and A5 be? Maybe A4 is an antimony oxyfluoride. Or maybe the reaction is different. What about addition? Sb + SbF3 -> Sb2F3? Not a simple compound.\n- SbF5 is A3. Could A4 also be SbF5? Reaction: Sb + SbF5 -> ? Does not seem to be a simple 1:1 reaction.\n\nIf we assume Y=Sb, then A2=SbF3 has a molecular weight of ~179. This is in range B. If we assume A4 is A2, this could be the answer. But there is no reason to assume A4 is A2. The color mismatch for A1 is also a strong counterargument.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. It seems the most likely candidate for Y, and the chemistry fits well, except for the final step matching the options. There must be a mistake in the problem's data or options. Let me assume my identification of A4 is wrong, and one of the other Pu-F compounds is A4, and that the description of its formation is misleading. This is a weak path.\n\nLet's try a different approach. What if A5 is PuF4? Then 3Pu + Pu(X) -> 4PuF4. What if A5 is PuF3? Pu + 3A4 -> 4PuF3. If A4 is PuF4, then Pu + 3PuF4 -> 4PuF3. Ratio 1:3.\n\nThis problem is very difficult due to the inconsistencies. Let me reconsider the calculation for Y.\nAr(Y) = 40.449 * n.\nn=1, Ar=40.4 (Ca)\nn=2, Ar=80.9 (Br) -> BrF. ɷF = 19 / (79.9+19) = 19.2%. No. A2=BrF3. ɷF = 57 / (79.9+57) = 41.6%. No. A2=BrF5. ɷF = 95 / (79.9+95) = 47.9%. No.\nn=3, Ar=121.3 (Sb) -> SbF3. ɷF = 31.88%. Match.\nn=4, Ar=161.8 (Dy) -> DyF3. ɷF= 57 / (162.5+57) = 26%. No.\nn=5, Ar=202.2 (Hg, Tl) -> TlF3. ɷF=57 / (204.4+57) = 21.8%. No.\nn=6, Ar=242.7 (Pu) -> PuF6. ɷF = 31.84%. Match.\n\nSo it's either Sb or Pu.\nIf Y=Sb:\nA1=SbF5 (not red)\nA2=SbF3 (MW=178.8)\nA3=SbF5\nA4=? A5=?\nIf A4 were, for example, SbF3, its MW is 178.8, which is in range **B**.\n\nIf Y=Pu:\nA1=PuF8 (hypothetical, but fits decomposition)\nA2=PuF6 (MW=358.0)\nA3=PuF6\nA4=PuO2F2 (MW=314, based on reaction)\nA5=PuOF\nThis seems more chemically sound, but MW of A4 does not fit any option.\n\nLet's reconsider the Sb case. What if \"bright-red\" is a mistake in the problem? Then Y=Sb is a strong possibility. If we assume Y=Sb, then what is A4? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 can be a colorless liquid. Reaction: Sb + SbF5 (1:1). A known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. Maybe there's another reaction, or the stoichiometry is a red herring. What if A5 is a complex salt? If we have a solvent `solv`, maybe Sb + SbF5 + solv -> [Sb(solv)][SbF5] or something similar? This is too speculative.\nThe simplest assumption if Y=Sb is that A4 is one of the known fluorides, SbF3 or SbF5.\nMW(SbF3) = 178.8 -> Range B\nMW(SbF5) = 216.8 -> outside all ranges.\nSo, if Y=Sb, the only option that could fit is if A4 is SbF3. Let's see if the reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 makes sense. This would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is not typical.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. What if the \"five binary compounds\" include oxides? PuO, PuO2, Pu2O3, PuF4, PuF6? This violates \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\n\nWhat if the element is **Osmium (Os)**? Ar(Os) = 190.23.\n190.23 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 4.7. Maybe n=5? OsF5.\nɷF(OsF5) = (5*19)/(190.23+95) = 95/285.23 = 33.3%. Not a great fit.\nWhat about n=4? OsF4. ɷF(OsF4) = (4*19)/(190.23+76) = 76/266.23 = 28.5%. Not good.\n\nLet's trust the math. The best fits are Pu and Sb.\nPu: Fits most chemical clues, but MW of A4 doesn't match options.\nSb: Fits MW clue for A2 perfectly. One major contradiction (color of A1). The reaction for A5 is unclear. But if we assume A4 is SbF3, its MW (178.8) is in range B.\n\nThis feels like a choice between two imperfect candidates. The mass percent is a very specific number.\nɷF(SbF3) = 31.88% -> difference of |31.88 - 31.96| = 0.08\nɷF(PuF6) = 31.84% -> difference of |31.84 - 31.96| = 0.12\nThe fit for Sb is slightly better. The main obstacle is the color of SbF5. Could \"bright-red\" refer to a complex or an impure substance? It's possible. Given the options, the path with Antimony (Sb) leads to a potential answer.\nLet's assume Y = Sb.\nA2 = SbF3.\nThen A4 could also be SbF3. Molecular Weight is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nLet's try to rationalize this choice.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF3.\nA1 decomposes to SbF3 and F2 -> A1=SbF5. Let's ignore the color discrepancy for a moment.\nA1 oxidizes Xe -> SbF5 does.\nA3 from Sb + F2 -> A3=SbF5.\nA3 interacts with Xe -> SbF5 does.\nA5 from Sb + A4 (1:1). If A4 is SbF3, the reaction is Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This could form sub-fluorides like (SbF)n or clusters. It's plausible in molten salt chemistry.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF3, its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. This falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nLet's check the Plutonium path one last time. Is there any Pu compound in the ranges? No. Therefore, despite the compelling chemical arguments for Pu, it cannot lead to one of the provided answers. The Sb path, despite the color contradiction, leads to a plausible molecular weight for A4=A2=SbF3, which is 178.8 g/mol, fitting in range B. The question might be constructed such that A4 is the same as A2.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1. Identify Y from ɷF(A2). Both Sb and Pu are good candidates based on the math.\n2. Analyze chemical properties. Pu fits better overall, especially the \"five compounds\" and colors. Sb has a major color discrepancy for A1.\n3. Analyze the formation of A5. The reaction for Pu (Pu + PuO2F2) is plausible but gives MW(A4)=314, which is not an option. The reaction for Sb is less clear.\n4. Work backward from the options. Range B (160-180) perfectly contains MW(SbF3) = 178.8. If we assume A4=A2=SbF3, this path leads to an answer. No other plausible compound from either the Sb or Pu systems fits any of the other ranges.\n5. Conclusion: The most likely intended answer, despite the flaws in the problem description, is based on Y=Sb and A4=SbF3.\n\nMolecular weight of A4 = SbF3 = 121.76 + 3*18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\nThis value falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where n is the number of fluorine atoms and Y is the unknown element.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine can be expressed as:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\n    Using the atomic weight of Fluorine (Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol) and the given mass fraction (0.3196):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19)\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` (a plausible oxidation state for an element Y) that gives a realistic atomic weight Ar(Y).\n    *   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, but CaF is not a stable compound).\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br or Se).\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   If n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dy, a lanthanide).\n    *   If n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Hg, Tl, Pb).\n    *   If n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu, with Ar(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Verify the best candidates for Y.**\n    Let's check the theoretical mass fraction of fluorine for the most promising candidates:\n    *   **If Y = Sb and n = 3 (A2 = SbF₃):**\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **If Y = Pu and n = 6 (A2 = PuF₆):**\n        ɷF(PuF₆) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also very close.\n\n3.  **Use other clues to distinguish between Sb and Pu.**\n    *   The problem states \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\" This means A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2 (A1 → A2 + F₂).\n    *   If Y = Pu, then A2 = PuF₆. A1 would have to be a fluoride with more than 6 fluorine atoms (e.g., PuF₇ or PuF₈), which are not known to exist as stable compounds. This makes Plutonium an unlikely candidate.\n    *   If Y = Sb, then A2 = SbF₃. A1 could be SbF₅, which has a higher fluorine content. The decomposition would be SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂.\n\n    While the properties of A1 (bright-red, decomposes at 293 K) do not perfectly match those of SbF₅ (which is a colorless, stable liquid), the existence of a higher fluoride is chemically sound. Other clues in the problem are often more reliable than physical properties which can be misstated. The mass fraction calculation strongly points to Antimony (Sb).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    Let's assume Y is Antimony (Sb). The known binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. These, along with potential polymeric or complex forms, would constitute the \"five binary compounds\". Substance A4 must be one of these. The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of A4.\n\n    Let's calculate the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides:\n    *   **MW(SbF₃):** 121.76 + 3 * 19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   **MW(SbF₅):** 121.76 + 5 * 19 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Molecular Weight with the given ranges.**\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range A (160-180).\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any range, although it is closest to range D.\n\n    Based on the perfect fit of MW(SbF₃) into range A, it is highly probable that A4 is SbF₃. The other descriptive parts of the problem (e.g., the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) might be flawed or intended to be misleading, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. The numerical data (mass fraction and molecular weight) provide the most direct path to the solution.\n\nTherefore, the substance A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and answer the question:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 is YF_n. The molar mass of element Y (M_Y) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M_F ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the equation:\n\nM_Y = ((1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196) * n * M_F\nM_Y ≈ (0.6804 / 0.3196) * 19.00 * n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium or Argon, which are unlikely candidates).\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but BrF3 and BrF5 are the common fluorides, and their fluorine percentages do not match).\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's check the fluorine percentage in SbF3: ω(F) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element fits well).\n\nTherefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and compound **A2 is SbF3** (antimony trifluoride).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Five Binary Fluorides of Antimony\n\nAntimony is known to form several binary fluorides. The main ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a powerful Lewis acid and can accept a fluoride ion (F-) to form complex anions like [SbF6]⁻, [Sb2F11]⁻, and [Sb3F16]⁻. This suggests the five compounds are likely related to these species or polymeric forms. The known binary fluorides or fluoride adducts are SbF3, SbF5, and anions formed with SbF5, such as those in K[SbF6], K[Sb2F11], and K[Sb3F16]. While not strictly binary compounds of only Y and F in the neutral sense, in the context of this problem, the polyfluoride anions are key. A search also reveals polymeric fluorides.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Compounds A1 and A3\n\n*   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20°C) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. It also oxidizes xenon. This points to a highly reactive, unstable, high-oxidation-state fluoride. While a simple higher binary fluoride of antimony like SbF7 is not well-established, polymeric or complex fluorides can be highly reactive. The description of a bright-red solid that decomposes near room temperature and oxidizes xenon is characteristic of some extremely powerful fluorinating agents, such as dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), also known as \"FOOF\". However, the problem states these are compounds of Y and Fluorine. A compound like tetrameric ruthenium pentafluoride, (RuF5)4, is known to be a dark red solid. In the realm of antimony, there are complex polymeric fluorides, but none are commonly described as bright-red. However, given the clues, A1 must be a higher fluoride that decomposes to the more stable SbF3. The decomposition is A1 → SbF3 + F2.\n\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and can also react with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony produces antimony trifluoride (SbF3) or, with excess fluorine, antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be a very strong oxidizing agent. **SbF5** is an exceptionally strong Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing oxygen and being a component of superacids. Therefore, **A3 is SbF5**.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Compounds A4 and A5\n\nThe problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is: Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\nSubstituting Y = Sb, we have: **Sb + A4 → A5**.\n\nThis is a comproportionation reaction where antimony metal reduces a higher-oxidation-state antimony fluoride (A4) to an intermediate one (A5).\n*   **A4** must be a stable, higher-valent fluoride of antimony. The most stable and common higher fluoride is **SbF5**. SbF5 is a colorless, viscous liquid.\n*   If A4 is SbF5, the reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. For a 1:1 molar ratio to be significant, it might imply a structural change. A known reaction involves the combination of antimony species. Let's consider the oxidation states. Sb(0) + Sb(+5) → ? A likely product would be an intermediate oxidation state, which is Sb(+3). So, the product A5 should be related to SbF3. However, the stoichiometry doesn't balance for a simple redox reaction (Sb + SbF5 -> 2SbF3 is not 1:1).\n\nLet's re-examine the clue. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 is a liquid that can act as a solvent. The reaction could be forming a complex ion. A plausible reaction series is the formation of complex fluorides.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5. If A4 is SbF5, and A5 is SbF3, this doesn't fit the molar ratio.\n\nLet's look at the properties of A5. \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" SbF3 hydrolyzes, but this is a general property.\n\nLet's revisit the known fluorides and their reactions. We have identified A2=SbF3 and A3=SbF5. A1 is an unstable higher fluoride. This leaves A4 and A5.\nThe most common and stable fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5.\nIt is plausible that A4 is one of these, and A5 is another.\n\nLet's assume **A4 is SbF5**. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This doesn't lead to a simple binary compound.\nLet's assume **A4 is SbF3**. Then Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is unlikely.\n\nThere must be a different interpretation. Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. What if they are (SbF3), (SbF5), and related complex anions [Sb2F11]⁻, [Sb3F16]⁻, etc? The problem states *binary compounds*. This usually implies only two elements. The anions themselves aren't neutral compounds.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5. What if A4 is not a simple fluoride? The problem refers to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This could imply A4 is a solute.\nConsider a different reaction: The reaction between antimony trichloride and antimony trifluoride can produce antimony chloride fluoride.\n\nLet's reconsider the most straightforward interpretation:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF3\n*   A3 = SbF5\n*   A1 = An unstable higher fluoride of Sb.\n*   A4 and A5 are two other distinct binary fluorides.\n\nA known structural form of antimony pentafluoride is the tetramer, (SbF5)4. There are also polymeric forms. Let's stick with the simplest species first: SbF3 and SbF5. What could the other three be? Perhaps polymeric forms like (SbF3)n, (SbF5)n (e.g., n=4), and a mixed-valence compound. A well-known mixed-valence fluoride is Sb2F11⁻, formed from SbF5 and SbF6⁻.\n\nLet's go back to the most solid clue: A2 (ωF=31.96%) is SbF3.\nAnd A3 (strong oxidant, made by fluorinating Y) is SbF5.\nNow for the A4/A5 reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nIf A4 = SbF5, we have Sb + SbF5 -> A5. A 1:1 reaction could point to the formation of a dimeric species of an intermediate oxidation state, like [Sb-Sb]F5. This is highly speculative.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The options for the molecular weight of A4 are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weights of our candidate compounds:\n*   **SbF3**: 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n*   **SbF5**: 121.76 + 5*19.00 = 216.76 g/mol\n\nLet's analyze the ranges:\n*   A) 110-130: Doesn't match SbF3 or SbF5.\n*   B) 160-180: This range includes the molecular weight of **SbF3** (178.76 g/mol).\n*   C) 220-240: This range is slightly too high for SbF5.\n*   D) 140-160: Doesn't match SbF3 or SbF5.\n\nIf **A4 is SbF3**, its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which falls squarely in the range of 160-180. Let's see if this fits the remaining clues.\n\nIf A4 = SbF3, the reaction is: Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio, in a hot concentrated solution).\nThis is a reaction between Sb(0) and Sb(III). This is a comproportionation to a lower oxidation state, Sb(I) or Sb(II), for example, something like \"SbF\". While SbF is not a stable molecule, subhalides of antimony exist. This path seems chemically less plausible than the oxidation of Sb metal by a higher valent fluoride.\n\nLet's re-read the A4/A5 clue carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the *synthesis* of A5. A4 is the starting material.\nLet's assume there was a typo in the molecular weight ranges and A4 is SbF5 (MW = 216.76). Range C is 220-240. This is close. If A4=SbF5, then Sb + SbF5 -> A5.\n\nThere must be a key piece of information being missed or misinterpreted. Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. Rhenium, Osmium, and Ruthenium also form multiple fluorides, but the mass percentage calculation pointed strongly to Antimony.\n\nLet's trust the calculation that A2 = SbF3 (MW = 178.76).\nLet's trust the logic that A3 = SbF5 (MW = 216.76).\n\nNow, let's revisit the options and our calculated molecular weights.\n*   MW(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol -> Fits range B (160-180)\n*   MW(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol -> Does not fit any range perfectly, but is closest to C (220-240).\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb(Y) + A4 -> A5.\nThis reaction involves adding the element itself to one of its fluorides. This is a common way to produce a lower-valent halide from a higher-valent one (comproportionation).\nExample: 2 SbF5 + Sb -> (doesn't work well)\nExample: SiCl4 + Si -> 2 SiCl2 (at high temp)\nExample: PCl5 + P(red) -> PCl3 (not 1:1)\n\nThis implies that A4 has a higher oxidation state than A5. Therefore, A4 is likely SbF5. If A4=SbF5, the MW is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit any of the provided ranges well.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. What if the element Y is not Antimony?\nLet's recheck the mass percentage calculation for A2: M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n.\nIf n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (162.5) or Terbium (158.9), but they are not known for forming 5 volatile/reactive fluorides.\nIf n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is close to Bismuth (209.0). Let's check BiF5. ω(F) in BiF5 = (5 * 19) / (209 + 5*19) = 95 / 304 ≈ 31.25%. This is also a good match for 31.96%. Let's check BiF3: MW=266. BiF5: MW=304. Neither of these fit the A2 criteria.\n\nLet's return to Antimony (Sb) as the most probable identity for Y.\nA2 = SbF3 (MW ≈ 179).\nA3 = SbF5 (MW ≈ 217).\n\nLet's assume A4 is SbF3.\nMW(A4) = 178.76 g/mol. This falls in range **B) 160-180**.\nThe reaction becomes Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This is chemically strange. It would imply creating a sub-fluoride.\n\nLet's assume A4 is SbF5.\nMW(A4) = 216.76 g/mol. This is closest to range C (220-240).\nThe reaction becomes Sb + SbF5 -> A5. This is a comproportionation and is more chemically plausible. For example, it could form a mixed-valence compound.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction between the chemical logic (which suggests A4 is the higher fluoride, SbF5) and the given molecular weight ranges (where SbF3 fits perfectly into one range, while SbF5 fits poorly into another).\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement.\n*   A1: Bright-red, decomposes to A2 + F2. So A1 is a higher fluoride than A2.\n*   A2: ωF=31.96% -> SbF3.\n*   A3: Y + F2 -> A3. Reacts with Xe. -> SbF5.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\n\nThe reaction Y + A4 -> A5 strongly suggests A4 is a higher oxidation state fluoride and A5 is a lower one. So A4 should be SbF5. But its MW of 216.76 doesn't fit the ranges well.\n\nWhat if there is a mistake in my identification of A2?\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n. What if Y is Ruthenium (Ru, MW=101.1)?\nn=2 -> M_Y ≈ 80.9.\nn=3 -> M_Y ≈ 121.4.\nRuthenium forms RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, RuF6. That's four. Maybe (RuF5)4 is the fifth?\nLet's check ω(F) in RuF3: (3*19)/(101.1+57) = 57/158.1 ≈ 36.05%. Doesn't match.\nLet's check ω(F) in RuF4: (4*19)/(101.1+76) = 76/177.1 ≈ 42.9%. Doesn't match.\n\nLet's stick to Antimony. The evidence for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is strong.\nA2 = SbF3 (MW=178.76)\nA3 = SbF5 (MW=216.76)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the A4/A5 reaction. Is it possible that the roles are reversed? A4 + Y -> A5.\nMaybe A4 is a lower fluoride and it reacts with more Sb metal to form a cluster or subhalide. This is less common.\n\nLet's assume the most chemically sound process: comproportionation of a high-valent fluoride.\nA4 = SbF5. MW = 216.76. The closest range is C) 220-240. The discrepancy is about 1.5%.\nLet's assume A4 = SbF3. MW = 178.76. This fits perfectly in range B) 160-180.\nThe chemical reaction for A4=SbF3 is Sb(s) + SbF3(solution) -> A5. This is not a standard, simple reaction.\n\nHowever, in puzzle-like chemistry problems, sometimes a perfect fit for a numerical value is the intended clue, even if the associated chemistry is obscure. The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76) fits perfectly inside the 160-180 range. The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76) is outside the 220-240 range.\n\nIf we accept A4 = SbF3, then what is A5? Sb + SbF3 -> A5. And A5 decomposes in water into two substances. The nature of A5 is unclear, but we don't need to identify it, only A4.\n\nLet's weigh the evidence:\n1.  **Chemical Logic**: The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 suggests A4 is the higher-valent fluoride, SbF5.\n2.  **Numerical Fit**: The MW of SbF3 (178.76) fits perfectly in range B. The MW of SbF5 (216.76) does not fit well in any range.\n\nPerhaps the phrasing \"adding Y... to a ... solution of A4\" implies that Y is reacting with A4. It does not strictly mean A4 is the oxidant. However, it's the most common interpretation.\n\nLet's consider if the problem has a subtle trap. What if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride? The question asks for the molecular weight of \"substance A4\". For example, SbF5 can react with HF to form H[SbF6]. Could A4 be an acid? The problem says \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". H[SbF6] is not a binary compound of Sb and F.\n\nLet's go with the strongest piece of evidence, which is the numerical match.\n*   Element Y is Antimony (Sb).\n*   A2 is SbF3. Its molecular weight is ~178.8 g/mol.\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n*   Range B is 160-180 g/mol.\n*   SbF3 fits perfectly in this range.\n*   Let's hypothesize that A4 = SbF3.\n\nThe reaction is then Sb is added to a solution of SbF3 to make A5. While this is an unusual reaction, it is not impossible that it forms some sub-fluoride species A5 in solution, which then hydrolyzes. The key point is that we must identify one of the five binary compounds. SbF3 is one of them. Its molecular weight matches one of the ranges perfectly. SbF5 is another, but its molecular weight does not match any range well. Given that A4 must be one of the five compounds, and SbF3 is one of them, the most logical choice based on the given numeric ranges is that A4 is SbF3.\n\nFinal check:\n- Y = Sb\n- A1 = unstable higher fluoride (e.g. polymeric)\n- A2 = SbF3 (ωF ~31.9%)\n- A3 = SbF5 (oxidizes Xe)\n- A4 = SbF3 (MW = 178.76 g/mol, fits range 160-180)\n- A5 = product of Sb + SbF3.\nThis set of assignments is consistent with the clues, especially the numerical ones.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote its formula as YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196) = 19n * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 * n) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible molar mass for element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Argon)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Very close to Bromine, M(Br) = 79.9 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No stable element)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury, M(Hg) = 200.6 g/mol)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Plutonium-242 or Americium-243)\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates based on other chemical properties.**\n    The problem states that substance A1 is bright-red and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. It decomposes into A2 and fluorine (A1 -> A2 + F2).\n    *   **Candidate Pu:** A1 would need to be a higher fluoride than A2=PuF6, which is unlikely. While PuF6 is reddish and oxidizes xenon, if A1=PuF6, then A2=PuF4. The mass percentage of F in PuF4 is ~23.8%, which is far from the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Candidate Sb:** A2=SbF3. The mass percentage is a very good fit (31.88%). This would imply A1=SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and does not oxidize elemental xenon. This contradicts the properties of A1.\n    *   **Candidate Br:** A2=BrF2. Let's calculate the mass percentage of F in BrF2 precisely: ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (79.90 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 117.90 ≈ 0.3223 or 32.23%. This is very close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of only 0.8%). While BrF2 is a radical, this numerical fit is strong. Let's proceed with Y=Bromine as a hypothesis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining clues with Y = Bromine.**\n    *   Y = Br.\n    *   A2 = BrF2 (from mass % calculation).\n    *   A1 -> A2 + F2 implies A1 -> BrF2 + F2. For this decomposition to be stoichiometrically balanced, A1 must be BrF4. (BrF4 -> BrF2 + F2). This also identifies A1 as a radical species.\n    *   Properties of A1=BrF4: The problem states it's bright-red, decomposes at 293K, and oxidizes xenon. While bromine fluorides are typically colorless, BrF is reddish. As BrF4 is an unstable radical, these properties are plausible in the context of a complex chemistry problem.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    The crucial clue is the formation of A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is Y + A4 -> A5, where Y=Br.\n    The most straightforward interpretation of this type of reaction is a comproportionation, where an element in its elemental state reacts with one of its compounds to form a compound of an intermediate oxidation state. A general form is Y + YF_x -> 2 YF_(x/2).\n    This implies a relationship between the formulas of A4 and A5. Let's try to identify A4 by working backward from the given answer options. The options are ranges for the molecular weight of A4.\n\n    Let's assume the reaction is of the type Y + YF_x -> 2YF_{x/2}. This means A4 = YF_x.\n    Let's assume option D is correct, meaning M(A4) is in the range [140-160].\n    M(A4) = M(Y) + x * M(F)\n    Since we hypothesized Y=Br (M≈79.9), we can solve for x:\n    79.9 + x * 19 ≈ [140, 160]\n    x * 19 ≈ [60.1, 80.1]\n    x ≈ [3.16, 4.21]\n    The only integer value for x in this range is **x=4**.\n\n    This implies that **A4 = BrF4**. Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(BrF4) = M(Br) + 4 * M(F) = 79.90 + 4 * 19.00 = 79.90 + 76.00 = **155.9 g/mol**.\n\n    This value, 155.9 g/mol, falls perfectly within the range of option D) 140-160.\n\n5.  **Final Check.**\n    The identification Y=Br leads to A2=BrF2 based on the mass percentage. It also leads to A4=BrF4 based on the molecular weight options. This is consistent, as A1 (which decomposes to A2) could be the same substance as A4 (A1=A4=BrF4). The chemistry involves unstable radical species, but the numerical evidence from two different clues (mass percentage and molecular weight range) converges on this single answer. The other candidates (Pu, Sb) lead to irreconcilable contradictions with the given options or chemical properties.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 is 155.9 g/mol, which falls in the range 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Fraction of Fluorine in Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). The atomic mass of fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)):\n    Ar(Y) = n × Ar(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (3.1289 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    Now, we test integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass for a known element:\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Krypton, Kr, with Ar=83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, with Ar=121.76 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidates using Chemical Properties.**\n    We must use the other clues to determine which candidate is correct. The properties of substance A1 are key. A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" into A2 and fluorine, and it \"oxidizes xenon\".\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** If Y=Sb, then A2=SbF₃ (since n=3 fits the mass perfectly). A1, which decomposes into A2 and F₂, would have to be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid at room temperature (293 K). This directly contradicts the description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\". Therefore, Y is not Antimony.\n\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** If Y=Kr, then A2=KrF₂ (for n=2). Although the mass calculation isn't perfect (calculated ɷF is ~31.2%), let's check the chemical properties.\n        *   **A1:** Decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**.\n        *   Let's check the properties of A1 = KrF₄ against the clues:\n            *   \"bright-red substance\": KrF₄ has been reported as a red solid. This is a good fit.\n            *   \"decomposes at 293 K\": KrF₄ is known to be extremely unstable, decomposing at temperatures above -100 °C (173 K). It would certainly decompose at room temperature (293 K). This is a perfect fit.\n            *   \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\": KrF₄ is an exceptionally powerful fluorinating agent, much stronger than fluorine gas, and can easily oxidize xenon. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   Conclusion: The Krypton hypothesis aligns perfectly with the chemical properties described for A1. In such problems, distinctive chemical properties are often more reliable than a single numerical value which may have a typo. We proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Substances.**\n    *   **A3:** It is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Kr), so Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. Thus, **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A5 and A4:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio: Kr + A4 → A5. A5 is a binary fluoride of krypton, most likely the more stable one, **A5 = KrF₂**. The reaction is therefore Kr + A4 → KrF₂. A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This suggests A4 is a powerful liquid fluorinating agent. An interhalogen compound fits this description. A plausible reaction with 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n        Kr + BrF₅ → KrF₂ + BrF₃\n    *   This reaction is chemically sound. Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅) is a colorless liquid and a potent fluorinating agent, strong enough to react with an inert gas. Thus, it is a very strong candidate for **A4 = BrF₅**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Having identified A4 as Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅), we can now calculate its molecular weight.\n\n    ```python\n    # Atomic mass of Bromine (Br) is 79.904 g/mol\n    # Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is 18.9984 g/mol\n    mw_brf5 = 79.904 + 5 * 18.9984\n    print(f\"{mw_brf5:.2f}\")\n    ```\n    174.90\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (BrF₅) is 174.90 g/mol. We compare this value to the given options:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 174.90 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the unknown element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the formula of compound A2 be YFₓ, where Y is the unknown element and x is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19x) = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19x * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    Now, we test integer values for x to find a plausible element Y:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but the chemistry of forming five fluorides and oxidizing xenon does not fit).\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check: 83.8 / 40.45 ≈ 2.07. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony, Sb, M ≈ 121.8 g/mol). Antimony typically forms only two stable fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅, which contradicts the clue about five binary compounds.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Krypton (Y=Kr) hypothesis against the other clues.** This is the most promising candidate.\n    *   **A2**: If Y=Kr and x=2, then A2 is KrF₂ (Krypton difluoride). The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%, which is a reasonable match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride. Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) is known to be unstable and decomposes at or below room temperature (293 K) into KrF₂ and F₂. The reaction is `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. This fits perfectly. A1 is also a very strong oxidizer and would oxidize xenon, which is characteristic of higher noble gas fluorides.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is formed by fluorinating Y. `Kr + F₂ → KrF₂`. So, A3 = KrF₂. KrF₂ is a known strong oxidizer that reacts with xenon. This fits.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is formed by reacting Y (Kr) with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. If A4 is KrF₄, the reaction is `Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂`. This is a known comproportionation reaction with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. Thus, A5 would be KrF₂. The solution of A4 (KrF₄) is described as colorless, which is correct. This set of clues strongly suggests A4 is KrF₄.\n    *   **A5 decomposition in water**: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water: `KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF`. The problem states it forms \"two substances,\" which is a minor discrepancy but acceptable in the context of a puzzle (perhaps referring to the two elemental products, Kr and O₂).\n\n    The Krypton hypothesis provides a consistent explanation for almost all the clues, especially the chemical reactions and stoichiometry.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄). We can now calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.80 + 4 * 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.80 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this to the given options:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol. The code output of 159.7916 confirms this calculation with higher precision.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y and Substance A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of an element Y can be calculated using the formula:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n\nUsing the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) as ~19 g/mol and the given mass fraction (0.3196):\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19 / 0.3196) - (n × 19) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n':\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (resembles Calcium or Argon, which are chemically unlikely candidates based on the other information).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr), which is 83.8 g/mol. Let's verify the mass percentage for KrF₂. Using precise atomic masses (Kr ≈ 83.8 g/mol, F ≈ 19 g/mol), the mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 2 * 19) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n\nLet's assume Y is Krypton (Kr) and A2 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).\n\n**2. Identifying Substances A1, A3, A4, and A5**\n\n*   **A1:** It is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This implies the reaction: A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. Therefore, A1 must be Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄). KrF₄ is known to be thermally unstable. One inconsistency is its color; KrF₄ is reported as a white crystalline solid, not bright-red. However, given the other fitting evidence, this might be an inaccuracy in the problem description. Importantly, A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent and would oxidize xenon, which fits the description.\n*   **A3:** This substance is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Krypton) and also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of Krypton produces KrF₂. So, A3 is KrF₂.\n*   **A4 and A5:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. Considering the known binary fluorides of Krypton (KrF₂ and KrF₄), this reaction is most plausibly the comproportionation of Krypton metal with Krypton tetrafluoride:\n    Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂\n    This reaction fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and **A5 as KrF₂**. The \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could refer to KrF₄ dissolved in a solvent like anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF).\n\n**3. Verifying the Final Clues**\n\n*   **Five binary compounds:** The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. For Krypton, only KrF₂ is well-characterized, and KrF₄ is highly unstable and its initial discovery was later disputed. However, theoretical calculations suggest other fluorides like KrF₆ could exist under specific conditions, and various ions like KrF⁺ and Kr₂F₃⁺ are known. This clue might be interpreted loosely to include these species.\n*   **Decomposition of A5 in water:** The problem states that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water to form two substances. The hydrolysis of KrF₂ is complex, but one possible interpretation is the simple decomposition into its constituent elements, which can be facilitated by water:\n    KrF₂ → Kr + F₂\n    This yields two distinct substances, Krypton gas and Fluorine gas, fitting the description.\n\n**4. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the deductions, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\nThe molecular weight is calculated as:\nM(A4) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nM(A4) ≈ 83.8 g/mol + 4 × 19.0 g/mol = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n**5. Selecting the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying an element Y and its five binary fluorides, labeled A1 through A5, based on their described chemical properties.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of the substances:\n*   **Element Y and its five binary fluorides**: The existence of five binary fluorides points towards elements with multiple oxidation states, such as actinides (like Plutonium or Uranium) or certain noble gases under specific conditions.\n*   **Substance A1**: It's a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) and oxidizes xenon. The ability to oxidize xenon points to a very powerful oxidizing agent, typical of high-valent fluorides like hexafluorides or tetrafluorides of certain elements. The decomposition at room temperature indicates it is thermally unstable.\n*   **Substance A2**: A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). This means A1 must have a higher fluorine-to-Y ratio than A2. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n*   **Substance A3**: This compound is formed by the fluorination of element Y and can also interact with xenon, suggesting it is also a strong oxidizing fluoride.\n*   **Substances A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding element Y to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a high oxidation state (A4) to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n*   **Decomposition of A5**: In water, A5 decomposes to form two other substances.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates for element Y.\n\nInitially, actinides like Plutonium (Pu) seem plausible as they form multiple fluorides. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid and a powerful oxidizing agent. It decomposes into PuF₄ and fluorine. However, if A1 is PuF₆ and A2 is PuF₄, the fluorine mass percentage of A2 (PuF₄) is about 23.75%, which does not match the given 31.96%. If we assume A2 is PuF₆ (which has ɷF ≈ 31.84%, very close to the given value), it contradicts the decomposition reaction where A1 must be a higher fluoride than A2. Furthermore, if A4 were PuF₆, its molecular weight would be approximately 358 g/mol, which does not fit any of the provided answer ranges.\n\nLet's consider another candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**. Although the existence of five stable binary fluorides of Krypton is not established (only KrF₂ and the unstable KrF₄ are known), this hypothesis resolves the other clues successfully.\n1.  **A1 and A2**: Let's test the decomposition `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. Krypton tetrafluoride (A1) is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K), decomposing into krypton difluoride (A2) and fluorine. This fits the description. While KrF₄ is often described as a white solid, some high-valence fluorides can be colored.\n2.  **Mass Percentage of A2**: The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (KrF₂) is approximately 31.2%. This value (31.2%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n3.  **Oxidizing Power**: A1 (KrF₄) and A3 (which could also be KrF₂ or KrF₄) are extremely powerful fluorinating agents and would oxidize xenon.\n4.  **A4 and A5**: The reaction of adding element Y (Kr) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to get A5 can be interpreted as the comproportionation `Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂`. In this reaction, A4 is KrF₄ and A5 is KrF₂. The reactants are indeed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n5.  **Decomposition of A5**: The decomposition of A5 (KrF₂) in water is complex but does yield multiple products. The problem states two substances are formed, which could be a simplification.\n\nThe crucial step is to determine the molecular weight of A4. Based on our hypothesis, **A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n\nThe molecular weight of KrF₄ is calculated as:\nMW(KrF₄) = MW(Kr) + 4 * MW(F)\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct molecular weight range for substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**:\n    The substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume the general formula of A2 is YFₙ. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol) and the integer n by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    Rearranging for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n\n2.  **Test Plausible Candidates for Y**:\n    By testing integer values for 'n', we can find potential candidates for element Y.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 3 * 40.45 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is a very close match.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 6 * 40.45 = 242.7 g/mol. This is close to the molar mass of **Plutonium (Pu)**, which is approximately 244 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine in PuF₆ is about 31.84%, also a very close match.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) is also reasonably close to **Iodine (I)** (M=126.9 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for IF₃ is about 31.0%.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates based on Other Clues**:\n    *   **Antimony (Sb)**: If Y is Sb, then A2 would be SbF₃. The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This would imply A1 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid, which contradicts the description.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu)**: If Y is Pu, then A2 is PuF₆. The reaction where A5 is formed (Pu + A4 -> A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio) works perfectly if A4=PuF₆ and A5=PuF₃ (as Pu + PuF₆ → 2PuF₃). However, the molecular weight of A4 (PuF₆) is approximately 358 g/mol, which is far outside any of the given answer ranges.\n    *   **Iodine (I)**: This candidate presents the most consistent pathway, despite some discrepancies in the provided data.\n        *   **Y = Iodine (I)**. The known binary fluorides are IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇. The problem states five are known.\n        *   **A2 = IF₃**. We accept the slight inaccuracy in the fluorine mass percentage (31.0% calculated vs. 31.96% given).\n        *   **A1** is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes to A2(IF₃) and fluorine. This would mean A1 is IF₅ or IF₇. Both are colorless, which is a major inconsistency in the problem statement. However, we proceed by prioritizing the chemical reaction logic.\n        *   **A3** is formed by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon. Direct fluorination of iodine can produce IF₅ or IF₇. IF₇ is known to react with xenon, making it a plausible candidate for A3.\n        *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is formed by adding Y (Iodine) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction where the oxidation state of iodine is averaged. Let's test the reaction with A4 = IF₅:\n          I + IF₅ → 2IF₃\n          This reaction is balanced and shows a 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants, Iodine (Y) and iodine pentafluoride (A4). The product would be A5 = IF₃.\n        *   **Decomposition of A5**: The problem states that A5 (IF₃) decomposes in water to form two substances. Iodine trifluoride is unstable and known to react with water, for instance through hydrolysis to form an iodine oxyfluoride and hydrofluoric acid (e.g., IF₃ + H₂O → IFO + 2HF). This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    Based on the analysis, the most logical identification for A4 is iodine pentafluoride (IF₅).\n    *   Molar Mass of Iodine (I) ≈ 126.9 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of IF₅ = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**:\n    The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nDespite the inconsistencies in the problem statement regarding the color of A1 and the precise mass fraction in A2, the chemical reactions and the resulting molecular weight for the iodine-based compounds provide a coherent solution that matches one of the options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information about substance A2.**\n    We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YF_m. The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is 31.96% (or 0.3196).\n    The formula for mass fraction is:\n    ωF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n    where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19 g/mol), and 'm' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = m * M(F) * (1/ωF - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * (3.1289 - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * 2.1289\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m\n\n2.  **Use the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m to find possible identities for Y.**\n    We can test integer values for 'm' (the oxidation state of Y in A2) and see if the resulting M(Y) corresponds to a known element.\n    *   If m = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. (Closest element is Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If m = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. (Close to Br, Se, Kr).\n    *   If m = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol. (Close to Sb).\n    *   If m = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. (Very close to Dysprosium, Dy, M=162.5 g/mol).\n    *   If m = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. (Close to Bi, Pb).\n    *   If m = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. (Close to Pu, Am).\n\n3.  **Analyze the information about substances A4 and A5.**\n    We are told: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5. Since Y is in its elemental form (oxidation state 0) and A4 and A5 are both fluorides of Y, this is a comproportionation reaction. Let A4 = YF_n. The most straightforward interpretation of a 1:1 molar ratio leading to a single product A5 is:\n    Y(0) + Y(n+)F_n → 2 Y(n/2+)F_{n/2}\n    This means that A5 = YF_{n/2}, and importantly, the number of fluorine atoms 'n' in A4 must be an even number. A4 is also described as forming a colorless solution.\n\n4.  **Test the candidate Y = Dysprosium (Dy).**\n    From step 2, the case m=4 gave an excellent match for Dysprosium (Dy).\n    Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   Y = Dy (M = 162.5 g/mol).\n    *   m = 162.5 / 40.45 = 4.017, which is extremely close to 4.\n    *   This suggests A2 is DyF4. Let's verify the mass fraction for DyF4:\n        M(DyF4) = 162.5 + 4 * 19 = 238.5 g/mol.\n        ωF(DyF4) = (4 * 19) / 238.5 = 76 / 238.5 = 0.3186 (or 31.86%).\n        This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that A2 = DyF4 is a very strong possibility.\n    *   Now let's find A4. According to the reaction logic in step 3, A4 must be YF_n where 'n' is an even number. Let's propose A4 = DyF4 (where n=4, which is even).\n    *   The reaction would be: Dy + DyF4 → 2 DyF2. A5 would be DyF2. This is a plausible chemical reaction.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We identified A4 as DyF4.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 = DyF4 is 238.5 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 238.5 g/mol. Let's check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 238.5 falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Although some qualitative descriptions in the problem (like the red color of A1, the oxidation of xenon, and the existence of five fluorides) conflict with the known chemistry of Dysprosium, the quantitative data points strongly and consistently to Dysprosium. The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 perfectly matches DyF4, and identifying A4 as DyF4 leads to a molecular weight that fits exactly into one of the provided answer ranges. Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the numerical data is that A4 is DyF4.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (DyF4) is 238.5 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis is a complex problem that requires careful analysis of several conflicting pieces of information. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2 is given as 31.96%. Let A2 have the formula YFₙ, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19)\n\n    Solving for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for *n*:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (No suitable element)\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but other properties do not match)\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No suitable element)\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Near Bismuth or Gold, but the mass fit is not as good)\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Plutonium).\n\n    The most precise numerical fit is for Y = Sb and n = 3. Therefore, **A2 is SbF₃**. The molar mass of SbF₃ is approximately 178.76 g/mol, and its fluorine percentage is 31.88%, very close to the given 31.96%.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Other Clues (and identify inconsistencies).**\n    The problem provides several chemical properties that are characteristic of very powerful fluorinating agents, such as being a \"bright-red substance\" (A1), decomposing easily (A1), and oxidizing xenon (A1 and A3). These properties do not match the chemistry of antimony fluorides (SbF₃ and SbF₅), which are white/colorless solids and are not powerful enough to oxidize xenon under normal conditions. This indicates that the problem contains deliberate red herrings, a common feature in chemistry olympiad questions, and one must rely on the most quantitative data—the mass percentage.\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine, so A1 must be a higher fluoride. The other main fluoride of antimony is **SbF₅**. So, A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and interacts with xenon. This is also **SbF₅**, which is a strong Lewis acid and can form adducts with xenon fluorides.\n    *   **A4 & A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of itself in a higher oxidation state to form a product in an intermediate state.\n        Sb(0) + A4[Sb(V)] → A5[Sb(III)]\n    This means **A4 = SbF₅** and **A5 = SbF₃**. The actual balanced reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`, so the 1:1 molar ratio given in the problem is another inconsistency that must be overlooked to solve the puzzle.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 (SbF₃) decomposes in water to form two substances. Antimony trifluoride hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which fits the description.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the substance A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). We calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F)\n    M(A4) ≈ 121.76 g/mol + 5 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) ≈ 121.76 + 95.00\n    M(A4) ≈ 216.76 g/mol\n\n5.  **Match the Result with the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is ~217 g/mol. Let's examine the options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value of 216.76 g/mol does not fall perfectly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range B (220-240). Such minor discrepancies in the ranges are not uncommon in complex problems of this nature. Given the logical deduction that A4 is SbF₅, this is the most plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nMy step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using Mass Percentage:** The problem states that a compound, A2, is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a fluorine weight percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)) in a compound YF_n can be derived from the weight percentage formula:\n    `Ar(Y) = (n * Ar(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF`.\n    Using Ar(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we get:\n    `Ar(Y) ≈ n * 40.35`.\n    Testing small integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    -   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.35 g/mol (close to Calcium, but chemistry doesn't fit).\n    -   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.7 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its fluorides' mass percentages don't match).\n    -   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.05 g/mol. This value is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol) and reasonably close to Iodine (I, 126.9 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Y Candidates (Iodine vs. Antimony):** The clue \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known\" is crucial. Iodine is known to form several stable binary fluorides (IF, IF3, IF5, IF7) and related species (like the dimer I2F6), fitting the description of \"five compounds\". Antimony, on the other hand, primarily forms only two stable binary fluorides (SbF3 and SbF5). Therefore, **Iodine (I)** is the most likely candidate for element Y. The slight discrepancy in the mass percentage calculation is likely due to an inaccuracy in the problem's provided value.\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    -   If Y is Iodine and `n=3`, then **A2 is IF3** (Iodine trifluoride).\n    -   Substance A1 decomposes to A2 (IF3) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride. By mass balance, `A1 -> IF3 + F2` implies **A1 is IF5** (Iodine pentafluoride). *Note: Some properties listed for A1, like its color and decomposition temperature, are inconsistent with pure IF5, which is a common feature in complex chemistry problems to test core chemical principles over trivia.*\n    -   The reaction described is `Y + A4 -> A5`, which is a comproportionation (the element in oxidation state 0 reacts with the same element in a higher oxidation state to form an intermediate state). This requires A4 to be a higher fluoride than A5.\n\n4.  **Determine A4 using Molecular Weight Ranges:** The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of iodine's fluorides and compare them to the given options.\n    -   MW(IF) = 126.9 + 19.0 = 145.9 g/mol -> Range A\n    -   MW(IF3) = 126.9 + 3*19.0 = 183.9 g/mol -> No range matches\n    -   MW(IF5) = 126.9 + 5*19.0 = 221.9 g/mol -> Range D\n    -   MW(IF7) = 126.9 + 7*19.0 = 259.9 g/mol -> No range matches\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:** Based on the options, A4 is either IF or IF5. The reaction is `I + A4 -> A5`. For a comproportionation to occur, we add the element to a higher-valent compound. Therefore, A4 must be the higher fluoride, **IF5**. The product, A5, would be a lower fluoride like IF3. The molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is 221.9 g/mol, which falls perfectly within range D.\n\n```python\n# Atomic weight of Iodine (I)\nAr_I = 126.9\n# Atomic weight of Fluorine (F)\nAr_F = 19.0\n\n# Based on the reasoning, element Y is Iodine and substance A4 is Iodine Pentafluoride (IF5).\n# Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4 (IF5).\nnum_fluorine_atoms = 5\nmolecular_weight_A4 = Ar_I + num_fluorine_atoms * Ar_F\n\nprint(f\"The element Y is identified as Iodine (I).\")\nprint(f\"Substance A4 is identified as Iodine Pentafluoride (IF5).\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is {molecular_weight_A4:.1f} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given ranges:\")\nprint(\"A) 140-160\")\nprint(\"B) 160-180\")\nprint(\"C) 110-130\")\nprint(\"D) 220-240\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated molecular weight of {molecular_weight_A4:.1f} g/mol falls into range D.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: D\")\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The element Y is identified as Iodine (I).\nSubstance A4 is identified as Iodine Pentafluoride (IF5).\nThe molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is 221.9 g/mol.\n\nComparing this to the given ranges:\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls into range D.\n\nFinal Answer Choice: D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe first crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approx. 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca, or Scandium, Sc).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br, or Selenium, Se).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Lead, Pb, or Bismuth, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the fluorine percentage for A2 being SbF3:\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis is very close to the given 31.96% (a difference of only 0.25%), making it the most likely candidate.\nThus, **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound A3**\n\nThe problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine (Sb + F2 -> A3) and that A3 can interact with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is formed by direct fluorination of antimony and is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (typically by forming adducts with xenon fluorides, e.g., XeF2·SbF5).\nTherefore, **A3 is SbF5**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction to find A4 and A5**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in this clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This can be written as:\nSb + A4 --(1:1 molar ratio)--> A5\n\nThis is a comproportionation reaction, where antimony in oxidation state 0 (elemental Sb) reacts with antimony in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form antimony in an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n\nThe next clue is: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\nLet's check the hydrolysis of antimony fluorides:\n*   SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF (two products: antimony(III) oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride).\n*   SbF5 + 2H2O → SbO2F + 4HF (two products: antimony(V) oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride).\nBoth SbF3 and SbF5 fit this description. However, since A5 is the product of a comproportionation starting with Sb(0) and a higher oxidation state, A5 must have a lower oxidation state than A4. The most stable lower oxidation state fluoride is SbF3. Let's assume **A5 = SbF3**.\n\nNow, let's substitute A5=SbF3 back into the reaction equation:\nSb + A4 --(1:1 molar ratio)--> SbF3\n\nLet A4 be SbF_x. The balanced chemical equation for the comproportionation would be:\n`a Sb + b SbFx → c SbF3`\nTo satisfy the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants, we must have a = b. Let's set a=1 and b=1.\n`1 Sb(0) + 1 Sb(+x)Fx → c Sb(+3)F3`\nConservation of Sb atoms: 1 + 1 = c => c = 2.\nThe reaction is `Sb + SbFx → 2 SbF3`.\nConservation of F atoms: x = 2 * 3 => x = 6.\n\nSo, the reaction is: **Sb + SbF6 → 2 SbF3**.\nThis reaction is perfectly balanced with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This means that **A4 must be SbF6**. Although SbF6 is not a common stable compound (unlike the [SbF6]⁻ anion), its existence is implied by the logic of the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Find the Correct Range**\n\nNow we calculate the molecular weight (M) of A4, which we identified as SbF6.\nM(SbF6) = M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\nM(SbF6) = 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 114 = 235.76 g/mol.\n\nFinally, we check which of the given ranges contains this value:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight, 235.76 g/mol, falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n**Final Check:** The remaining clues about A1 (\"bright-red\", decomposes to SbF3 and F2, oxidizes Xe) are complex and point to a highly unstable/exotic species. However, identifying A1 is not necessary to determine A4. The logic derived from A2, A3, A4, and A5 is self-consistent and leads to a unique answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nBased on the reasoning and the output from the code execution, the conclusion is as follows:\n\n1.  The mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2 (31.96%) was used to identify element Y as Antimony (Sb) and compound A2 as Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃).\n2.  The question asks for the molecular weight range of compound A4, which must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony.\n3.  The molecular weights of the two most common antimony fluorides were calculated:\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF₃ = 178.76 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF₅ = 216.76 g/mol\n4.  Comparing these values to the given options:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 160-180\n5.  Only the molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits into one of the provided ranges (Option D). The molecular weight of SbF₅ does not fit into any of the ranges.\n6.  Therefore, substance A4 must be SbF₃.\n\nThe correct range for the molecular weight of A4 is 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2\n\nThe first crucial piece of information is that substance A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)) * 100%\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n*   M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y\n*   n is an integer representing the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nWe are given ɷF = 31.96%, so we can write:\n0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n\nRearranging for M(Y):\nM(Y) * 0.3196 + 19.00 * n * 0.3196 = 19.00 * n\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196)\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = 19.00 * n * 0.6804\nM(Y) = (19.00 * 0.6804 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible atomic mass for an element Y known to form multiple fluorides:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but Ca chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but the mass percentages for bromine fluorides do not match).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Terbium/Dysprosium, but their chemistry is less likely to fit the subsequent clues).\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for Antimony trifluoride (SbF3):\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100% ≈ 31.88%\n\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96%. Therefore, we can confidently identify:\n*   Element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   Substance A2 is **Antimony trifluoride (SbF3)**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Other Compounds and Reactions\n\n*   **A3:** It's obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it interacts with Xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields SbF3 or SbF5, and SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid known to react with xenon compounds. Thus, **A3 is SbF5**.\n*   **A1:** It decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, likely SbF5. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) does not perfectly match pure SbF5 (a colorless liquid), suggesting it might be an unstable polymorph or impure form, but its chemical role as a higher fluoride is clear.\n*   **A5:** It decomposes in water to form two substances. This is characteristic of a mixed-valence compound, which upon hydrolysis would yield compounds of antimony in two different oxidation states (e.g., Sb(III) and Sb(V)).\n*   **A4:** The reaction is \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This is a comproportionation reaction where Sb(0) reduces a higher oxidation state antimony compound (A4) to form the mixed-valence compound A5. This implies A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state, such as Sb(V). Therefore, A4 should be SbF5 or a mixed-valence fluoride.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nHere we face a contradiction between chemical principles and the provided options:\n1.  **Chemical approach:** A4 must be an oxidizing agent for Sb(0), so it cannot be SbF3. A4 is likely SbF5. The molecular weight of SbF5 is 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**. This value does not fit well into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A (220-240) but lies outside of it.\n2.  **Numerical approach:** Let's examine the molecular weights of the possible antimony fluorides in relation to the options.\n    *   M(SbF3) = **178.76 g/mol**. This value falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   M(SbF5) = **216.76 g/mol**. This does not fall within any range.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that the molecular weight of one of the key compounds matches one of the options exactly. The molecular weight of SbF3 (which we identified as A2) is a perfect fit for range C.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that A4 is the same substance as A2, namely SbF3. This creates a chemical puzzle with the reaction `Sb + SbF3 -> A5`, which is not a standard reaction. However, in the context of such problems, a numerical match this precise is a very strong indicator. It is more likely that the description of the reaction is either flawed or refers to an obscure chemical process than that the numerical data (mass percentage) and the options are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that A4 is SbF3 based on its molecular weight.\n\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   This value is in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range **160-180**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  **Identification of Element Y and A2**: Based on the information that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%, we can determine the identity of element Y. By calculating the expected atomic mass of Y for a formula YF_n, the best fit is achieved when n=3, yielding a mass very close to that of Antimony (Sb). Therefore, element Y is Antimony, and A2 is Antimony trifluoride, SbF3.\n2.  **Molecular Weight of A2 (SbF3)**: The molecular weight of SbF3 is calculated as the sum of the atomic masses of Antimony (≈121.76 g/mol) and three Fluorine atoms (3 * 19.00 g/mol), which equals approximately **178.76 g/mol**.\n3.  **Determining A4**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We are given several clues about the compounds. A3 is formed by fluorinating antimony and reacts with xenon, which strongly points to A3 being antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). The reaction to form A5 (`Y + A4 -> A5`) involves reducing an antimony fluoride (A4) with elemental antimony (Y), implying A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state (like SbF5). However, the molecular weight of SbF5 (≈216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n4.  **Conclusion on A4's Molecular Weight**: We observe that the calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**. In puzzle-like chemistry problems, such a direct numerical correspondence is a very strong clue. It is most probable that A4 is the same compound as A2 (SbF3), despite the apparent chemical contradiction in the reaction description, which may be flawed or refer to an obscure process. Based on the compelling numerical evidence, A4 is identified as SbF3.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which falls into the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The key information is that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for a binary fluoride is YF_n.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F), where M_Y is the molar mass of element Y and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    Rearranging for M_Y: M_Y = (n * M_F / ɷF) - (n * M_F) = n * M_F * (1/ɷF - 1).\n    Plugging in the values: M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1/0.3196 - 1) = n * 19.00 * (3.129 - 1) = n * 40.45.\n    We can now test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, which doesn't fit the other clues).\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the actual mass percentage for KrF₂: ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol). The mass percentage for SbF₃ is ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 57.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is an even better match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates Y=Kr and Y=Sb using other clues:**\n    *   **Clue:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"\n    *   If Y = Sb, A2 would be SbF₃. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride, i.e., SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless, stable liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. Also, while SbF₅ is a strong Lewis acid, its ability to oxidize Xenon under normal conditions is not its most defining characteristic in the way it is for other compounds. This path seems unlikely.\n    *   If Y = Kr, A2 would be KrF₂. A1 would be a higher fluoride, KrF₄.\n        *   **Decomposition:** KrF₄ is known to be extremely unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature (293 K) into KrF₂ and F₂. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   **Oxidizing Power:** Krypton compounds are exceptionally powerful oxidizing agents. KrF₂ itself can oxidize xenon. The KrF⁺ cation, which could be formed from KrF₂, is one of the strongest known oxidizers and readily oxidizes xenon. A higher fluoride like KrF₄ would therefore certainly oxidize xenon. This fits.\n        *   **Color:** The only inconsistency is the color. KrF₄ is described as a white solid, not \"bright-red\". Given that all other chemical properties strongly point to Krypton, the color description in the problem is likely an error.\n\n3.  **Confirm Identity of A3:**\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"\n    *   Fluorination of Krypton produces Krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is known to react with (oxidize) xenon. So, A3 = KrF₂. This is consistent with our assignment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Compounds and Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   So far, we have identified Y = Krypton, A1 = KrF₄, and A2 = A3 = KrF₂.\n    *   Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n        *   M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   M(KrF₄) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. The remaining clues describe a reaction involving A4 to produce A5. This reaction (\"adding Y...to...solution of A4\") seems chemically implausible as written and may be a red herring.\n    *   However, the question presents four molecular weight ranges, two of which correspond perfectly to the compounds we have identified:\n        *   **A) 110-130:** Contains M(KrF₂) = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   **D) 140-160:** Contains M(KrF₄) = 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   The problem introduces A1 and A4 as distinct entities in the narrative. A1 is defined by its decomposition. A4 is defined as a reactant in a solution. Since A1 has been identified as KrF₄, it is logical to assume that A4 is the other major fluoride of krypton, which is KrF₂.\n\nTherefore, A4 is KrF₂, and its molecular weight is ~121.8 g/mol, which falls into the range 110-130.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage of A2.**\n    Let the formula of substance A2 be YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    We are given ɷF = 31.96% (or 0.3196) and the molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M(Y), the molar mass of element Y, we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n    We can test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca or Sc, which do not form five fluorides).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, but its fluorides don't match other clues).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Iodine (I)**, which is 126.9 g/mol. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Au, M=197.0 g/mol). This is another possibility.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (similar to Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Iodine (Y=I) Hypothesis.**\n    If Y is Iodine and n=3, then substance **A2 is IF₃** (Iodine trifluoride). Iodine is known to form several binary fluorides, including IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇. The existence of five compounds as stated in the problem is plausible if dimers or unstable species are included.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A1.**\n    The problem states that the bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine gas (F₂). This decomposition (A1 → IF₃ + F₂) implies A1 is a higher fluoride of iodine.\n    Let's test A1 = IF₅. The reaction would be IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂. This is a chemically sound decomposition.\n    The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is inconsistent with pure IF₅, which is a colorless liquid. This is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as the other chemical clues for the Iodine path are consistent. A1 being a strong oxidizer that reacts with xenon is also true for iodine fluorides.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    The crucial clue is: \"By adding Y (Iodine) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   **A4**: The solution of A4 is colorless. Of the known iodine fluorides, IF₅ and IF₇ are colorless, while IF₃ is yellow and IF is unstable. Therefore, A4 is likely IF₅ or IF₇.\n    *   **The Reaction**: Y + A4 → A5 is a comproportionation reaction, where iodine in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with an iodine fluoride of a higher oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = IF₅**. The reaction with iodine (Y) is:\n        I + IF₅ → 2IF₃\n    This reaction is balanced and proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio of I atoms to IF₅ molecules. The product formed is IF₃.\n    *   **A5**: The product of the reaction is **A5 = IF₃**.\n    *   **Final Check**: The problem states A5 decomposes in water. IF₃ reacts vigorously with water to form hydrofluoric acid and iodic acid, fitting the description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅).\n    Molecular Weight (MW) of IF₅ = M(I) + 5 × M(F)\n    MW(IF₅) = 126.9 g/mol + 5 × 19.0 g/mol\n    MW(IF₅) = 126.9 + 95.0\n    MW(IF₅) = 221.9 g/mol\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identifying Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    *   We are given that compound A2 is a fluoride of element Y (YFₓ) and contains 31.96% fluorine by mass.\n    *   Using the formula for mass percentage, `Molar Mass of Y ≈ 40.45 * x`, where x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   Testing integer values for x, we find that for x=6, the molar mass of Y is approximately 242.7 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). Actinides like americium are known to form multiple fluorides.\n    *   Let's verify: The molecular weight of AmF₆ is 243 + 6*(19) = 357 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (6*19)/357 ≈ 31.93%, which confirms our identification.\n    *   So, **Element Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is Americium hexafluoride (AmF₆)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Compounds A1 and A3:**\n    *   **A1** decomposes into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher, less stable fluoride, such as AmF₇. As a higher fluoride, it would be a very powerful oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing xenon, which matches the description.\n    *   **A3** is formed by fluorinating americium and also oxidizes xenon. This is consistent with A3 also being a high-oxidation-state fluoride, most likely **AmF₆**.\n\n3.  **Identifying Compounds A4 and A5:**\n    *   **A5** is obtained by reacting element Y (Am) with a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Solutions of americium compounds are typically colored. Therefore, A4 is likely the reagent dissolved in a colorless solvent (like anhydrous HF), not an americium compound itself.\n    *   A \"colorless\" powerful fluorinating agent that reacts 1:1 with a metal suggests a noble gas fluoride. **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) fits this description perfectly.** It is a colorless solid that forms a powerful fluorinating solution.\n    *   The reaction is: Am + KrF₂ → AmF₂ + Kr. This reaction proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Therefore, **A4 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) and A5 is Americium(II) fluoride (AmF₂)**.\n    *   The description that A5 (AmF₂) decomposes in water into two substances is also consistent, as the Am²⁺ ion is unstable in aqueous solution and would disproportionate into Am³⁺ and Am⁰.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   We have identified A4 as Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).\n    *   Molecular Weight of Kr = ~83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of F = ~19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₂ = 83.80 + 2 * (19.00) = 121.80 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of substance A4 is 121.80 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 110-130.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196, and the atomic mass of fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the atomic mass of element Y (Ar(Y)):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n × 19.00)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 0.3196 × (19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 19.00n × (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 19.00n × 0.6804\nAr(Y) = n × (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nAr(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe can now test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for Y.\n*   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, Ar = 40.08 g/mol)\n*   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, Ar = 79.90 g/mol)\n*   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to Antimony, Ar = 121.76 g/mol)\n*   n=4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (This is close to Dysprosium, Ar = 162.50 g/mol)\n\nThe code output from the initial reasoning confirms that Antimony (Sb) is an excellent candidate for Y, with n=3.\nFor Y=Sb and n=3, the compound is SbF3.\nLet's verify the fluorine percentage in SbF3:\nMW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n%F = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 × 100% = 57 / 178.76 × 100% ≈ 31.88%\nThis value (31.88%) is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is likely Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Use the other clues to identify the compounds.**\n*   **Y = Sb**\n*   **A2 = SbF3**\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb). Direct fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride, SbF5. So, **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A3 (SbF5)** can interact with xenon. SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and is known to form adducts with xenon fluorides, so this is consistent.\n*   **A5** decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF3 hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). `SbF3(s) + H2O(l) → SbOF(s) + 2HF(aq)`. This fits the description. Thus, it is highly likely that **A5 = SbF3**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the identity and molecular weight of A4.**\nWe have deduced that A2 and A5 are both SbF3. The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. The clues may be convoluted, but let's consider the most straightforward possibility. In chemistry problems of this type, a substance may appear multiple times under different labels (A2, A4, A5). Let's test the hypothesis that A4 is also SbF3.\n\nIf A4 = SbF3, we can calculate its molecular weight:\nMolecular Weight (MW) of SbF3 = Ar(Sb) + 3 × Ar(F)\nMW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nNow, let's check which of the given ranges this value falls into:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol fits perfectly into the range **160-180**.\n\nWhile some descriptive clues in the problem (like the properties of A1 and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) seem contradictory with standard antimony chemistry, the quantitative data provides a clear path. The mass percentage strongly points to SbF3, and the molecular weight of SbF3 aligns perfectly with one of the answer choices. This is the most logical and consistent solution.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the properties of Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The general formula for this compound is YFₓ.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of an element in a compound is:\n    ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    We are given ωF = 0.3196. So, we can write:\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00 * x) = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We now test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y, to find a corresponding element with a plausible atomic mass:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Argon (Ar, 39.95). Neither is likely to form the compounds described.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90). While Br forms fluorides, the properties do not perfectly align with the rest of the problem.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This value is exceptionally close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is a well-known element that forms multiple fluorides.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.50). This is a rare-earth element and less likely to be the subject of such a problem.\n\n    Let's confirm with Y = Sb and x = 3. The substance A2 would be SbF₃.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is formed by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it can react with xenon. The direct reaction of antimony with excess fluorine gas produces antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅.\n    Sb + (5/2)F₂ → SbF₅\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is famous for reacting with xenon compounds (like XeF₂) to form salts. This confirms that **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    This is the central part of the question. The clues for A4 are:\n    *   It's a component of a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\"\n    *   It reacts with elemental antimony (Y = Sb). This is a redox reaction where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must contain an oxidizing agent.\n    *   This implies A4 must contain antimony in its higher oxidation state, Sb(V).\n\n    Let's examine the options for the molecular weight of A4, assuming it is a compound containing Sb(V):\n    *   The simplest Sb(V) fluoride is SbF₅. Its molecular weight is 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges.\n    *   The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" containing an Sb(V) species strongly suggests the presence of a superacid. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) reacts with hydrogen fluoride (HF) to form **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**, one of the strongest known acids. It exists as a colorless liquid, fitting the description.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of HSbF₆:\n        M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\n        M(HSbF₆) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol.\n\n    This calculated molecular weight of **236.77 g/mol** falls perfectly within the range **D) 220-240**. The presence of Sb(V) in HSbF₆ makes it a powerful oxidant capable of reacting with elemental antimony. Thus, all clues point to A4 being HSbF₆.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFx, where x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of A2 is M(Y) + x * M(F).\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)  (Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe need to find an integer `x` and a corresponding element Y that has a molar mass close to the calculated M(Y). We can test integer values for x:\n*   x=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca or Sc)\n*   x=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br or Se)\n*   x=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb)\n*   x=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy)\n*   x=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg or Bi)\n*   x=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu or Am)\n\nTo determine the correct element, we use the other clues.\n\"A1 is a bright-red substance... decomposes at 293 K... oxidizes xenon.\"\nThis points to a very reactive, high-oxidation-state fluoride of a heavy element. The actinides, like plutonium (Pu), are known for such compounds. Let's test Y = Pu (M ≈ 244 g/mol).\nIf M(Y) = 244, then 244 ≈ 40.45 * x, which gives x ≈ 6.03. This is very close to x=6.\nSo, let's hypothesize that **A2 is PuF6**.\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for PuF6: M(Pu) = 244 g/mol, M(F) = 19 g/mol.\nɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 = 0.3184 or 31.84%.\nThis is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.4%. This is a very strong match.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compounds A1, A3, A4, and A5 using Plutonium Chemistry**\n\n*   **Compound A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine.\"\n    The reaction is A1 -> PuF6 + F2.\n    For this to be balanced, A1 must be a higher fluoride of plutonium, such as PuF8. However, PuF8 is unknown and extremely unlikely to exist. This indicates a contradiction. Let's re-read carefully. Perhaps the roles of A1 and A2 are reversed from our initial assumption based on the properties.\n\n*   Let's re-evaluate based on chemical properties.\n    *   **PuF6** is described as a volatile, reddish-brown solid. This fits \"bright-red substance\".\n    *   **PuF6** is unstable at room temperature (293 K) and decomposes.\n    *   The decomposition of PuF6 is: **PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2**.\n    *   **PuF6** is a very powerful fluorinating agent and can oxidize xenon.\n\n    This means **A1 must be PuF6**.\n    The decomposition reaction is A1 -> A2 + F2, which translates to **PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2**.\n    Therefore, **A2 must be PuF4**.\n\n    Now, we must address the mass percentage discrepancy. The problem states ɷF for A2 is 31.96%. We calculated that for **PuF6**, not PuF4.\n    ɷF(PuF4) = (4 * 19) / (244 + 4*19) = 76 / 320 = 23.75%.\n    This is a significant contradiction. It appears there is an error in the problem statement itself, where the mass percentage given (31.96%) actually corresponds to substance A1 (PuF6), not A2 (PuF4). Given that all other chemical descriptions for Pu chemistry fit perfectly, we proceed by assuming this error in the problem's text.\n\n*   **Summary of corrected identification:**\n    *   Y = Plutonium (Pu)\n    *   A1 = PuF6 (reddish-brown, decomposes at RT, oxidizes Xe)\n    *   A2 = PuF4 (product of A1 decomposition)\n\n*   **Compound A3**: \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"\n    The reaction is Pu + nF2 -> A3. PuF6 (A1) is a strong oxidizer. PuF4 (A2) is much more stable. PuF6 is made by fluorinating PuF4 at high temperatures, which is in turn made by fluorinating Pu. Direct fluorination of Pu can also yield PuF6. So, it is plausible that **A3 is PuF6** (same as A1).\n\n*   **Compounds A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" \"In water, A5 decomposes...\"\n    The reaction is Y + A4 -> A5, so **Pu + A4 -> A5**.\n    The five known binary fluorides of Plutonium are PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, and PuF6 (with PuF5 being unstable). PuF3 is the most reduced common fluoride.\n    This reaction (adding the metal Y to one of its fluorides A4) is a synproportionation reaction, where the metal reduces the fluoride to a lower oxidation state.\n    Let's test the possibilities for A4, which must be a stable fluoride higher than A5. A4 solution is also \"colorless\". Pu(III) salts are violet, Pu(IV) are brown/green, Pu(V) are pink, Pu(VI) are pink/orange. However, these are for aqueous solutions. In a non-aqueous solvent like anhydrous HF, fluoride complexes can have different colors. UF4 (analogous to PuF4) is green but can form colorless complexes. Let's assume a plausible reaction from known plutonium chemistry.\n    A well-known synproportionation is the reaction of plutonium metal with plutonium tetrafluoride to produce plutonium trifluoride:\n    **Pu + 3 PuF4 -> 4 PuF3**\n    The problem states a 1:1 molar ratio, not 1:3. Let's check another reaction:\n    **Pu + PuF6 -> 2 PuF4** (This is not 1:1 forming a single product A5)\n    The most likely intended reaction fitting the 1:1 stoichiometry for producing a single product is:\n    **Pu + 2PuF3 -> 3PuF2** (not 1:1)\n    However, the reaction between Pu and PuF4 to make PuF3 is fundamental. Perhaps the stoichiometry in the problem is simplified. Let's assume the most common species are involved. A reaction where a higher fluoride is reduced by the metal.\n    The most logical choice for this process is the reduction of PuF4 (A4) to PuF3 (A5).\n    So, let's identify:\n    *   **A4 = PuF4**\n    *   **A5 = PuF3**\n    The reaction is Pu + 3PuF4 → 4PuF3. While not 1:1, it's a known reaction to produce A5 from A4 and Y. Let's assume the problem's stoichiometry is a simplification and the chemical identity is key.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deductions, substance A4 is Plutonium Tetrafluoride (PuF4).\nWe calculate its molecular weight:\nM(PuF4) = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nM(PuF4) = 244 g/mol + 4 * 19 g/mol\nM(PuF4) = 244 + 76\nM(PuF4) = 320 g/mol\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nOur calculated molecular weight is 320 g/mol. None of the given ranges contain this value. This indicates a potential second error in the problem, either in the options provided or in our identification.\n\nLet's re-examine the last reaction step.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio)\nPu + A4 -> A5\nIf A4 were PuF6, then Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuFx. No single product.\nIf A4 were PuF3, what would it react with Pu to form? A lower fluoride? PuF2 is not a stable bulk compound.\nThis part of the problem is puzzling. Let's reconsider the whole chain.\n\nIs there any other element that fits? We found no other element that fits the mass percentage of A2 and the chemical properties of A1 as well as Plutonium. The logical contradiction must lie within the problem's statements.\n\nLet's assume our identification of **Y=Pu** and **A1=PuF6 -> A2=PuF4** is correct based on the strongest clues (color, reactivity, decomposition), and that the mass % for A2 was a typo for A1. This is the most consistent path.\n\nThis leaves the final reaction step and the final answer.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nPu + A4 -> A5\nLet's consider that the problem might be from a specific educational context where certain facts are canonical, even if unusual.\nWhat if A4 is not PuF4? Let's reconsider.\nA1=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A3=PuF6, A5=PuF3. What is A4?\n\"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 must be one of the 5 binary fluorides. Let's assume they are PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6 and some other.\nIf A4=PuF6, Pu + PuF6 -> 2 PuF4. This is a possibility if A5 is PuF4, but A2 is already PuF4.\nIf the five compounds are A1-A5, and A1=A3=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A5=PuF3. Then A4 is the only one left.\nBut we don't know the fifth fluoride.\n\nLet's rethink A4 -> A5 from a different angle.\nWhat if Y=Sb?\nA2=SbF3 (ɷF=31.88%). A1->SbF3+F2, so A1=SbF5. But SbF5 is not red. This path fails early.\n\nLet's stick with Pu being the most likely element despite the contradictions. The error seems to be in the problem's data (mass%, stoichiometry, or final options). Let's search for the molecular weight of any of the identified Pu fluorides in the options.\nM(PuF6) = 358 g/mol\nM(PuF4) = 320 g/mol\nM(PuF3) = 301 g/mol\nNone of these fit in any range.\n\nThere must be another interpretation. Let's go back to the list of candidates from the mass percentage of A2.\nA2 = AuF5 (ɷF=32.53%)? Y=Au. A1=AuF7? No. A1 could be the red dimer [AuF5]2. But it decomposes to monomeric AuF5, not A2+F2. This path is weak.\nA2 = UF6 (ɷF=32.38%)? Y=U. A1 would be UFx (>6), which doesn't exist. This path is weak.\n\nLet's reconsider the decomposition A1 -> A2 + F2 and the red color. This combination is rare. Besides PuF6, KrF4 is a possibility. Let's assume Y=Kr.\nA2 = KrF2 (ɷF=31.2%). This is a bit far from 31.96%.\nIf A2=KrF2, then A1=KrF4. A1 is reddish and decomposes to A2+F2. This fits. A1 and A3 (KrF2?) oxidize Xe. Fits.\nNow the final step: Y + A4 -> A5.\nKr + A4 -> A5.\nKrypton, a noble gas, reacting with one of its own fluorides in a synproportionation reaction is extremely unlikely. This path fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem entirely. What if the description of A1 being \"bright-red\" is the key?\nRed binary fluorides: Au2F10, V F5, PuF6, NpF6.\nThe most likely scenario remains an error in the problem. However, a choice must be made. Let's assume there is a non-obvious element that fits. Let's re-examine the M(Y) list.\n\nx=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8. Element Dy (162.5). Could A2=DyF4? Dy is a lanthanide, typically forming +3 ions. DyF4 exists but is not common. Let's calculate ɷF(DyF4) = (4*19)/(162.5 + 76) = 76 / 238.5 = 31.86%. This is an excellent match to 31.96%!\nSo let's proceed with Y=Dy and A2=DyF4.\n*   Y = Dysprosium (Dy)\n*   A2 = DyF4 (ɷF=31.86%)\n*   A1: Decomposes to A2 + F2. So A1 = DyF5? Not known. Is DyF4 \"bright-red\"? No available information suggests this. Can it oxidize Xe? Highly unlikely for a lanthanide fluoride. This path fails on the chemical properties.\n\nLet's take a step back and assume there's a simple answer we missed, likely due to a faulty premise. The Pu hypothesis is chemically the most sound, but leads to a numeric mismatch with the options. If we are forced to choose an answer, there must be a flaw in our identification of A4.\nPu + A4 -> A5.\nMaybe A4 isn't a simple fluoride, but a complex in solution? No, \"binary compounds\".\nWhat if A4 is from a completely different element system? No, it's one of the five fluorides of Y.\n\nLet's assume the molecular weight of *one of the compounds* A1-A5 must fit an answer.\nA1=PuF6 (358)\nA2=PuF4 (320)\nA3=PuF6 (358)\nA4=?\nA5=PuF3 (301)\nNone fit. This indicates Y is not Pu, or the options are for another element.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. ɷF=31.88% (excellent fit).\nA1 -> SbF3 + F2. Thus A1=SbF5. But SbF5 is colorless, not red. This is a fatal flaw.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. Sb + A4 -> A5. A4=SbF5, A5=SbF3.\n2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. This is a known reaction. A4=SbF5, A5=SbF3.\nSo we have:\nY=Sb\nA1=SbF5 (color mismatch)\nA2=SbF3\nA3=SbF5 (obtained by F2 on Sb, oxidizes Xe through formation of adducts like [XeF]+[Sb2F11]-)\nA4=SbF5\nA5=SbF3\nThe only inconsistency is the color of A1. If we ignore that one word, everything else fits. What is the molecular weight of A4?\nA4 = SbF5.\nM(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = 216.76 g/mol.\nThis value does not fit in any of the ranges.\n\nThere is a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement as written. No single element satisfies all conditions simultaneously. However, in such cases, one must find the 'least wrong' answer.\nThe match between A2 and DyF4 on mass % is nearly perfect. Let's revisit that.\nY=Dy, A2=DyF4. Let's assume the other chemical facts are \"bent\" to fit.\nWhat would A4 be? Dysprosium chemistry is dominated by DyF3. The reduction of DyF4 by Dy metal would produce DyF3.\nSo, A4=DyF4, A5=DyF3.\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. A4 = DyF4.\nMW(DyF4) = 162.5 + 4*19 = 162.5 + 76 = 238.5 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range D) 220-240.\nLet's check if this path is plausible.\nA1->DyF4+F2 implies A1=DyF5 (hypothetical). Assume it's red and oxidizes Xe.\nA3 also oxidizes Xe. A3=DyF4? Unlikely.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1). Dy + DyF4 -> DyF3? No, Dy + 3DyF4 -> 4DyF3.\nThis path is also full of holes.\n\nLet's return to the most plausible chemical story (Pu) and assume the options are wrong.\nLet's assume the identification of A4 is wrong, but Y is still Pu. Could A4 be something else with MW in a given range?\nRange D is 220-240. PuFx cannot have this MW.\nLet's assume Y is wrong, and work backwards from the answer.\nIf answer D is correct, MW(A4) is between 220-240. We found MW(DyF4)=238.5. This is the only candidate whose fluoride (A4) fits an answer range, and whose *other* fluoride (A2) perfectly matches the given mass percent. The problem's author likely constructed it around Dy, even though the chemical properties (red color, Xe oxidation) are unrealistic for Dysprosium and were probably borrowed from other elements to make the problem more challenging. Therefore, the intended answer path is likely:\n1. Use ɷF = 31.96% to find A2. This leads to M(Y)≈40.45x. For x=4, M(Y)≈161.8, which points to Dy. ɷF(DyF4)=31.86%, a near-perfect match. So A2=DyF4.\n2. The reaction Y+A4->A5 is a reduction of a higher fluoride by the metal. The common fluorides are DyF3 and DyF4. This suggests A4=DyF4 being reduced to A5=DyF3.\n3. The question asks for MW of A4. Calculate MW(DyF4). MW = 162.5 + 4*19 = 238.5 g/mol.\n4. This value falls into the range 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct substance and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**: The substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the formula YFₓ, where Y is the element and x is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. The formula for mass percentage is:\n\n    ɷF = (x * Atomic Mass of F) / (Atomic Mass of Y + x * Atomic Mass of F)\n\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\n    Solving for M(Y), we get: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x.\n\n    We can test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y:\n    *   If x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium).\n    *   If x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (similar to Bromine).\n    *   If x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol) and Iodine (I, 126.90 g/mol).\n    *   If x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol.\n    *   If x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n\n    Let's check the mass percentages for the most likely candidates:\n    *   For **SbF₃**: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   For **IF₃**: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (126.90 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 183.90 ≈ 30.99%. This is a less accurate match.\n\n    The excellent match for Antimony suggests **Y is likely Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Other Clues with Y = Sb**:\n    *   **A3 from Y + F₂**: The fluorination of antimony with fluorine produces antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   **A3 oxidizes xenon**: Antimony pentafluoride is a very strong Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon. This fits.\n    *   **The Reaction to form A5**: The problem states that adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 ratio yields A5. The most plausible reaction involving elemental antimony and an antimony fluoride is the comproportionation: `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. In this reaction, A4 would be SbF₅ and A5 would be SbF₃. While the problem states a 1:1 molar ratio which contradicts this balanced equation, it's common in such problems for stoichiometry to be simplified or stated incorrectly. The chemical transformation itself is sound.\n    *   **A4 is a colorless solution**: Antimony pentafluoride is a colorless, viscous liquid that can form a solution.\n    *   **A5 decomposition in water**: A5 (identified as SbF₃) hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which are two different substances. This also fits.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the analysis, A4 is identified as antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Now, we calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molecular Weight (SbF₅) = Atomic Mass of Sb + 5 * Atomic Mass of F\n    *   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Consider the Iodine (I) Alternative and the Options**: If we assume Y is Iodine, then A4 would likely be IF₅.\n    *   Molecular Weight (IF₅) = 126.90 + 5 * 18.998 = 221.89 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls perfectly into the range **A) 220-240**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: There is a conflict between the clues. The mass percentage strongly points to Antimony (Y=Sb), but the resulting molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅, 216.75 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges neatly. The Iodine hypothesis (Y=I) has a less perfect mass percentage match but results in a molecular weight for A4 (IF₅, 221.89 g/mol) that fits perfectly into range A. In chemical problems of this nature, a perfect fit into a given numerical range is often the intended path. Therefore, despite the discrepancy in the initial mass percentage calculation, the most logical conclusion is that Y is Iodine and A4 is IF₅. The clues about the bright-red substance A1 and the \"five binary compounds\" are likely distractors or apply to obscure chemical knowledge, a common feature in competitive chemistry questions.\n\nThus, the substance A4 is Iodine Pentafluoride (IF₅), and its molecular weight (221.9 g/mol) falls within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nBased on the chemical properties described, the identity of the substances can be determined, which in turn allows for the calculation of the molecular weight of substance A4.\n\n*   **Identifying Element Y and Substances A1, A2, A3:** The \"bright-red substance\" A1 that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions is a classic description of **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. This identifies element **Y** as **Platinum (Pt)**. The decomposition of A1 produces fluorine and A2. PtF₆ decomposes into **Platinum pentafluoride (PtF₅)** and fluorine, making **A2 = PtF₅**. A3, which is obtained by fluorinating element Y and also interacts with xenon, can be identified as **Platinum tetrafluoride (PtF₄)**.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance A4:** The problem states that A5 is formed by adding element Y (Platinum) to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". The platinum fluorides themselves are colored (PtF₆ is dark-red, PtF₄ is red-orange). This suggests A4 is not a binary fluoride of platinum. The fact that A1 and A3 react with xenon introduces xenon compounds as plausible reactants. A key candidate for A4 is **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂)**. Xenon difluoride is a colorless crystalline solid that can be dissolved to form a colorless solution. It is also a powerful fluorinating agent capable of reacting with platinum metal.\n\n*   **The Reaction and Identifying A5:** The reaction between platinum metal (Y) and a solution of xenon difluoride (A4) in a 1:1 molar ratio would proceed as follows:\n    Pt + XeF₂ → PtF₂ + Xe\n    This reaction is plausible, with platinum being oxidized and xenon being reduced. This identifies substance A5 as **Platinum difluoride (PtF₂)**. The final clue states that A5 decomposes in water. Indeed, platinum(II) fluoride is known to be hydrolyzed by water.\n\n*   **Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4:** Now that A4 has been identified as Xenon difluoride (XeF₂), its molecular weight can be calculated.\n    *   Atomic weight of Xenon (Xe) ≈ 131.29 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of XeF₂ = 131.29 + (2 × 19.00) = **169.29 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:**\n    *   The prompt states that element Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine. This is a rare property. Gold (Au) is a known element that forms five such compounds: AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with the clue that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine implies A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2.\n    *   Let's calculate the ɷF for the higher gold fluorides:\n        *   For AuF₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 254 g/mol): ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 254.0 = 22.4%\n        *   For AuF₅ (Molar Mass ≈ 292 g/mol): ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / 292.0 = 32.5%\n    *   The calculated mass percentage for AuF₅ (32.5%) is a very close match to the given 31.96%. Thus, we can confidently identify **A2 as AuF₅**. This strongly supports the hypothesis that **Y is Gold (Au)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A2, and A3:**\n    *   **A2** is **AuF₅**.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (AuF₅) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of gold, which is **AuF₇**. The description of A1 as a powerful oxidizing agent that can react with xenon is consistent with a high-oxidation-state fluoride. Gold(V) fluoride, the core of this compound, is also described as a red solid.\n    *   **A3** is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Au). The direct reaction of gold with fluorine typically produces **AuF₃**. AuF₃ is also a powerful fluorinating agent and could interact with xenon as stated.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   The five binary fluorides are AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇. We have assigned A1, A2, and A3, leaving AuF and AuF₂ for A4 and A5.\n    *   The crucial clue is the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: **Au + A4 → A5**.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction, where gold in different oxidation states reacts to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test the possibility where **A4 = AuF₂** and **A5 = AuF**. The reaction would be:\n        Au(0) + Au(II)F₂ → 2Au(I)F\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and chemically plausible. Importantly, the reactants Au (Y) and AuF₂ (A4) are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, perfectly matching the clue. The substance obtained is AuF (A5).\n    *   The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is also consistent, as AuF is unstable and would disproportionate in water.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Based on the deduction, substance **A4 is AuF₂** (gold(II) fluoride).\n    *   The molecular weight (molar mass) of AuF₂ is calculated as follows:\n        *   Atomic weight of Gold (Au) ≈ 196.97 g/mol\n        *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   Molecular Weight of AuF₂ = 196.97 + (2 * 18.998) = **234.966 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (≈235 g/mol) falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the element, M(Y) is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M(Y) + 19n)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element Y:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca=40.1)\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br=79.9)\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy=162.5)\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (in the region of Bi, Pb, Hg)\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu=244)\n\n    Let's check the most promising candidate, **Y = Sb (Antimony)**, with **n = 3**.\n    A2 would be **SbF₃**. Let's verify the mass percentage:\n    ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.25%. This makes Antimony the most likely candidate for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the other compounds and reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Antimony forms SbF₃ and SbF₅ as its main stable binary fluorides, but other less stable or polymeric species are known, making this plausible.\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. By mass balance, A1 must be **SbF₅**. A1 also oxidizes xenon, which is a known property of the extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent SbF₅. (Note: The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" contradicts the known properties of pure SbF₅, which is a colorless liquid/solid stable at that temperature. This is likely an error or misleading information in the problem statement).\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and it also interacts with xenon. Fluorination of Sb with excess fluorine produces SbF₅, which reacts with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 is one of the binary fluorides of Antimony. The two main possibilities are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n    Now let's check the given answer ranges:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly into range **C) 160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the ranges. It is closest to D, but outside the specified limits.\n\n    This provides strong evidence that **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Final consistency check.**\n    The problem states \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" With A4=SbF₃ and Y=Sb, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. The stoichiometry of known reactions (e.g., `2Sb + SbF₃ → 3SbF`) does not match the 1:1 ratio. Similar to the properties of A1, this part of the problem statement may be flawed or refer to an obscure reaction. However, the numerical fit from the mass percentage of A2 and the molecular weight of A4 with the given options is too strong to ignore. These numerical clues are the most reliable path to the solution.\n\nConclusion: Based on the mass percentage, element Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃. Based on the provided molecular weight ranges, A4 must be SbF₃, as its molecular weight of ~179 g/mol falls into the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying an element, Y, and its five binary fluoride compounds (A1 to A5). The solution hinges on a combination of quantitative analysis and knowledge of chemical properties.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Substance A2**\n\nThe key piece of information is that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y. Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\nM(Y) = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe must now test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, which is unlikely to form five fluorides and the described compounds).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, which does not fit the subsequent clues).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n\nLet's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in antimony trifluoride (SbF₃):\n*   Molar mass of SbF₃ = 121.76 + (3 × 19.00) = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   Mass fraction of F = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n\nThis calculated value of 31.88% is an excellent match for the given 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances**\n\nWith Y=Sb and A2=SbF₃, we can deduce the identities of the other substances. The known binary fluorides of antimony are primarily SbF₃ and SbF₅. For the purpose of this problem, we assume the existence of five binary compounds as stated.\n\n*   **A1**: This bright-red substance decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, which would be SbF₅. While SbF₅ is typically described as a colorless liquid, the qualitative descriptions in such problems can sometimes be idealized or misleading. The decomposition reaction described (SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂) occurs at high temperatures, not at 293 K, which is another discrepancy, but the chemical identity is the most plausible.\n*   **A3**: This compound is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. The direct, vigorous fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to react with xenon fluorides, thus it \"interacts with xenon\". So, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The problem states that adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 yields A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction where an element in a zero oxidation state reacts with one of its compounds to form a product of an intermediate oxidation state. Given the known chemistry of antimony, a likely, albeit stoichiometrically simplified, intended reaction involves Sb and SbF₅ to produce SbF₃. However, the question asks for the molecular weight of **A4**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nA4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony. The most common and stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. Let's examine their molecular weights:\n*   **MW of SbF₃**: 178.76 g/mol.\n*   **MW of SbF₅**: 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's compare these to the given ranges:\n*   A) 220-240\n*   B) 160-180\n*   C) 140-160\n*   D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within the range of **160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the provided ranges. This strongly suggests that A4 is SbF₃.\n\nAlthough there are contradictions in the qualitative descriptions of the reactions and properties, the quantitative data (mass percentage and molecular weight) point consistently towards this solution.\n\nThe molecular weight of substance A4 is therefore in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is its oxidation state.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    Let's rearrange to solve for the molar mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y = (n * M_F / ɷF) - (n * M_F) = n * M_F * (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Using the molar mass of fluorine (M_F ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the given percentage (ɷF = 0.3196):\n    M_Y ≈ n * 19.00 * (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ n * 19.00 * (3.129 - 1) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol.\n    We can test plausible integer values for n (common oxidation states):\n    *   If n=1, M_Y ≈ 40.5 g/mol (Close to K, Ca, Ar - unlikely candidates for forming five binary fluorides and reacting with Xenon).\n    *   If n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Br, M=79.9 g/mol. A possibility).\n    *   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol (Very close to Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol. A strong candidate).\n    *   If n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No stable element).\n    *   If n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.3 g/mol (Close to Bi, Bismuth, M=208.98 g/mol. A possibility).\n\n    Let's calculate the theoretical ɷF for the most likely candidates to see which is the best fit:\n    *   For BrF2 (assuming n=2, Y=Br): ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (79.90 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 117.90 = 32.23%\n    *   For SbF3 (assuming n=3, Y=Sb): ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 31.88%\n    *   For BiF5 (assuming n=5, Y=Bi): ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / (208.98 + 5 * 19.00) = 95 / 303.98 = 31.25%\n\n    Comparing these to the given value of 31.96%, SbF3 (31.88%) is by far the closest match. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances A1, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   **A1 & A3**: The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon and A3 is formed by fluorinating Y and also reacts with xenon. Strong fluorinating agents like SbF5 are known to react with xenon. SbF3 does not. This identifies **A1 = A3 = SbF5**. The information about A1 being red and decomposing is likely related to its high reactivity or impurities, as pure SbF5 is colorless.\n    *   **A4 & A5**: The key reaction is \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    This is a comproportionation reaction, where elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) reduces the antimony in A4 to a lower oxidation state in A5. Given the common fluorides are SbF3 (+3) and SbF5 (+5), the only logical transformation is the reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III).\n    Thus, **A4 = SbF5** and **A5 = SbF3**.\n    The 1:1 molar ratio likely refers to the recipe for the synthesis, not the balanced chemical equation (which is 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3).\n    The final clue supports this: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 is SbF3. The hydrolysis of antimony trifluoride (SbF3 + H₂O → SbOF + 2HF) produces two new substances: antimony oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    We have identified A4 as Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5). We will now calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Molar Mass of Antimony (Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of SbF5 = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    We compare the calculated molecular weight (216.75 g/mol) to the given ranges:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n    The calculated value of 216.75 g/mol is not strictly within any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range D. This suggests a potential small error in the problem's ranges.

The reaction is: A1 → A2 + F2. This means A1 is a higher fluoride of element Y than A2.\n*   We are given the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the general formula YF_n, where Y is the element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)), where M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol and M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n*   We can write: 0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19).\n*   Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n - (0.3196 × 19n)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n × (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n × 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n*   Now we test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y in A2):\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (fits Potassium or Calcium, which do not form the described compounds).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (fits Bromine, but its fluorides don't match other criteria).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's test this candidate.\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no suitable element).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Gold, Bismuth, etc., but the fit is not as good).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (fits Plutonium (Pu), M=244 g/mol). Let's check ɷF in PuF6: (6*19)/(244+114) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is also a very good fit. However, if A2=PuF6, A1 would have to be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF7 or PuF8), which is not known to exist. Therefore, the Plutonium hypothesis is invalid.\n*   The best candidate is **Y = Antimony (Sb)**. Let's verify the mass percent for A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19 = 178.76 g/mol. ɷF = (3 × 19) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Identify A1, A2, and A3 based on Y=Sb.**\n*   Y = Sb.\n*   A2 = SbF3.\n*   From the decomposition A1 → A2 + F2, we get A1 → SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 = SbF5. The reaction is SbF5 → SbF3 + F2.\n*   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. Sb + F2 → SbF5 is a standard reaction. A3 reacts with xenon. SbF5 is a strong Lewis acid and reacts with XeF2 to form complexes like [XeF]+[SbF6]-, thus it \"interacts with xenon\". So A3 = SbF5.\n*   There are some inconsistencies: The problem says A1 is a \"bright-red substance\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid. It also states five binary fluorides are known, whereas only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, as the quantitative data points strongly to Sb.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction involving A4 and A5.**\n*   The clue is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" With Y=Sb, the reaction is:\n    Sb + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n*   The final clue is: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" This is characteristic of the hydrolysis of antimony halides. For example, antimony(III) chloride hydrolyzes: SbCl3 + H2O → SbOCl(s) + 2HCl(aq). This produces two substances (antimony oxychloride and hydrochloric acid).\n*   Let's assume A5 is an antimony(III) halide, like SbCl3, as it fits the hydrolysis description.\n*   If A5 = SbCl3, the reaction becomes: Sb + A4 → SbCl3 (1:1).\n*   This suggests a displacement reaction where A4 is a chloride of a less reactive element, X: Sb + XCl3 → SbCl3 + X. This reaction is 1:1.\n*   We need to find a substance A4=XCl3 that fits the following criteria:\n    1.  X is less reactive (less metallic) than Sb.\n    2.  The reaction Sb + XCl3 → SbCl3 + X proceeds.\n    3.  A solution of XCl3 is colorless.\n    4.  The molecular weight of XCl3 falls into one of the given ranges.\n*   Let's check candidates for X. A neighboring element in the periodic table is a good place to start. Antimony (Sb) is more metallic than Arsenic (As). Thus, the reaction `Sb + AsCl3 → SbCl3 + As` is favorable.\n*   Let's check if A4 = AsCl3 fits the remaining criteria.\n    *   **Color:** AsCl3 is a colorless fuming oily liquid. Its solution is colorless. This fits.\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** M(AsCl3) = M(As) + 3 × M(Cl) ≈ 74.92 + 3 × 35.45 = 74.92 + 106.35 = 181.27 g/mol.\n    *   **Check ranges:** The calculated molecular weight of 181.27 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n*   All the chemical evidence from the second part of the problem consistently points to A4 being Arsenic trichloride (AsCl3).\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A4 = AsCl3\n*   A5 = SbCl3\n*   The molecular weight of A4 (AsCl3) is ~181.3 g/mol.\n*   This falls into the range provided by option C.\n\nThe molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe step-by-step reasoning has led to the identification of the unknown element Y and the specific compounds involved.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** From the information that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass, we deduced the atomic mass of element Y.\n    Let the atomic mass of Y be Ar(Y) and the formula of A2 be Y_mF_n.\n    The mass fraction of F is: ɷ(F) = (n * Ar(F)) / (m * Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (m * Ar(Y) + n * 18.998)\n    Rearranging for Ar(Y): Ar(Y) ≈ (n/m) * 40.445\n    Testing simple integer ratios for n/m, a ratio of 5/2 gives Ar(Y) ≈ 101.1 g/mol, which corresponds to Ruthenium (Ru, atomic weight 101.07 g/mol). So, Y is Ru and A2 is Ru2F5.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5:** The problem states that adding Y (Ru metal) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio produces A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction. A likely reaction following a 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n    Ru + RuF4 → 2RuF2\n    In this case, A4 would be RuF4 and A5 would be RuF2.\n\n3.  **Verify with Other Clues:** The final clue is that A5 (RuF2) decomposes in water into two substances. This is consistent with the hydrolysis of a metal fluoride:\n    RuF2 + 2H2O → Ru(OH)2 + 2HF\n    This produces two substances: ruthenium(II) hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid. Thus, our identification of A4 as RuF4 is well-supported.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weight of A4:** Now we calculate the molecular weight of A4 (RuF4).\n    MW(RuF4) = Ar(Ru) + 4 * Ar(F)\n    MW(RuF4) = 101.07 + 4 * 18.998\n    MW(RuF4) = 101.07 + 75.992 = 177.062 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:** The calculated molecular weight is 177.062 g/mol. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 220-240\n\nThe value 177.062 falls squarely within the range 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nBased on the analysis of the provided information, the most chemically consistent hypothesis identifies element Y as Iodine (I).\n\n*   **Element Y and its fluorides:** Y is identified as Iodine (I). Iodine is known to form several binary fluorides, including IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇, satisfying the condition of forming multiple such compounds.\n\n*   **Identification of A2 and A4:** The mass percentage of fluorine in substance A2 is given as 31.96%. Iodine trifluoride (IF₃) has a fluorine content of approximately 31.0%. This is a reasonable match. The substance A4 is identified through the reaction where element Y (Iodine, I₂) is added to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. The known comproportionation reaction `I₂ + IF₃ → 3IF` fits this description perfectly. Therefore, **A4 is Iodine Trifluoride (IF₃)** and A5 is Iodine Monofluoride (IF). Since the fluorine percentage matches A2, A2 is also IF₃.\n\n*   **Identification of A1:** Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine. This implies that A1 must be a higher fluoride of iodine, such as IF₅ or IF₇. The reaction `IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂` is plausible. A1 is also described as a strong oxidizing agent that can oxidize xenon, a known property of higher iodine fluorides. The clue about A1 being a \"bright-red substance\" contradicts the fact that IF₅ is a colorless liquid; this is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as the rest of the chemical evidence strongly supports the iodine hypothesis.\n\n*   **Identification of A3:** A3 is formed by the fluorination of iodine and can also react with xenon. This could be any of the higher iodine fluorides, like IF₅ or IF₇, which are produced by the direct reaction of iodine and fluorine.\n\nWith A4 identified as IF₃, we can determine its molecular weight.\n*   The molecular formula for A4 is IF₃.\n*   The atomic weight of Iodine (I) is approximately 126.9 g/mol.\n*   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.0 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of IF₃ = 126.9 + (3 × 19.0) = 126.9 + 57.0 = 183.9 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (183.9 g/mol) fits into the range given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the substance A4:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The clue that substance A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions is critical. The first compound of a noble gas was created in 1962 by Neil Bartlett when he reacted platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) with xenon. This strongly suggests that element **Y is Platinum (Pt)**. A1, the bright-red substance, is **platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A2:** The problem states that A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%. Let's examine the known fluorides of platinum.\n    *   **Platinum(V) fluoride (PtF₅):** It exists as a deep-red solid tetramer [PtF₅]₄. The mass percentage of fluorine in the PtF₅ monomer is 32.75%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem, with the small difference likely due to rounding in the problem's data. Therefore, **A2 is PtF₅**. The decomposition is PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½F₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A3:** A3 is obtained by fluorinating platinum and can also interact with xenon. Platinum tetrafluoride (PtF₄) can be formed by the direct fluorination of platinum. Furthermore, platinum reacts with xenon tetrafluoride to produce platinum tetrafluoride and xenon gas (XeF₄ + Pt → PtF₄ + Xe), which qualifies as an interaction. Thus, **A3 is PtF₄**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4:** This is the core of the problem. Here is what we know about A4:\n    *   It exists as a hot, colorless, concentrated solution.\n    *   Platinum metal (Y) is added to this solution in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5.\n    *   The known simple platinum fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆) are all colored solids and would not form a colorless solution. Platinum(II) fluoride is insoluble in water. This suggests A4 is not one of the simple binary fluorides of platinum.\n    *   The problem's context is rich with platinum and xenon chemistry. Therefore, A4 is likely another fluorine-containing compound, possibly another strong fluorinating agent. Candidates include interhalogen compounds or other xenon fluorides.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidates for A4 based on Molecular Weight:**\n    *   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆):** This is a strong fluorinating agent. It is a colorless solid that could form a colorless solution. It reacts with platinum. The products of this reaction would be various platinum fluorides, which are known to decompose in water. The molecular weight of XeF₆ is approximately 245.3 g/mol. This value falls into the range of **220-240**.\n    *   **Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅):** This is another strong, colorless fluorinating agent. It has a molecular weight of approximately 221.9 g/mol. This value also falls into the range of **220-240**.\n\nBoth XeF₆ and IF₅ fit the description and lead to the same molecular weight range. Given the thematic consistency with xenon chemistry throughout the problem, XeF₆ is a particularly fitting candidate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecular weight of substance A4 must fall within the 220-240 g/mol range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of the substances and the molecular weight of A4:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2**: The clue states that A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, the atomic mass of Y be M(Y), and the atomic mass of F be 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    If we test different integer values for n, we can find a corresponding mass for Y. Rearranging the formula: M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / ɷF) - (n * 19.00).\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    While several possibilities exist, the other clues point strongly towards a specific element.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues for A1 and its Relationship to A2**:\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). This means A1 is a higher, less stable fluoride of Y than A2.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions, indicating it is a very powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   This set of properties (color, decomposition to a lower fluoride and F₂, extreme oxidizing power) is characteristic of Krypton's chemistry. Specifically, Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄) was once claimed to be a bright-red or white solid that is highly unstable at room temperature and decomposes to Krypton Difluoride (KrF₂) and Fluorine. Reports on the existence and color of KrF₄ vary, and it is considered hypothetical or only stable under high pressure by modern sources. However, within the context of a chemical puzzle, these historical or theoretical properties are often used as clues. Let's assume **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n    *   This makes **A1 = KrF₄** and **A2 = KrF₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify the Mass Percentage for KrF₂**:\n    *   The molar mass of Kr is 83.80 g/mol.\n    *   The molar mass of KrF₂ is 83.80 + 2 * 19.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of F in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / 121.80 = 31.2%.\n    *   This is reasonably close to the given value of 31.96%. Small discrepancies are common in such problems.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Kr) and can also interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of krypton produces krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is a powerful oxidizing agent and can oxidize xenon to xenon hexafluoride. Thus, **A3 is KrF₂**.\n\n5.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5**:\n    *   The key clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This translates to the reaction: **Kr + A4 → A5** (1:1 ratio).\n    *   A4 is one of the five binary krypton fluorides and its solution is colorless. KrF₂ forms a colorless solid and its solutions are also colorless. KrF₄ is described as a red or white solid. Let's examine the possible reactions.\n    *   If **A4 = KrF₂**, the reaction would be Kr + KrF₂ → A5. There is no common, simple reaction product (A5) for this 1:1 reaction.\n    *   If **A4 = KrF₄**, the reaction would be Kr + KrF₄ → A5. This corresponds to a known synproportionation reaction: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂**. This reaction proceeds with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n    *   This suggests that **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   This interpretation contradicts the clue that the solution of A4 is \"colorless\". However, the specific 1:1 molar ratio strongly points to a defined chemical equation, which is often a more reliable clue in chemical puzzles than a descriptive property that might be simplified or contain an error.\n    *   The final clue, \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\", fits this interpretation. A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water to form Krypton (Kr) and Oxygen (O₂), along with hydrofluoric acid. The \"two substances\" likely refer to the elemental products Kr and O₂.\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the analysis, A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of KrF₄ = MW(Kr) + 4 * MW(F)\n    *   MW(KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 * 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls into the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the formula YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_F is the atomic mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y.\n*   n is an integer.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM_Y = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nM_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y with atomic mass M_Y:\n*   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Ca). Unlikely to form the described compounds.\n*   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Br). Chemistry doesn't fit well.\n*   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol).\n*   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, M ≈ 162.5 g/mol).\n*   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol. (e.g., Gold, Au, M=197).\n*   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the mass percentages for the best candidates precisely:\n*   **Y=Sb, n=3 (A2=SbF₃)**: M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76. ɷF = (57/178.76) * 100% = **31.88%**. (Excellent match)\n*   **Y=Dy, n=4 (A2=DyF₄)**: M(DyF₄) = 162.5 + 4*19.00 = 238.5. ɷF = (76/238.5) * 100% = **31.86%**. (Excellent match)\n*   **Y=Pu, n=6 (A2=PuF₆)**: M(PuF₆) = 244 + 6*19.00 = 358. ɷF = (114/358) * 100% = **31.84%**. (Excellent match)\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical plausibility of each candidate.**\n\nWe must now use the other chemical clues to decide between Sb, Dy, and Pu.\n\n*   **Pu Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage for PuF₆ is a good fit for A2, other clues create contradictions. For instance, A1 decomposes to A2 and fluorine. The only known decomposition of this type is PuF₆ → PuF₄ + F₂. This would imply A1=PuF₆ and A2=PuF₄. But we identified A2 as PuF₆ from the mass percent. This is a fatal contradiction.\n\n*   **Sb Hypothesis**: Antimony chemistry is very rich with fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅, and various mixed-valence compounds like SbF₄, Sb₂F₇), fitting the \"five binary compounds\" clue. Many of the qualitative clues fit if one assumes errors in the problem statement (a common trait of olympiad-style problems). For example, A3, which reacts with Xe, is likely SbF₅. A1 decomposing to A2(SbF₃) would imply A1=SbF₅, but the properties don't match and it creates an identity clash with A3. If we proceed by identifying A4, the most plausible candidate is SbF₅ (as it's a liquid and can be a \"concentrated solution\"). Its molecular weight is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the given ranges, although it is very close to range A [220-240]. This discrepancy suggests this might not be the intended answer.\n\n*   **Dy Hypothesis**: Let's test the Dysprosium case, which also had an excellent mass percentage match.\n    *   Y = Dy, **A2 = DyF₄**.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\". This implies A1 → DyF₄ + F₂, which means **A1 = DyF₆**. DyF₆ is not a stable, known compound, but may be assumed to exist for the problem.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" This suggests A3 is a strong oxidizer, like DyF₆ or possibly DyF₄.\n    *   \"A5 is obtained by adding Y (Dy) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This is a comproportionation reaction: `Dy(0) + A4 -> A5`. This means A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\". Let's test the hydrolysis of dysprosium fluorides. `DyF₃ + 3H₂O → Dy(OH)₃↓ + 3HF`. This produces two substances, a solid precipitate and an aqueous acid. So, a plausible candidate for **A5 is DyF₃**.\n    *   Now, let's identify A4 from the reaction: `Dy + A4 → A5(DyF₃)`. To produce Dy(III)F₃ from Dy(0), A4 must be a fluoride with an oxidation state higher than +3. The logical choice is **A4 = DyF₄**. The balanced reaction is `Dy + 3DyF₄ → 4DyF₃`. The 1:1 ratio given in the problem is inconsistent, which is a common issue in such problems.\n    *   This hypothesis provides a full (though not perfectly consistent) set of assignments for the compounds. Crucially, it identifies A4.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nBased on the Dysprosium hypothesis, **A4 is DyF₄**.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(DyF₄) = M(Dy) + 4 * M(F)\nM(DyF₄) = 162.5 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol\nM(DyF₄) = 162.5 + 76.0\nM(DyF₄) = **238.5 g/mol**\n\nNow, we check which of the given ranges contains this value:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 238.5 g/mol falls squarely within the range **220-240**. While the Dysprosium chemistry is exotic, it provides a numerically perfect answer, which is often the intended solution path when the problem text contains inconsistencies.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y.**\n    *   We are given that substance A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, F is fluorine, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M_Y is the molar mass of Y, and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol).\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F).\n    *   Substituting the given values: 0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00).\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for M_Y: M_Y = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n = 19.00n * (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ 40.45n.\n    *   We need to find a plausible element Y by testing integer values for n. The element Y is known to form five binary compounds with fluorine. This points towards elements that can exhibit multiple oxidation states, such as p-block nonmetals or certain transition metals.\n    *   Let's test values of n:\n        *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca). Unlikely to form five fluorides.\n        *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se). Plausible.\n        *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Plausible.\n        *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy). Unlikely.\n        *   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Hg). Unlikely.\n        *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Am). Unlikely.\n    *   The statement that A1 (a fluoride of Y) \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\" is a very strong clue. Only a few substances are powerful enough to do this. The fluorides of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and krypton (Kr) are known for this reactivity.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities against our calculated M_Y.\n        *   If Y = Kr (M_Y = 83.8 g/mol), for n=2, our formula gives M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is a very close match.\n        *   If Y = Pt (M_Y = 195.08 g/mol), no integer n gives a close match.\n        *   If Y = Ru (M_Y = 101.07 g/mol), for n=2.5 (not an integer, so not a simple binary compound), M_Y would be ~101.1 g/mol.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) is the most likely candidate for Y. Krypton forms several binary fluorides: KrF2, KrF4, and potentially others under specific conditions. While \"five\" might be a slight exaggeration or include unstable/matrix-isolated species, the chemical properties strongly point towards Kr.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   Let's assume Y = Kr.\n    *   A2 has the formula YF_n. Since we found n=2 gives the best fit for the molar mass, A2 is **KrF2**.\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine (F2). This implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2. The next known fluoride is **KrF4**. The decomposition reaction is: KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 is known to be unstable, decomposing above -30 °C (243 K), which fits the description of decomposing at 293 K (20 °C). The description \"bright-red\" may be an inaccuracy, as it's typically described as a volatile white solid, but chemical properties are a stronger indicator than color in such problems. A1's ability to oxidize xenon is consistent with it being a powerful fluorinating agent like KrF4.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Kr) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. This is the synthesis of **KrF2** or **KrF4** from the elements. Kr + F2 → KrF2. As KrF4 (A1) also fits this description, A3 is likely KrF2. The interaction with xenon could be a ligand exchange or further oxidation under specific conditions. Let's tentatively assign A3 as KrF2.\n    *   Now, let's identify A4 and A5. A5 is obtained by adding Y (Kr) to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 is another binary compound of fluorine and Y (Krypton). The most stable and common fluoride of krypton is KrF2 (A2). It's plausible that the other fluorides mentioned are Lewis acid-base adducts with KrF2. For example, KrF2 can react with strong Lewis acids like AsF5 and SbF5.\n    *   A strong candidate for A4 is a Lewis acid that can form an adduct with KrF2. The elements near Krypton that form strong fluoride Lewis acids are in Group 15, namely Arsenic (As) and Antimony (Sb).\n    *   Let's consider the reaction: `A4 + Kr -> A5` (1:1 molar ratio). If A4 is a krypton-fluorine compound, this reaction is unclear. It is more likely that the problem description meant \"A5 is obtained by adding **A2** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio\". This is a common pattern in inorganic chemistry problems where a simple fluoride (like A2 = KrF2) is reacted with a Lewis acid (A4). Let's proceed with this more plausible interpretation.\n    *   Reaction: A4 + A2 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio). `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`. This is a classic Lewis acid-base reaction. A4 must be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Let's assume **A4 = AsF5** or **A4 = SbF5**.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = AsF5**. Molar mass = 74.92 (As) + 5 * 19.00 (F) = 74.92 + 95.00 = **169.92 g/mol**.\n    *   The reaction would be: AsF5 + KrF2 → [KrF]+[AsF6]-. So, **A5 = [KrF]+[AsF6]-**.\n    *   The problem states A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. The salt [KrF]+[AsF6]- is known to be unstable in water and decomposes, for example, to Kr, O2, HF, and H3AsO4. This fits the description.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = SbF5**. Molar mass = 121.76 (Sb) + 5 * 19.00 (F) = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n    *   The reaction would be: SbF5 + KrF2 → [KrF]+[SbF6]-. So, **A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-**. This also decomposes in water.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight Range for A4.**\n    *   We have identified two strong candidates for A4: AsF5 and SbF5.\n    *   Molecular weight of AsF5 = 169.92 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF5 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   Let's re-examine the reaction: `By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.` If we take this literally, it means `A4 + Kr -> A5`. This is chemically less plausible than `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`. However, some high-oxidation-state fluorides (like RuF6 or PtF6) can react directly with noble gases. If A4 were such a compound, its molar mass would be much higher (RuF6 ≈ 215 g/mol, PtF6 ≈ 309 g/mol).\n    *   Given the common patterns in such chemistry problems, the interpretation of the reaction being between the simple fluoride (A2) and a Lewis acid (A4) is the most probable one. The wording might be slightly imprecise.\n    *   If we assume A4 is AsF5, its molecular weight is 169.92 g/mol. This falls squarely in the range of 160-180.\n    *   If we assume A4 is SbF5, its molecular weight is 216.76 g/mol. This does not fit any of the provided ranges well.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   The most logical identification for element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n    *   A2 is KrF2.\n    *   The reaction to form A5 is most likely `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`.\n    *   A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride, with AsF5 being the most suitable candidate.\n    *   The molecular weight of AsF5 is approximately 170 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The most direct piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, so its formula can be written as YFₓ.\n    Given: The mass percentage of fluorine (ω(F)) in A2 is 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ω(F) = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))\n    Where Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of element Y.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n    Ar(Y) = (x * Ar(F) * (1 - ω(F))) / ω(F)\n    Ar(Y) = (x * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\n    Ar(Y) = (x * 19.00 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We now test integer values for x to find an element with a matching atomic weight:\n    *   If x = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, but the complex fluoride chemistry described does not fit Calcium).\n    *   If x = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, but its chemistry doesn't fully match all clues).\n    *   If x = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This atomic weight is very close to that of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's verify this by calculating the mass percentage of F in SbF₃:\n        ω(F) in SbF₃ = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%, confirming that **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Other Compounds.**\n    *   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\" and \"can also interact with xenon\". The direct fluorination of antimony (Sb) yields antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. SbF₅ is an extremely potent Lewis acid and is famous for reacting with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂ + SbF₅ → [XeF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻). Therefore, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n    *   **A4**: The problem states we use a \"hot colorless concentrated **solution of A4**\". In the context of aggressive fluorine chemistry, a common solvent is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF). When SbF₅ (our A3) is dissolved in HF, it forms the superacid **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**. A solution of this acid is colorless. This is the most chemically sound candidate for A4, where A4 is the solute that constitutes the active species in the solution.\n    *   **A1 and A5**: The descriptions of A1 (\"bright-red\", decomposes into SbF₃ and F₂) and the reaction to form A5 are complex and contain some inconsistencies with the properties of simple binary antimony fluorides. However, the identities of A2, A3, and A4 are strongly supported by the main chemical facts.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆. We can now calculate its molecular weight using the atomic weights of Hydrogen (H ≈ 1.008), Antimony (Sb ≈ 121.76), and Fluorine (F ≈ 18.998).\n\n    MW(HSbF₆) = Ar(H) + Ar(Sb) + 6 * Ar(F)\n\n    Let's perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Atomic weights from IUPAC\n# H: 1.008 g/mol\n# Sb: 121.760 g/mol\n# F: 18.998 g/mol\n\n# Calculate the molecular weight of fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF6)\nmw_hsbf6 = 1.008 + 121.760 + 6 * 18.998\nprint(mw_hsbf6)\n```\n<execute_result>\n236.756\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (HSbF₆) is 236.756 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    We now compare this value to the given options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The value 236.756 falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 236.756\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nBased on the detailed reasoning and calculations performed:\n\n1.  **Identification of Element Y**: The element Y was identified as Antimony (Sb) by analyzing the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A calculation based on ωF = 31.96% for a compound YFx led to an atomic weight for Y of approximately 121.35 g/mol (assuming x=3), which strongly points to Antimony (Ar = 121.76 g/mol). Therefore, A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identification of Compound A4**: The chemical reactions described in the problem were analyzed. The reaction where elemental Y (Antimony) is added to a solution of A4 to produce A5 (`Sb + A4 → A5`) is a comproportionation reaction. This requires A4 to be an antimony compound in a higher oxidation state than Sb(0). The most common and stable higher-valent fluoride of antimony is Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5), which contains Sb in the +5 oxidation state. Therefore, A4 is identified as SbF5.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Molecular Weight of A4**: The molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) was calculated using the atomic weights of Antimony (Sb ≈ 121.76 g/mol) and Fluorine (F ≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n    Molecular Weight (SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Selection of the Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol needs to be matched with the given ranges:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The value of 216.76 g/mol is closest to the range D) 220-240. Although not strictly within the range, the discrepancy is minor and likely due to rounding in the problem statement's values or ranges. The chemical identification of A4 as SbF5 is strongly supported by all the clues.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    The problem states that compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Using the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) as ~19 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n\n    Solving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine or Selenium)\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃:\n    M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol; M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with the minor difference likely due to rounding in the problem data. Thus, we can confidently identify:\n    *   **Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   **A2 = Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A3**\n    *   A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Antimony).\n    *   A3 can interact with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a well-known strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₄) to form salts like [XeF₃]⁺[SbF₆]⁻. It can also be prepared by the direct reaction of antimony with fluorine.\n    *   Therefore, **A3 = Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A4**\n    *   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Elemental antimony (Y) is added to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. This suggests a comproportionation reaction, where Sb(0) reacts with an antimony compound of a higher oxidation state (present in A4) to form a compound of an intermediate state (A5). A4 must therefore contain antimony in the +5 oxidation state.\n    *   A simple solution of SbF₅ could be considered, but a more prominent chemical entity that fits the description of a \"colorless concentrated solution\" containing Sb(V) is **fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆)**.\n    *   Fluoroantimonic acid is a superacid, typically a mixture of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). The 1:1 mixture forms H[SbF₆] and is a colorless liquid. This is the most logical candidate for A4.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n    Assuming A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆, we can calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(H) = 1.008 g/mol\n    M(Sb) = 121.760 g/mol\n    M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    M(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.760 + 6 * 18.998 = 236.756 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 236.76 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\nAlthough there are some inconsistencies in the description of compound A1 (SbF₅ is colorless, not bright-red, and is stable at 293K), the identification of Y as Sb, A2 as SbF₃, and A4 as HSbF₆ is based on strong, consistent chemical evidence. The molecular weight of HSbF₆ definitively fits into one of the provided ranges.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the substances and determine the molecular weight range of A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. We can test several potential elements (Y) that are known to form multiple fluorides. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n_.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y is Antimony (Sb).**\n    *   If A2 is SbF₃, the molar mass is 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.75 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (3 * 18.998) / 178.75 = 31.88%. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y is Krypton (Kr).**\n    *   If A2 is KrF₂, the molar mass is 83.80 + 2 * 18.998 = 121.80 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (2 * 18.998) / 121.80 = 31.197%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Y is Plutonium (Pu).**\n    *   If A2 is PuF₆, the molar mass is 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.99 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (6 * 18.998) / 357.99 = 31.84%. This is also extremely close.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 4: Y is Platinum (Pt).**\n    *   If A2 is PtF₅, the molar mass is 195.08 + 5 * 18.998 = 290.07 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is about 32.75%, which is not as close as the others.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses with Other Clues**\n\nLet's evaluate these possibilities based on the other information provided.\n\n*   **Clue for A1:** It is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (A1 → A2 + F₂). This means A1 must have a higher oxidation state than A2. A1 also oxidizes xenon.\n\n    *   **If Y is Pu and A2 is PuF₆**: It's impossible for A1 to be a higher binary fluoride of plutonium that decomposes into PuF₆ and F₂. This hypothesis is incorrect.\n    *   **If Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃**: Then A1 must be a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid at room temperature and is stable; it does not decompose into SbF₃ and F₂ at 293 K. This contradicts the properties of A1.\n    *   **If Y is Kr and A2 is KrF₂**: Then A1 would be KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and decompose into KrF₂ and F₂ at room temperature (293 K). KrF₄ is also a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. The only discrepancy is its color; KrF₄ is a white/colorless solid, not bright-red. Given the other strong consistencies, the color description in the problem might be inaccurate.\n\n**3. Corroborating with A3, A4, and A5**\n\nLet's proceed with the most plausible hypothesis: **Y is Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n*   **A1 = KrF₄** (Decomposes to A2, oxidizes Xe)\n*   **A2 = KrF₂** (Product of decomposition, matches mass %)\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of element Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂), it also interacts with xenon (KrF₂ + Xe → XeF₂ + Kr). This perfectly describes **A3 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: A hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 reacts with Y (Krypton) in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5.\n    *   The reaction is Y + A4 → A5. This is a synproportionation reaction, where an element in oxidation state 0 (Kr) reacts with the same element in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n    *   For this to work with Krypton, A4 must be KrF₄ (Kr in +4 state) and A5 must be KrF₂ (Kr in +2 state).\n    *   The reaction is **Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂**. This reaction has a **1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants, perfectly matching the problem description.\n    *   Furthermore, A4 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, so its solution would also be colorless. This fits the description.\n*   **Decomposition of A5**: In water, A5 (KrF₂) decomposes with the formation of two substances. The hydrolysis of KrF₂ produces Krypton gas, Oxygen gas, and aqueous hydrofluoric acid (2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF). It's plausible that \"two substances\" refers to the elemental products, Krypton and Oxygen.\n\n**4. Determining the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the consistent chain of evidence, substance A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Kr = ~83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F = ~18.998 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 * 18.998 = 159.792 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to identify the substance A4 and its molecular weight.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and substance A2**: The problem states that A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF). We can test different formulas for A2 (YFₙ) to find the molar mass of Y (Mᵧ).\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (Mᵧ + n * M(F)).\n    Assuming an atomic mass of 19.00 g/mol for Fluorine (F), we can rearrange the formula to solve for Mᵧ: Mᵧ ≈ (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00), which simplifies to Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    Let's test small integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n=1, Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium).\n    *   If n=2, Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine).\n    *   If n=3, Mᵧ ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    Let's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃). Using precise atomic masses, M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol and M(F) = 19.00 g/mol:\n    ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or **31.88%**. This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    Therefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and substance **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n2.  **Identify substance A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y. The direct fluorination of antimony with excess fluorine yields the highest stable fluoride.\n    `Sb + excess F₂ → SbF₅`\n    Thus, **A3 is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**.\n\n3.  **Identify substances A4 and A5**: The problem describes a reaction where element Y (Sb) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 to obtain A5.\n    `Sb + A4 → A5`\n    This is a comproportionation reaction, where antimony in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with an antimony fluoride (A4) to produce an antimony fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5). The most common reaction of this type for antimony involves the highest oxidation state fluoride, SbF₅, reacting with elemental antimony to produce the more stable lower oxidation state fluoride, SbF₃. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n    `2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃`\n    The problem states that Y and A4 are added in a 1:1 molar ratio. This does not mean it's the stoichiometric ratio of the reaction. It means that if we mix, for example, 3 moles of Sb with 3 moles of SbF₅, the reaction will proceed, and A5 will be obtained. In this case, all 3 moles of SbF₅ would react with 2 moles of Sb, leaving 1 mole of Sb unreacted, and successfully producing 5 moles of SbF₃. This interpretation fits the chemical facts.\n    Therefore:\n    *   The reactant in solution, **A4, is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**. SbF₅ is a colorless liquid, consistent with the description.\n    *   The product obtained, **A5, is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n4.  **Final Checks**:\n    *   The problem states A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF₃ hydrolyzes in water, forming antimony compounds (like Sb₂O₃ or SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), so this condition is met.\n    *   The remaining clues state A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and oxidizes xenon. While the common antimony fluorides are colorless, the existence of an exotic or unstable red fluoride (A1) does not contradict the identification of A2, A3, A4, and A5, which are based on solid quantitative and reaction data.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of substance A4. We have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of SbF₅ = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n    *   MW(SbF₅) ≈ 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    Now we check the given ranges:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 160-180 (This range contains the MW of SbF₃, 178.76 g/mol)\n    *   D) 140-160\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall strictly within any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range B (220-240), being just ~1.5% below the lower boundary. Given the high confidence in the chemical identification of A4 as SbF₅ based on the reaction data, it is most likely that option B is the intended answer, allowing for a slight inaccuracy in the provided ranges.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "This is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. A successful solution requires identifying the most reliable information and following that logical path. The most robust clues are quantitative (the mass percentage and molecular weight ranges) and the specific stoichiometry of a core reaction.\n\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Unknown Element Y**\n\nThe most critical quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (general formula YFₙ), has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%.\n\nWe can derive the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) from this:\n*   ωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Given M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and ωF = 0.3196, we can rearrange the formula to:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe now test small integer values for 'n' (the oxidation state) to find a plausible element Y:\n*   **n=1**: M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (e.g., Ca)\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Kr)\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is extremely close to **Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol)** and reasonably close to **Iodine (I, 126.9 g/mol)**.\n*   **n=4**: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy)\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu)\n\nCalculating the theoretical mass percentage for the best candidates reveals that Antimony (SbF₃, 31.88%), Dysprosium (DyF₄, 31.86%), and Plutonium (PuF₆, 31.84%) provide almost perfect numerical fits. Iodine (IF₃, 31.0%) is also a reasonable fit.\n\n**Step 2: Use Reaction Stoichiometry to Identify the Compounds**\n\nMany clues about color and stability are qualitative and can be misleading in such problems. However, the reaction stoichiometry is a powerful quantitative clue.\n\n*   The reaction is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... a solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n*   This describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5` where the reactants Y and A4 are in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a comproportionation reaction.\n*   Let's test our most promising candidate elements against this 1:1 stoichiometry:\n    *   For Antimony (Sb), the relevant reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\n    *   For Dysprosium (Dy), the relevant reaction is `Dy + 3DyF₄ → 4DyF₃`. The ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\n    *   For **Iodine (I)**, the comproportionation reaction between iodine and iodine pentafluoride is: `I + IF₅ → 2IF₃`. This reaction proceeds with a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio** between the reactants.\n\nThis excellent fit for the reaction stoichiometry strongly suggests that **Y is Iodine (I)**.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the Identities of the Iodine Fluorides**\n\nIf we accept Y = Iodine, the identities of the substances fall into place:\n*   **Y**: Iodine (I)\n*   **A4**: The reactant in the 1:1 reaction, which is **Iodine Pentafluoride (IF₅)**.\n*   **A5**: The product of the reaction, which is **Iodine Trifluoride (IF₃)**.\n*   **A2**: The substance with ωF ≈ 31.96%. Since A5 is IF₃, it is logical that A2 is also **IF₃**. The calculated mass percentage for IF₃ (31.0%) is reasonably close to the value given in the problem.\n*   **A1**: This substance decomposes into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher fluoride, likely IF₅ or IF₇. Identifying A1 as IF₅ (`IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂`) creates an identity clash with A4. Alternatively, if A1 is IF₇, the decomposition `IF₇ → IF₃ + 2F₂` is also plausible. In either case, the core identification of A4 remains sound.\n*   **A3**: This substance \"interacts with xenon.\" Higher iodine fluorides like IF₇ are known to react with xenon, confirming the chemical plausibility.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the consistent chemical logic, A4 is **Iodine Pentafluoride (IF₅)**.\n\n*   Atomic Mass of Iodine (I) ≈ 126.90 g/mol\n*   Atomic Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (IF₅) = 126.90 + 5 × 19.00 = 126.90 + 95.00 = **221.90 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 221.90 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\n**C) 220-240**\nD) 160-180\n\nThe final answer is therefore C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

These don't form five binary fluorides.\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr). Let's check Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol).\n        If Y=Kr and n=2, A2 would be KrF2.\n        Let's calculate the precise ɷF for KrF2: M(KrF2) = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (38 / 121.8) * 100% = 31.20%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Let's check Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol).\n        If Y=Sb and n=3, A2 would be SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (57 / 178.76) * 100% = 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu). If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. ɷF = 31.84%. Also a very close match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n\n    *   **Clue about A4:** \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This implies A4 itself is colorless or forms a colorless solution.\n        *   Antimony fluorides: SbF3 and SbF5 are colorless. This fits.\n        *   Plutonium fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF6 are all colored. This does not fit.\n        *   Krypton fluorides: KrF2 is a colorless solid. This fits.\n\n    *   **Clue about A1:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine.\"\n        *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. The decomposition A1 -> SbF3 + F2 implies A1=SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and is thermally stable, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   If Y=Kr, A2=KrF2. The decomposition A1 -> KrF2 + F2 implies A1=KrF4. KrF4 is a theoretically predicted but highly unstable compound. Its properties are unknown, but it's plausible for a problem to assign it a color (bright-red) and have it decompose at room temperature. This fits the chemical logic well.\n\n    *   **Clues about oxidizing Xenon:** \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\".\n        *   If Y=Kr, A1=KrF4 and A3 could be KrF2. Both are extremely strong oxidizing agents and are known (or expected) to react with Xenon. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Clue about the reaction to form A5:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... a solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n        *   If Y=Kr, A4 is a colorless fluoride, so A4=KrF2. The reaction is Kr + KrF2 -> A5. A plausible 1:1 reaction is the formation of two moles of the radical, KrF. So, A5 = KrF. The radical KrF would readily decompose in water, which fits the final clue.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the identity of Y and the compounds.**\n    The Krypton (Kr) hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent story, despite the slight discrepancy in the mass percentage (31.2% vs 31.96%), which can be attributed to an error in the problem statement. The Antimony (Sb) case, while matching the mass percentage better, fails on several key chemical properties of the compounds.\n\n    Therefore, we can identify the substances as:\n    *   Y = Kr (Krypton)\n    *   A1 = KrF4 (hypothetical bright-red, unstable compound)\n    *   A2 = KrF2 (decomposition product)\n    *   A3 = KrF2 (reacts with Xe)\n    *   A4 = KrF2 (colorless, used in the final reaction)\n    *   A5 = KrF (product of Kr + KrF2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, A4 is KrF2.\n    Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(KrF2) = M(Kr) + 2 * M(F)\n    MW(A4) = 83.80 g/mol + 2 * 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 38.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 121.80 g/mol. This value falls within the range given in option B.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 160-180\n\nThe correct range is 110-130.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical properties described, the element Y is identified as Platinum (Pt). Here is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Element Y and its Fluorides**: The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. Platinum is known to form five such compounds: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆.\n\n2.  **Substance A1**: A1 is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red, volatile solid known to be one of the most powerful oxidizing agents. It is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon, a noble gas. It is also thermally unstable. Therefore, A1 is PtF₆.\n\n3.  **Substance A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition of platinum hexafluoride can yield lower fluorides. A plausible decomposition is PtF₆ → PtF₄ + F₂. This would make A2 = PtF₄. Another possibility is the decomposition to PtF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n    *   For PtF₄, the calculated ωF is approximately 28.03%.\n    *   For PtF₅, the calculated ωF is approximately 32.75%.\n    The value for PtF₅ is closer to the one given in the problem, suggesting a likely typo in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry problems. Assuming the chemical properties are the primary identifiers, we proceed with the platinum hypothesis. Let's tentatively identify A2 as PtF₄, based on the simple decomposition reaction.\n\n4.  **Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Platinum) and can also interact with xenon. Fluorination of platinum can produce PtF₄ or PtF₆. Since A1 is PtF₆ and A2 is PtF₄, and the five compounds are distinct, this step presents a challenge if A1-A5 must all be different. However, if we re-examine the decomposition of A1, PtF₆ can decompose to PtF₅. Let's refine the assignments:\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆** (Red, oxidizes Xe, decomposes)\n    *   **A2 = PtF₅** (Decomposition product, ωF ≈ 32.75%, close to 31.96%)\n    *   **A3 = PtF₄** (Product of fluorinating Pt, different from A1 and A2. As a strong fluorinating agent, interaction with xenon is plausible).\n\n5.  **Substances A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding element Y (Pt) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction: Pt⁰ + PtFₙ → PtFₘ. The remaining known fluorides are PtF₂ and the lesser-known PtF. The only reaction that fits a 1:1 molar ratio is:\n    Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF\n    This means **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n\n6.  **Decomposition of A5**: The final clue states that A5 (PtF) decomposes in water. As a sub-halide, this is chemically very likely, probably through disproportionation.\n\n7.  **Molecular Weight of A4**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. Based on the deduction, A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n    *   The atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) is approximately 195.08 g/mol.\n    *   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of PtF₂ = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls into the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:** The problem states that compound A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can use this information to determine the identity of element Y. The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine in a binary compound YF_n is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    where M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. By rearranging the formula and testing integer values for n, we can find a plausible atomic mass for Y and identify the element.\n\n2.  **Identify Other Compounds (A1, A3):**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F2). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of Y than A2.\n    *   A1 and A3 both oxidize xenon, indicating they are very strong oxidizing agents. This typically corresponds to the highest known fluoride of an element.\n    *   Based on the identity of Y, we can deduce the formulas for A1 and A3.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   The core chemical reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y to A4. A4 and A5 are also binary fluorides of Y.\n    *   We will consider the possible fluorides of Y for A4.\n    *   We will analyze the 1:1 reaction to determine which candidate for A4 is chemically plausible.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:** Once A4 is identified, we will calculate its molecular weight.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:** We will compare the calculated molecular weight of A4 with the given options to find the correct range.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry problem by identifying the unknown element and its compounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2\n    omega_F = 0.3196  # Mass fraction of Fluorine in A2\n    M_F = 19.00      # Atomic mass of Fluorine\n\n    # Dictionary of relevant elements and their atomic masses\n    elements = {\n        'Sb': 121.76, 'I': 126.90, 'Pt': 195.08, \n        'Dy': 162.50, 'Br': 79.90, 'Bi': 208.98\n    }\n\n    best_fit = {'element': None, 'n': 0, 'error': float('inf'), 'formula': ''}\n\n    # Loop through possible numbers of F atoms (n) to find the best fit for Y\n    for n in range(1, 7):\n        # M_Y = (n * M_F / omega_F) - n * M_F\n        M_Y_calculated = n * M_F * (1/omega_F - 1)\n        for symbol, mass in elements.items():\n            error = abs(M_Y_calculated - mass) / mass\n            if error < best_fit['error']:\n                best_fit.update({\n                    'element': symbol, \n                    'n': n, \n                    'error': error, \n                    'formula': f\"{symbol}F{n}\"\n                })\n\n    Y_element_symbol = best_fit['element']\n    Y_element_mass = elements[Y_element_symbol]\n    A2_formula = best_fit['formula']\n    A2_n = best_fit['n']\n\n    # Verification of the mass fraction for the best fit (SbF3)\n    # M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76\n    # omega_F_check = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%\n    # This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming Y=Sb and A2=SbF3.\n    \n    # Step 2 & 3: Identify A4\n    # Y = Antimony (Sb), A2 = SbF3.\n    # A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF3) and F2, so A1 must be a higher fluoride, SbF5.\n    # A3 oxidizes Xe, so it must be the strongest fluorinating agent, SbF5.\n    # The remaining compounds are A4 and A5.

This molecular weight falls into the range 160-180.\n\nFinal Answer Choice:\nThe molecular weight of A4 is 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range of option A.\nA) 160-180\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 110-130\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19.0 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\nM(Y) = n × 19.0 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) = n × 19.0 × (3.1289 - 1)\nM(Y) = n × 19.0 × 2.1289\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Sc). Not known for five fluorides.\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br). Bromine fluorides (BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅) do not have ɷF near 31.96%.\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb, M = 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's verify the ɷF for SbF₃ and PuF₆:\n*   For SbF₃: M = 121.76 + 3×19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. ɷF = (3×19.00)/178.76 = 57/178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is an excellent match for 31.96%.\n*   For PuF₆: M = 244 + 6×19.00 = 358 g/mol. ɷF = (6×19.00)/358 = 114/358 = 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is also an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Candidates for Y (Sb vs. Pu)**\n\nLet's use the other clues to decide between Sb and Pu.\nThe problem states: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine.\" This means A1 is a higher fluoride than A2 (A1 -> A2 + F₂).\n\n*   If Y = Pu, then A2 = PuF₆. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF₇ or PuF₈), which are not known to exist. This makes the Pu hypothesis unlikely.\n*   If Y = Sb, then A2 = SbF₃. A1 would be a higher fluoride. The most common higher fluoride is SbF₅. The decomposition would be SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂.\n\nLet's proceed with the Antimony (Sb) hypothesis, as it is more plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, A5**\n\n*   **Y = Sb** (Antimony)\n*   **A2 = SbF₃** (from mass percentage).\n*   **A1**: Decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This implies A1 is SbF₅. However, the problem describes A1 as \"bright-red\" and unstable at 293 K (20 °C). SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid. This is a significant inconsistency in the problem statement, but SbF₅ is the only logical candidate for A1 based on the decomposition products.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb + F₂ -> A3) and interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ or SbF₅. SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, known to react with xenon fluorides. So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: These are involved in the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y to A4. The reaction occurs in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n    *   The reaction is Sb + A4 -> A5. Since Sb metal (oxidation state 0) is a reactant, it will act as a reducing agent. Therefore, A4 must be an oxidizing agent, meaning it's a fluoride of antimony with a positive oxidation state (SbF₃ or SbF₅).\n    *   A reaction between Sb and SbF₃ is not expected, as Sb(0) cannot reduce Sb(III).\n    *   Therefore, A4 must be the higher fluoride, **A4 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The reaction is a comproportionation: Sb(0) + Sb(V) -> Sb(III). The product A5 would be **A5 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Let's check the stoichiometry: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃. The molar ratio is 2:3, not 1:1 as stated in the problem. This is another inconsistency. However, given the other evidence, it's the most chemically sound reaction pathway.\n    *   Let's check the remaining clues: A4 (SbF₅) is a colorless liquid, so a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" is perfectly descriptive. A5 (SbF₃) hydrolyzes in water to form antimony(III) oxide and hydrofluoric acid (SbF₃ + H₂O -> Sb₂O₃ + HF), which are two substances.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the analysis, A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Let's calculate its molecular weight.\nM(A4) = M(SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F)\nM(A4) ≈ 121.76 g/mol + 5 × 19.00 g/mol\nM(A4) ≈ 121.76 + 95.00\nM(A4) ≈ 216.76 g/mol\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 216.76 g/mol. We need to find the range that contains this value.\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 216.76 g/mol is not strictly within any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range C [220-240]. The discrepancy of ~3 g/mol is likely due to flaws in the problem statement (which we have already noted regarding the properties of A1 and the 1:1 molar ratio). Among the given choices, C is by far the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most logical identification for A4 is SbF₅, with a molecular weight of approximately 217 g/mol, which falls closest to the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with the general formula YFₙ.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule (and the oxidation state of Y).\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe need to find an integer 'n' that results in the molar mass of a real element (Y) known to form at least five binary fluorides. We can test plausible values for 'n'.\n\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, K - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se - incorrect chemistry for 5 fluorides)\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb - only 2 fluorides)\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, Tl - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Pu, Am - plausible)\n\nLet's test Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol). If n=6, our estimate for M(Y) is 242.7 g/mol, which is very close to 244 g/mol.\nLet's calculate the precise ɷF for PuF₆:\nɷF(PuF₆) = (6 * 19.00) / (244 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%.\nThis value is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy is acceptable in such problems.\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that **Element Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is PuF₆**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Five Plutonium Fluorides (A1 to A5)**\n\nThe problem states there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Plutonium). Let's use the provided clues to identify them.\n\n*   **A2 = PuF₆**: As determined above. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid.\n*   **A1**: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (PuF₆) and fluorine.\" This means A1 is a higher fluoride of plutonium that is thermally unstable. This points to **A1 = PuF₈**. While extremely unstable and not a common compound, its existence as a transient species that decomposes to PuF₆ and F₂ fits the description perfectly. The \"bright-red\" color is also plausible for a high-oxidation-state compound.\n*   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" The direct fluorination of plutonium metal (Y) typically yields **A3 = PuF₄**. PuF₄ is a strong enough fluorinating agent to react with xenon under certain conditions (e.g., to form XeF₂).\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction where plutonium metal reduces a higher-oxidation-state plutonium fluoride. A common reaction in plutonium chemistry is the reduction of Pu(IV) by Pu(0) to form Pu(III).\n    *   Let's assume A4 is a Pu(IV) compound. The most common water-soluble Pu(IV) species is formed from PuF₄, but the solution itself would be colored. The problem states the solution of A4 is \"colorless\". This is a key hint. While most actinide ions are colored, the perplutonyl ion, [PuO₂]²⁺, where Pu is in the +6 oxidation state, is known to form nearly colorless solutions in some acids. This ion can be formed by dissolving PuF₆ (A2) in water with an oxidizing agent, or perhaps another fluoride exists that forms this ion. Let's assume A4 is a compound that provides Pu(VI) in solution. The simplest binary fluoride that could do this is PuF₆ itself. However, the problem distinguishes between A2 and A4. A more likely candidate for A4 is **plutonyl fluoride, PuO₂F₂**. This is not a *binary* compound of Y and F, which contradicts the initial statement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Perhaps the \"five binary compounds\" are the known PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆, and the unstable PuF₈.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nPu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 is PuF₄, then Pu + PuF₄ -> 2PuF₂ (not a known stable fluoride) or Pu + 3PuF₄ -> 4PuF₃. The ratio is not 1:1.\nIf A4 is PuF₆, then 2Pu + PuF₆ -> 3PuF₂ (not stable) or Pu + 2PuF₆ -> 3PuF₄. The ratio is not 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a slight inconsistency in the problem statement, possibly regarding the \"binary\" nature of all compounds or the reaction stoichiometry. However, let's focus on the most chemically sound interpretation. The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` is a comproportionation. A very common one is:\nPu(IV) + Pu(0) -> Pu(III)\n3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃ (ratio is 3:1, not 1:1)\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that the problem refers to a different element. However, the mass calculation for Pu is extremely compelling. Let's stick with Pu and assume there might be a slight inaccuracy in the problem's description of the reaction.\n\nThe most plausible set of well-known fluorides are PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆.\n*   A2 = PuF₆\n*   A1 = PuF₈ (hypothetical but fits decomposition)\n*   A3 = PuF₄ (product of direct fluorination)\n\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be assigned from the remaining fluorides, likely involving PuF₃.\nThe reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1) in solution is the main puzzle. If we assume the species in solution are ions, the reaction could be:\n2Pu³⁺ + Pu⁰ -> 3Pu²⁺ (Pu(II) is not stable in solution)\nPu⁴⁺ + Pu⁰ -> 2Pu²⁺ (not stable)\n\nLet's ignore the problematic 1:1 ratio for a moment and focus on what A4 could be. It's a fluoride of Y=Pu, and it's used in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Given that A1, A2, and A3 are already assigned to PuF₈, PuF₆, and PuF₄, the most likely candidate for A4 is **PuF₄**. While Pu(IV) solutions are typically colored, conditions might exist (complexation, high concentration in specific acids) where it's described as \"colorless\", or this could be an idealization in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nAssuming the most plausible identification based on the available information:\n*   Element Y = Plutonium (Pu)\n*   Compound A4 = Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF₄)\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of PuF₄.\n*   Molar mass of Pu ≈ 244 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of F ≈ 19 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of PuF₄ = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nMW(PuF₄) = 244 + 4 * 19\nMW(PuF₄) = 244 + 76\nMW(PuF₄) = 320 g/mol\n\nThis calculated molecular weight does not fall into any of the provided ranges. Let's re-read the problem carefully.\n\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nLet's reconsider the element. What if the element is Uranium (U, M=238)?\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n238 ≈ 40.45 * n => n = 5.88 ≈ 6.\nLet's check ɷF for UF₆:\nɷF(UF₆) = (6 * 19) / (238 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 352 ≈ 0.3239 or 32.39%.\nThis is also close to 31.96%. Uranium is famous for its fluorides (UF₃, UF₄, UF₅, UF₆).\nLet's assume Y = U.\n*   A2 = UF₆ (ɷF = 32.4%)\n*   A1 = A higher fluoride that decomposes to UF₆. (e.g., an unstable adduct)\n*   A3 = UF₆ (product of direct fluorination of U is UF₆)\n*   A4/A5 reaction: U + A4 -> A5.\n    A known reaction is U + 3UF₄ -> 4UF₃. (Not 1:1)\n    Another is U + UF₆ -> intermediate fluorides like UF₅.\n\nLet's calculate the MW of possible uranium fluorides:\n*   UF₃: 238 + 3*19 = 295\n*   UF₄: 238 + 4*19 = 314\n*   UF₅: 238 + 5*19 = 333\n*   UF₆: 238 + 6*19 = 352\n\nNone of these fit the ranges well. The initial mass calculation pointed more strongly to Pu. Let's go back to Pu and reconsider the compounds.\n\nWhat if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride? The problem says \"five binary compounds... are known\", but A4 might be something else used in the synthesis of A5. However, the question asks for the molecular weight of A4, implying it's a specific substance.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass calculation.\nM(Y) = 40.445 * n.\nLet's check n=4. M(Y) = 40.445 * 4 = 161.78. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, M=162.5).\nLet's check ɷF for DyF₄:\nɷF(DyF₄) = (4 * 19) / (162.5 + 76) = 76 / 238.5 = 0.3186. This is an excellent match to 31.96%.\nHowever, Dy is a lanthanide and its stable oxidation state is +3. DyF₄ is extremely unstable and not a common reagent. It is unlikely to be involved in this complex set of reactions.\n\nLet's try n=3. M(Y) = 40.445 * 3 = 121.335. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76).\nLet's check ɷF for SbF₃:\nɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188. This is also an excellent match.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y = Sb.\n*   Five binary fluorides? No, only SbF₃ and SbF₅ are common. This contradicts the premise.\n\nThe most plausible candidate remains Pu, despite the inconsistencies. Let's assume there is an error in the question's details (like the 1:1 ratio or the \"colorless\" solution) and proceed with the most likely identities.\nY = Pu.\nA2 = PuF₆.\nA4 = PuF₄. MW = 320 g/mol. This is not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from the answers.\nA) 110-130: e.g., KrF₂ (122), Xe (131)\nB) 140-160: e.g., BrF₅ (175), IF₃ (184) - no, IF (146), TeF₄ (204)\nC) 160-180: e.g., SbF₃ (179), BrF₅ (175)\nD) 220-240: e.g., DyF₄ (238.5), AtF₃ (267)\n\nIf A4 is SbF₃, MW = 179, which is in range C. But Sb does not have 5 fluorides.\nIf A4 is BrF₅, MW = 175, which is in range C. Let's test Y=Br.\nA2 has ɷF = 31.96%. Let's check Br fluorides.\nBrF: ɷF = 19 / 98.9 = 19.2%\nBrF₃: ɷF = 57 / 136.9 = 41.6%\nThe mass fraction doesn't match.\n\nThere must be a specific element and set of compounds intended by the problem setter. Let's reconsider the mass calculation as the most solid piece of evidence.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nThe best fits were Pu (n=6), Dy (n=4), Sb (n=3).\nOf these, only Pu has a rich fluoride chemistry approaching 5 compounds. The inconsistencies in the text (1:1 ratio, color) are likely red herrings or errors. The core identification must come from the mass fraction.\n\nLet's assume Y=Pu. The known fluorides are PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆. Let's call the unstable one PuF₈.\nA1=PuF₈, A2=PuF₆, A3=PuF₄.\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be PuF₃ and PuF₅.\nReaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4=PuF₅, Pu + PuF₅ -> ? No simple product.\nIf A4=PuF₃, this reaction doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. This is a reduction of A4. So A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5.\nLet's assume A4 = PuF₄ (Pu⁴⁺) and A5 = PuF₃ (Pu³⁺).\nThe reaction is 3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃. The problem states a 1:1 ratio, which is a mismatch. But if we ignore the stoichiometry and accept the identities, then A4 = PuF₄. MW(PuF₄) = 320. Still not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial calculation. What if the element is Krypton?\nY = Kr, M=83.8.\nA2 = KrF₂. ɷF = (2*19)/(83.8+38) = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y = Kr.\n*   Five binary compounds? No, only KrF₂ is well-established. KrF₄ is disputed. This premise fails.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This would make A1 = KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and can decompose to KrF₂ + F₂.\n*   A1 (KrF₄) oxidizes Xenon. Yes, KrF₄ would be a powerful oxidizer.\n*   A3 (also a Kr fluoride) interacts with Xenon.\n*   A4? A5? Reaction Kr + A4 -> A5? This chemistry is not established.\n\nThis path seems unlikely due to the \"five compounds\" rule. The problem seems to be constructed around a specific, perhaps obscure, chemical system, or it contains significant errors.\n\nLet's revisit the SbF₃ possibility. MW=179, fits range C.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF₃. ɷF=31.88% (excellent fit).\nLet's try to make the rest of the story work, ignoring the \"five fluorides\" rule.\n*   A2 = SbF₃.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This means A1 = SbF₅. SbF₅ is a liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" and it doesn't decompose to SbF₃ + F₂ at 293K. It's quite stable. This path fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the molecular weight of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.\nIf the answer is C (160-180), then A4 could be SbF₃ (179) or BrF₅ (175). We've shown that the chemistry for Y=Sb and Y=Br doesn't fit the description of A1/A2.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the mass fraction for A2.\nIf Y=Br, and A4=BrF₅ (MW=175, range C), what could A2 be?\nA2 = BrF₃? ɷF=41.6%. Too far from 31.96%.\nA2 = BrF? ɷF=19.2%. Too far.\n\nThis problem is highly ambiguous or contains errors. However, a choice must be made. The calculation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n is the most quantitative clue. The fits for Sb (n=3) and Dy (n=4) are mathematically excellent.\n*   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. Then A4 could be SbF₅. MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5*19 = 216.76. This is not in the ranges.\n*   If Y=Dy, A2=DyF₄. Then A4 could be DyF₃. MW(DyF₃) = 162.5 + 3*19 = 219.5. This is close to range D.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio).\nDy + A4 -> A5. If A4 is a higher fluoride, this is a reduction. But Dy's most stable state is +3. A reduction of Dy(IV) to Dy(III) is plausible.\nLet A4 = DyF₄. Let A5 = DyF₃.\nReaction: Dy + 3DyF₄ -> 4DyF₃. The ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, let's reconsider the most famous series of fluorides: Iodine.\nY=I. M=126.9.\nM(Y) = 40.45 * n => 126.9 = 40.45 * n => n=3.13.\nA2 could be IF₃. ɷF(IF₃) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 31.0%. This is a decent fit.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y=I.\n*   Five binary compounds? Yes: IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇ are known.\n*   A2 = IF₃.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (IF₃) and F₂. So A1 = IF₅. IF₅ is a colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\". It doesn't decompose this way at 293K. This path fails.\n\nLet's go back to the best numerical fit that isn't a lanthanide: Antimony (Sb).\nY=Sb, A2=SbF₃, ɷF=31.88%.\nLet's assume the problem creator took liberties with the chemical properties.\nA2 = SbF₃.\nA1 = SbF₅. (Let's ignore that it's stable and not red).\nA3 = SbF₅ (product of fluorination of Sb).\nReaction: Sb + A4 -> A5.\nA4 must be SbF₅. A5 must be SbF₃.\nReaction: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃. The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF₅, its MW is 216.8 g/mol. Not in the options.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF₃, its MW is 178.8 g/mol. This is in range C (160-180).\nBut if A4=SbF₃, the reaction Sb + SbF₃ -> A5 makes no sense.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. It's in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could mean the solvent is part of the reaction. For example, in HF.\nSbF₅ in HF is a superacid, H₂F⁺[SbF₆]⁻.\nLet's assume the system is Antimony. A4 has a MW in one of the ranges. The only plausible candidate is SbF₃ with MW=179. Let's select this and acknowledge the inconsistencies. If A4 is SbF₃, its molecular weight is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Identify Y and A2: The calculation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n points strongly to Sb (n=3) or Dy (n=4).\n2.  Test Y=Sb: A2=SbF₃. ɷF is a near-perfect match.\n3.  Identify A4: The other stable fluoride is SbF₅. MW=217. Not in options. The only Sb fluoride whose MW is in an option range is SbF₃ (MW=179, range C).\n4.  Conclusion: Despite the narrative part of the problem being inconsistent with the chemistry of antimony (number of fluorides, properties of A1, reaction stoichiometry), the numerical data (mass fraction) points strongly to A2=SbF₃. If we are forced to choose one of the fluorides of Sb as A4, and its MW must fit an option, the only possibility is A4=SbF₃. This creates a contradiction where A2=A4, but it's the only path that aligns the numerical data with the multiple-choice options.\n\nTherefore, based on the molecular weight calculation, A4 is likely SbF₃.\nMW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.75 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires careful deduction from the given clues. Several apparent contradictions in the problem statement (regarding colors, stability, and the number of compounds) are characteristic of advanced chemistry problems, designed to test understanding of chemical principles over rote memorization. The most consistent solution identifies the element Y as Krypton.\n\nHere is the step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2**: The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. The formula for a binary fluoride is YF_n. The molar mass of Y can be calculated using the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.0) / (M(Y) + n * 19.0)\n    This rearranges to M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\n    Testing plausible integer values for n (the oxidation state):\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Krypton (Kr), which is 83.8 g/mol.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is a close match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This matches well with Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol) and Neptunium (Np, 237 g/mol).\n\n    While other elements provide good matches, they lead to significant chemical contradictions later on. The Krypton hypothesis, despite some inconsistencies in the problem's descriptive data, provides the most coherent pathway. Let's proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds**:\n    *   **A2**: With Y=Kr and n=2, A2 is **KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride). The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content. The next known fluoride of krypton is **KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride). The decomposition reaction is KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂. The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance,\" which is a known inaccuracy in this classic problem; KrF₄ is a colorless (or white) solid. A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent and is known to oxidize xenon.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Krypton) and also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of krypton typically produces KrF₂. KrF₂ is a strong oxidizing agent that reacts with xenon. Therefore, A3 is also **KrF₂**.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: These are identified through the reaction: \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants are in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** fits this description perfectly (1 mole of Kr reacts with 1 mole of KrF₄).\n        *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **Final check on A5**: The last clue states that A5 decomposes in water. A5 is identified as KrF₂, which readily hydrolyzes in water.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    *   Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   The molecular weight is calculated as: M(Kr) + 4 * M(F).\n    *   Using the atomic weights, M(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Range**:\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   This value falls within the range of 140-160.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from A2:**\n    *   A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)), where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y): M(Y) = (n * M(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF.\n    *   Plugging in the values: M(Y) = (n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   We test plausible integer values for 'n' (oxidation state):\n        *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF is not the common fluoride).\n        *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but also very close to Krypton, M(Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check KrF₂. The fluorine percentage in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close.\n        *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony).\n        *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol.\n        *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n        *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of A1:**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance. While many fluorides are colorless, some, like dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂) and chromyl fluoride (CrO₂F₂), are reddish.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (F₂). This indicates A1 is unstable at room temperature and has a higher fluorine content than A2. The reaction is: A1 → A2 + F₂.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. This points to A1 being an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent, more so than xenon difluoride. Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is known to oxidize xenon to xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    *   The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon strongly suggests that element Y might be Krypton (Kr). Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) is one of the most powerful known fluorinating agents.\n    *   If Y is Krypton, then A2 would be KrF₂. However, the mass percentage calculation (31.2%) is not a perfect match for the given 31.96%. Let's re-examine the decomposition.\n    *   The decomposition is A1 → A2 + F₂. If A2 is KrF₂, then A1 must be KrF₄.\n    *   Let's check the properties of KrF₄. It is a white crystalline solid that is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature. This fits the description of A1's instability. The decomposition reaction would be KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂.\n    *   Now, let's re-evaluate A2. The problem states A2 has ɷF=31.96%. If A1 is KrF₄, then A2 is KrF₂. The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%. The discrepancy might be due to experimental data variations in the problem statement, but Krypton fits the chemical properties described far better than any other element.\n    *   Let's assume Y is Krypton.\n        *   **A1**: KrF₄ (Krypton tetrafluoride). Although described as a white solid, its extreme reactivity and instability could align with the problem's description. It decomposes into KrF₂ and F₂.\n        *   **A2**: KrF₂ (Krypton difluoride). It is a powerful oxidizing agent. Its molar mass is approximately 121.8 g/mol.\n    *   **A3**: The problem states A3 can also interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorination of Y. This is consistent with KrF₂, which is made from Kr and F₂ and reacts with xenon. So, A3 is also KrF₂.\n    *   The problem mentions \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" For Krypton, while KrF₂ is well-established, KrF₄ is theoretically predicted and its synthesis has been claimed but not definitively confirmed. Other compounds like KrF and KrF₆ are hypothetical or only exist under extreme conditions. The \"five compounds\" might refer to KrF₂, KrF₄, and cationic/complex species like KrF⁺, Kr₂F₃⁺, and [KrF⁺][SbF₆⁻]. This part of the prompt is slightly ambiguous but doesn't prevent solving the core problem.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y (Krypton) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n    *   This points towards a clathrate compound. Clathrates are substances where one type of molecule is trapped within the crystal lattice of another. Krypton is known to form clathrates with water and other molecules like hydroquinone and phenol.\n    *   Let's assume A4 is a substance that can form a clathrate with Krypton. Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂) is a classic example.\n    *   **A4**: Hydroquinone (C₆H₄(OH)₂). It is a colorless solid and forms solutions.\n    *   **A5**: Krypton-hydroquinone clathrate. The general formula is [C₆H₄(OH)₂]₃·Kr. This is formed by adding Krypton to a solution of hydroquinone.\n    *   When this clathrate (A5) is placed in water, it decomposes back into its constituent parts: Krypton gas and a solution of hydroquinone. These are the \"two substances.\"\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   A4 has been identified as hydroquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₄(OH)₂.\n    *   Molar Mass Calculation:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 * 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 6 * 1.01 g/mol = 6.06 g/mol\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n        *   Total Molar Mass = 72.06 + 6.06 + 32.00 = **110.12 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (110.12 g/mol) falls within the range of 110-130.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula of a binary fluoride can be represented as YFₙ or YₘFₙ. Let's test the simple case first: A2 = YFₙ.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 (Ca, Ar). Not suitable.\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 (Br, Se). Does not form 5 fluorides with the required properties.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 (Sb). Antimony's mass is 121.76. This is a good match. However, Sb only forms two well-known fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) and the reaction chemistry described does not fit well.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 (Pu, Am). Plutonium (M=244) is a good candidate. However, this leads to a molecular weight for A4 that does not match any of the options.\n\n    Let's test the case where A2 = Y₂Fₙ.\n    ɷF = (n × 19) / (2 × M(Y) + n × 19) = 0.3196\n    19n = 0.3196 × (2 × M(Y) + 19n)\n    19n = 0.6392 × M(Y) + 6.0724n\n    12.9276n = 0.6392 × M(Y)\n    M(Y) ≈ 20.22n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 20.22 × 5 = 101.1 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Ruthenium (Ru)**, which has a molar mass of 101.07 g/mol.\n    *   Let's check: If Y=Ru, and A2 = Ru₂F₅, the mass fraction of fluorine is (5 × 19) / (2 × 101.07 + 5 × 19) = 95 / (202.14 + 95) = 95 / 297.14 ≈ 0.3197 or 31.97%. This is a nearly perfect match for the given 31.96%.\n\n2.  **Verify the other clues with Y = Ruthenium (Ru).**\n    *   **Five binary compounds:** Ruthenium is known to form RuF₃, RuF₄, RuF₅, RuF₆, and the mixed-valence compound Ru₂F₅. This fits the clue.\n    *   **A1 decomposition:** A1 decomposes into A2 (Ru₂F₅) and fluorine. This means A1 must have a higher fluorine content than A2. A plausible candidate for A1 is RuF₆, which is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K). The reaction could be 4RuF₆ → 2Ru₂F₅ + 7F₂.\n    *   **A1 properties:** A1 is \"bright-red\" and oxidizes xenon. RuF₆ is a very strong oxidizing agent and is one of the few substances that can oxidize xenon. Its color is described as dark-brown, which is a discrepancy, but chemical problem color descriptions can be imprecise.\n    *   **A3 properties:** A3 also interacts with xenon and is made by fluorinating Ru. This could be RuF₅ or RuF₆, both of which are strong oxidizing agents.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5.**\n    *   The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y (Ru) and A4.\n    *   This is a synproportionation reaction. Let A4 = RuFₙ. The general form of the reaction for a 1:1 ratio is Ru + RuFₙ → 2RuFₘ, which requires n=2m for the stoichiometry to balance.\n    *   Let's test possible candidates for A4 from the list of Ru fluorides, where n is an even number:\n        *   If A4 = RuF₆ (n=6), then m=3, and A5 = RuF₃.\n        *   If A4 = RuF₄ (n=4), then m=2, and A5 = RuF₂.\n    *   Now we use the final clue: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n        *   If A5 = RuF₃, it is largely insoluble and stable in water, though it might hydrolyze. This is a weak fit for \"decomposes\".\n        *   If A5 = RuF₂, Ru(II) is unstable in aqueous solution and would readily disproportionate. A likely reaction is 3RuF₂ → 2RuF₃ + Ru. This produces two distinct substances (ruthenium(III) fluoride and ruthenium metal). This is a perfect fit for the clue.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Calculation.**\n    The most consistent scenario is:\n    *   Y = Ru\n    *   A4 = RuF₄\n    *   A5 = RuF₂\n    The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of A4.\n    A4 is RuF₄.\n    M(A4) = M(Ru) + 4 × M(F)\n    M(A4) = 101.07 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) = 101.07 + 76.00 = 177.07 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 177.07 g/mol falls within the range:\n    B) 160-180\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF&#x208_n) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The mass percentage can be expressed as:\n    `%F = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F) * 100`\n    Where `M_Y` is the atomic mass of element Y, `M_F` is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and `n` is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `M_Y`:\n    `M_Y = (n * M_F * (100 - %F)) / %F`\n    `M_Y = (n * 19.00 * (100 - 31.96)) / 31.96`\n    `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`\n\n    We can test integer values for `n` to find a plausible element Y:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 (resembles Calcium)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 (resembles Bromine)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 (resembles Antimony, Sb, with an atomic mass of 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.80\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25\n\n    The best fit is for n=3, where Y is Antimony (Sb). Let's verify the fluorine percentage for Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃):\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    %F = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100 = 31.89%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify substances A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (`A1 -> SbF₃ + F₂`). This indicates A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, which is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). A1 also oxidizes xenon, a known property of strong fluorinating agents like SbF₅ (`2SbF₅ + Xe -> [XeF][Sb₂F₁₁]`). While pure SbF₅ is colorless, the color mentioned might be due to impurities or specific conditions. The low decomposition temperature suggests high reactivity.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating antimony (`Sb + F₂ -> A3`) and also reacts with xenon. The fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ and then SbF₅. Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be the stronger oxidant, **SbF₅**. Thus, A1 and A3 are the same substance.\n\n3.  **Identify substances A4 and A5.**\n    *   The problem states that A5 is obtained by adding Y (Antimony, Sb) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio (`Sb + A4 -> A5`).\n    *   This is a reaction where elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) is added to a solution of another antimony compound (A4). This strongly suggests an oxidation-reduction reaction, where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must be an oxidizing agent.\n    *   In this chemical system, the oxidizing species would be Antimony(V). The most likely candidates for A4 are therefore SbF₅ or a related compound.\n    *   The description \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" points towards Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆), which is a superacid formed by mixing SbF₅ with hydrogen fluoride (HF). It exists as a colorless solution.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the possible candidates for A4 against the given options:\n        *   **SbF₃**: 178.76 g/mol. This falls into range A (160-180). However, A4 must be an oxidant for Sb(0), making Sb(III)F₃ a chemically inconsistent choice.\n        *   **SbF₅**: 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the ranges.\n        *   **HSbF₆**: 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol. This molecular weight falls perfectly within **range B (220-240)**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on its chemical role as an oxidant for elemental antimony and its description as a colorless solution, combined with the molecular weight calculation, A4 is identified as Fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆). The product A5 would be a compound of Antimony(III), likely SbF₃, which is known to decompose in water into two substances (e.g., SbOF and HF). The molecular weight of A4 (HSbF₆) is approximately 237 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can set up an equation to find the atomic weight of Y (Ar(Y)) in terms of n (the number of fluorine atoms).\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    where Ar(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    By rearranging the formula, we get:\n    Ar(Y) = n * (19.00 * (1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196) ≈ n * 40.45\n\n2.  **Test Plausible Candidates for Y:** We will test small integer values for `n` to find an element Y whose atomic weight matches the calculated Ar(Y).\n    *   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca, but CaF₂ has ɷF=48.7%)\n    *   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br, but bromine fluorides don't match ɷF)\n    *   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35. This is very close to Antimony (Sb), which has Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   Other candidates (like Pu for n=6) fit the mass percentage but are eliminated by other clues. For instance, the problem states A4 is part of a \"colorless concentrated solution\". Plutonium fluorides are all colored, which rules out Pu as element Y.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify Y as Antimony (Sb) and A2 as SbF₃.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4:** The problem states that A4 is a binary compound of Y (Sb) and fluorine, and it forms a colorless solution. The common binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ (white/colorless solid) and SbF₅ (colorless solid/liquid). So, A4 must be one of these two.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weights and Compare with Options:** We will calculate the molecular weights of our two candidates for A4 and see which one fits the given ranges.\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = Ar(Sb) + 3 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n        Molecular Weight (MW) = Ar(Sb) + 5 * Ar(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match with Given Ranges:**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 220-240\n    The calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range C (160-180). The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the ranges (it is close to, but outside of, range D).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the evidence, A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight falls in the range of 160-180. The other pieces of information in the problem (regarding substance A1 and the 1:1 reaction) seem to contain contradictions or refer to highly unusual chemistry, but the identification of A4 is robust based on the mass percentage and molecular weight options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify element Y and substance A2\n# Let Ar_Y be the atomic weight of element Y, and Ar_F be the atomic weight of Fluorine.\n# Let n be the number of fluorine atoms in A2.\n# The mass percentage of Fluorine in A2 is 31.96% or 0.3196.\n# 0.3196 = (n * Ar_F) / (Ar_Y + n * Ar_F)\nAr_F = 19.00\nw_F = 0.3196\n\n# Rearranging the formula to solve for Ar_Y:\n# Ar_Y = n * Ar_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n# Let's calculate the factor for n\nfactor = Ar_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n\n# Let's test integer values for n\n# n = 1: Ar_Y = 1 * factor\n# n = 2: Ar_Y = 2 * factor\n# n = 3: Ar_Y = 3 * factor\nn = 3\nAr_Y_calculated = n * factor\n# This calculated atomic weight is very close to Antimony (Sb), Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol.\n# So we conclude Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Identify A4 and calculate molecular weights.\n# A4 is a colorless binary fluoride of Antimony.\n# The possibilities are SbF3 and SbF5.\nAr_Sb = 121.76\n\n# Calculate MW of SbF3\nmw_sbf3 = Ar_Sb + 3 * Ar_F\n\n# Calculate MW of SbF5\nmw_sbf5 = Ar_Sb + 5 * Ar_F\n\n# Step 5 & 6: Compare with options and conclude.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (110, 130),\n    \"B\": (140, 160),\n    \"C\": (160, 180),\n    \"D\": (220, 240)\n}\n\nprint(f\"Based on mass percentage, element Y is likely Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated atomic weight for Y (with n=3) is {Ar_Y_calculated:.2f} g/mol, which is close to Ar(Sb) = {Ar_Sb} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nA4 is a colorless fluoride of Sb, so it could be SbF3 or SbF5.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of SbF3 is {mw_sbf3:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 is {mw_sbf5:.2f} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing these with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 110-130\")\nprint(f\"B) 140-160\")\nprint(f\"C) 160-180\")\nprint(f\"D) 220-240\")\n\n# Check which range fits\nfinal_choice = \"\"\nif options[\"A\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"A\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif options[\"B\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"B\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif options[\"C\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"C\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif options[\"D\"][0] <= mw_sbf3 <= options[\"D\"][1]:\n    final_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 ({mw_sbf3:.2f}) falls into range C.\")\n\nif options[\"A\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"A\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"B\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"B\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"C\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"C\"][1]:\n    pass\nelif options[\"D\"][0] <= mw_sbf5 <= options[\"D\"][1]:\n    pass\nelse:\n    print(f\"The molecular weight of SbF5 ({mw_sbf5:.2f}) does not fall neatly into any range.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, A4 is most likely SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180.\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}.\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Based on mass percentage, element Y is likely Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF3.\nThe calculated atomic weight for Y (with n=3) is 121.35 g/mol, which is close to Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol.\n\nA4 is a colorless fluoride of Sb, so it could be SbF3 or SbF5.\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 is 178.76 g/mol.\nThe molecular weight of SbF5 is 216.76 g/mol.\n\nComparing these with the given options:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76) falls into range C.\nThe molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76) does not fall neatly into any range.\n\nTherefore, A4 is most likely SbF3, and its molecular weight is in the range 160-180.\nThe correct option is C.\n<<<C>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the unknown element be Y, its molar mass be M(Y), and the formula of A2 be YFₓ. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for M(Y) in terms of x:\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00x) = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724x = 19.00x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276x\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nNow, we test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible element Y.\n*   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but CaF₂ is the common fluoride).\n*   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br).\n*   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to some lanthanides).\n*   If x = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bismuth, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the choice of Antimony (Sb). If Y = Sb and x = 3, then A2 = SbF₃.\nLet's calculate the exact mass fraction of fluorine in SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 121.76 + 56.994 = 178.754 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This strongly suggests that Y is Antimony (Sb) and A2 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 2: Use the chemical properties to identify other compounds (A1, A3).**\n*   \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂)\".\n    The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. By conservation of mass, A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common higher fluoride is SbF₅. So, A1 = SbF₅.\n    *Careful point:* The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" and decomposes at 293 K (20 °C). Pure SbF₅ is a colorless liquid and is stable at 293 K. This is a contradiction. In complex chemical problems, quantitative data (like mass percentage) is often more reliable than qualitative descriptions (like color), which might be simplified or contain errors. We will proceed with the identification Y=Sb based on the strong numerical evidence.\n*   \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\".\n    The reaction is Sb + F₂ → A3. Direct fluorination of antimony typically produces the highest stable fluoride, which is SbF₅. So, A3 = SbF₅.\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon\".\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and a powerful fluorinating agent that is known to react with xenon (e.g., to form compounds like [XeF]⁺[Sb₂F₁₁]⁻). This is consistent with A1 = A3 = SbF₅.\n\n**Step 3: Identify substance A4.**\nThe problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Sb). A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are these compounds. The main binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The other three \"known\" compounds might be less common or polymeric forms, but A4 is most likely one of the two stable fluorides.\n\nWe need to find the range in which the molecular weight (MW) of A4 falls. Let's calculate the molecular weights of our candidates for A4:\n*   MW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's compare these values with the given options:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within range A.\nThe calculated molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit into any of the ranges (it is close to range B, but not within it).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that A4 is SbF₃.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion.**\nBased on the quantitative data, the element Y is antimony (Sb). The substance A4 must be a binary fluoride of antimony. By comparing the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides with the given ranges, A4 is identified as SbF₃, whose molecular weight is approximately 179 g/mol. This value falls in the range 160-180. The information about the reaction to form A5 is complex and appears contradictory, but it is not necessary to solve for the molecular weight of A4.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial clues about Element Y and its compounds.**\n    *   There are five binary compounds of element Y with fluorine.\n    *   A1 and A3 can oxidize xenon (Xe). Xenon is a noble gas and is very unreactive. Only the most powerful oxidizing agents, typically high-oxidation state fluorides of certain elements, can react with it. This strongly suggests that Y is a platinum-group metal (like Ru, Rh, Pt) or an actinide (like U, Pu).\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K. This low decomposition temperature is characteristic of unstable, high-oxidation state compounds.\n\n2.  **Identify Element Y using the composition of A2.**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F2). This means A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. The reaction is: YF_x -> YF_y + (x-y)/2 F2, where A1 = YF_x and A2 = YF_y.\n    *   The mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n (for simplicity, we can use an empirical formula). The atomic mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    *   0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    *   Solving for M(Y):\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19 = n * 19\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19 - 0.3196 * n * 19\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = (1 - 0.3196) * n * 19\n        *   0.3196 * M(Y) = 0.6804 * n * 19\n        *   M(Y) = (0.6804 / 0.3196) * 19 * n\n        *   M(Y) ≈ 2.1289 * 19 * n ≈ 40.45 * n\n    *   We need to find an element Y and an integer n such that M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   Let's test our candidate elements:\n        *   Ruthenium (Ru): M(Ru) ≈ 101.1 g/mol. Then n = 101.1 / 40.45 ≈ 2.5. This suggests the empirical formula of A2 is YF_2.5, or Y2F5. Let's check the mass fraction for Ru2F5: ɷF = (5 * 19) / (2 * 101.1 + 5 * 19) = 95 / (202.2 + 95) = 95 / 297.2 ≈ 0.31965 or 31.965%. This is an excellent match.\n        *   Plutonium (Pu): M(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol. Then n = 244 / 40.45 ≈ 6.03. This suggests A2 is PuF6. Let's check the mass fraction for PuF6: ɷF = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is also a good match.\n\n3.  **Choose between Ruthenium (Ru) and Plutonium (Pu) by checking the molar mass of A4.**\n    *   The problem asks for the molar mass range of A4, which is another fluoride of Y.\n    *   **If Y is Pu:** The known fluorides are PuF3 (M≈301), PuF4 (M≈320), PuF6 (M≈358). None of these molar masses fall into the given answer choices (A: 140-160, B: 110-130, C: 160-180, D: 220-240). Therefore, Y is not Plutonium.\n    *   **If Y is Ru:** The known fluorides are RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, RuF6. Let's calculate their molar masses.\n        *   M(RuF3) = 101.1 + 3 * 19 = 158.1 g/mol. This falls in range **A) 140-160**.\n        *   M(RuF4) = 101.1 + 4 * 19 = 177.1 g/mol. This falls in range **C) 160-180**.\n        *   M(RuF5) = 101.1 + 5 * 19 = 196.1 g/mol.\n        *   M(RuF6) = 101.1 + 6 * 19 = 215.1 g/mol.\n    *   So, A4 must be either RuF3 or RuF4.\n\n4.  **Identify A4 using the reaction to form A5.**\n    *   The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This describes the reaction: Y + A4 → A5.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction, where element Y in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with a compound of Y in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form a product (A5) with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test the possibilities for A4:\n        *   **If A4 is RuF3 (Ru is +3):** The reaction is `Ru(0) + RuF3 -> ...`. A 1:1 molar ratio would lead to a product with an average oxidation state of +1.5, for example, `Ru2F3`. This is not a simple, common fluoride of ruthenium.\n        *   **If A4 is RuF4 (Ru is +4):** The reaction is `Ru(0) + RuF4 -> ...`. A 1:1 molar ratio leads to a product with an average oxidation state of +2. A balanced reaction is: `Ru + RuF4 → 2 RuF2`. This is a chemically plausible reaction, forming Ruthenium(II) fluoride.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidate for A4 is RuF4.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   Element Y is Ruthenium (Ru).\n    *   Compound A4 is Ruthenium(IV) fluoride (RuF4).\n    *   The molar mass of RuF4 is M(RuF4) = 101.1 + 4 * 19.00 = 177.1 g/mol.\n    *   This molar mass falls within the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests that element Y is Plutonium (Pu). The calculated atomic weight based on the mass fraction of fluorine in A2 (ɷF=31,96%) points towards Pu when the number of fluorine atoms is 6. The mass fraction of fluorine in PuF6 is approximately 31.84%, which is very close to the given value. Plutonium is also known to form multiple binary fluorides and its compounds are strong oxidizing agents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues and search results:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and A2**:\n    *   A2 is a binary fluoride of Y (YF_n) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    *   The atomic weight of Y can be expressed as Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   For n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu, Ar ≈ 244 g/mol).\n    *   Let's verify with Y = Pu and n = 6. A2 would be PuF6. The molar mass of PuF6 is 244 + 6 * 19 = 358 g/mol. The mass fraction of fluorine is (6 * 19) / 358 ≈ 31.84%. This is a strong match.\n    *   Therefore, **Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the five binary compounds**:\n    *   Plutonium is known to form several binary fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, and PuF6.\n    *   A fifth compound, PuF8, has been studied theoretically and is predicted to be unstable, decomposing to PuF6 and F2.\n    *   The five known binary compounds are likely **PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, and the theoretically known PuF8**.\n\n3.  **Identify A1**:\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance. PuF6 is a reddish-brown solid.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20°C) into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is A1 → PuF6 + F2.\n    *   This decomposition reaction points to A1 being **Plutonium octafluoride (PuF8)**. Theoretical calculations show that PuF8 is expected to decompose into PuF6 and F2.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. PuF6 is already an extremely strong oxidizing agent capable of this. PuF8 would be an even stronger oxidizing agent, consistent with this property.\n\n4.  **Identify A3**:\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Pu) with fluorine.\n    *   The direct fluorination of plutonium can yield PuF4 or PuF6 depending on the conditions.\n    *   A3 can also interact with xenon, implying it is a strong oxidizing agent. Both PuF4 (under harsh conditions) and PuF6 can react with or be catalysts for reactions involving xenon compounds. Given the context of powerful fluorinating agents, **A3 is most likely PuF6**, formed by the aggressive fluorination of plutonium metal.\n\n5.  **Identify A4 and A5**:\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y (Pu metal) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\n    *   Let's examine plutonium oxyfluorides, which can be formed from reactions involving plutonium fluorides and an oxygen source (like water in a \"solution\").\n    *   A key reaction is the hydrolysis of plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6) in water, which produces plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). The reaction is: PuF6 + 2H2O → PuO2F2 + 4HF.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **A4 is Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2)**.\n    *   The problem states A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". PuO2F2 can be handled in solution.\n    *   The reaction to form A5 is: Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n        Pu + PuO2F2 → A5\n    *   This suggests a comproportionation reaction. Plutonium is in the 0 oxidation state, and in PuO2F2, it is in the +6 oxidation state. A reaction between them could yield an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Pu(0) + Pu(VI)O2F2 → 2 Pu(III)OF?\n    *   A known, stable plutonium oxyfluoride is **PuOF** (plutonium(III) oxyfluoride). So, the reaction could be: Pu + PuO2F2 → 2PuOF. This fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants Pu and PuO2F2 to form the product A5 (PuOF).\n    *   Therefore, **A5 is Plutonium(III) oxyfluoride (PuOF)**.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 (PuOF) decomposes in water into two substances. PuOF does not dissolve in water but would likely react/decompose under certain conditions, potentially forming Pu(OH)3 and HF, or other plutonium oxide/hydroxide species and fluoride ions.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4**:\n    *   Based on the deductions above, **A4 is Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2)**.\n    *   We need to calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of PuO2F2 = 244 + (2 * 16) + (2 * 19) = 244 + 32 + 38 = 314 g/mol.\n\n7.  **Re-evaluating A4 and A5 with another possibility**:\n    *   Let's reconsider the reaction for A5. What if A4 is a plutonium fluoride in solution?\n    *   PuF6 (A2 or A3) reacts violently with water, so a \"solution of A4\" is less likely to be PuF6.\n    *   Could A4 be PuF4? PuF4 is a solid. Let's assume a solution of a complex fluoride.\n    *   Let's stick with the most plausible identification from the reaction stoichiometry.\n    *   The identification of A4 as PuO2F2 seems the most chemically sound. However, the molecular weight of 314 g/mol does not fall into any of the given ranges. This indicates an error in my deduction or an issue with the problem statement/options.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nWhat if Y is not Pu? Let's reconsider Krypton (Kr).\n*   Y = Kr, A2 = KrF2. ɷF = 31.2%, close but not as close as Pu.\n*   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a major problem for Krypton. Only KrF2 is well-established.\n*   The high reactivity and colors are more consistent with a heavy element like Plutonium.\n\nLet's re-examine the compounds of Plutonium.\nPuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuF8.\nA1: PuF8\nA2: PuF6\nA3: PuF6\n\n\"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nWhat if A4 is not a plutonium compound but the solvent? The wording \"solution of A4\" makes this unlikely. It implies A4 is the solute.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 = PuF4 (M=320 g/mol), could a solution be made? PuF4 is poorly soluble.\nIf A4 = PuO2F2 (M=314 g/mol).\nIf A5 = PuOF (M=279 g/mol). Reaction: Pu + PuO2F2 -> 2PuOF.

M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3*19)/178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n*   So, **Y = Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n*   **Five binary compounds of Sb and F?** Only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. This premise is weak for Sb as well. However, in the context of a puzzle, perhaps it refers to less stable or complex species.\n*   **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine.** A1 -> SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 is SbF5. Reaction: SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2. This decomposition is known to occur at higher temperatures, but maybe at 293K under specific conditions.\n*   **A1 (SbF5) is bright-red.** SbF5 is a colorless, viscous liquid/solid. This contradicts the \"bright-red\" description.\n*   **A1 (SbF5) oxidizes xenon.** SbF5 is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, it reacts with XeF2 to form salts. Plausible.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine.** Sb + F2 -> SbF5. So **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A3 (SbF5) can also interact with xenon.** Yes, this is correct.\n*   **A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.**\n    Sb + A4 -> A5.\n*   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n\nNow we need to identify A4 and A5 in the antimony system. The reaction is Sb(0) + A4 -> A5. This is a comproportionation. A4 must be a compound with Sb in a positive oxidation state. The most likely candidate for A4 is SbF5, and for A5 is SbF3.\nReaction: 2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. The molar ratio is not 1:1.\n\nLet's reconsider the plutonium hypothesis, as the chemistry seems more consistent despite the molecular weight mismatch. Is there any other compound that could be A4?\n\nPerhaps A4 is not a plutonium compound. The problem states a \"solution of A4\". What if A4 is an acid?\n\"adding Y (Pu) ... to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"\nMaybe A4 is an acid like HClO4 or H2SO4. This seems unlikely as it deviates from the \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\" theme.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my chain of logic for Pu and re-examine the molecular weights of *all* possible compounds.\nPuF3 = 301.06\nPuF4 = 320.06\nPuF5 = 339.05\nPuF6 = 358.05\nPuOF = 279.06\nPuO2F2 = 314.05\nPuF8 = 396.04\n\nNone of these fit. Let's reconsider Y = Kr.\nKrF2 = 121.8. This fits in range C (110-130). Could A4 be KrF2?\nA2 was KrF2. A3 could be KrF2. Let's test if A4 is KrF2.\n*   Y = Krypton (Kr)\n*   A2 = KrF2 (ɷF ≈ 31.2%, close to 31.96%).\n*   A1 = KrF4 (decomposes to KrF2 + F2).\n*   A3 = KrF2 (from Kr + F2).\n*   A4 = KrF2.\n*   Reaction to get A5: Y(Kr) + A4(KrF2) -> A5. (1:1 molar ratio). Kr + KrF2 -> A5. This reaction doesn't seem to lead to a known stable product.\n*   Also, the \"five binary compounds\" issue persists.\n\nThere seems to be a significant inconsistency in the problem statement, the options, and known chemistry. However, let's revisit the first deduction, which had the best fit for the mass percentage.\nY = Pu, A2 = PuF6.\nLet's assume my identification of A4 is wrong and that A4's molecular weight *must* fall into one of the ranges. Let's look for any other plausible compound.\n\nWhat if \"binary compounds\" includes oxyfluorides? This is a stretch of the definition, but possible in a puzzle context.\nThe five compounds could be: PuF4, PuF6, PuOF, PuO2F2, and another one.\n\nLet's work backward from the answers.\nA) 140-160: ?\nB) 160-180: ? Could match SbF3 (178.76). But the red color of A1 (SbF5) is wrong.\nC) 110-130: ? Could match KrF2 (121.8). But \"five compounds\" is wrong.\nD) 220-240: ?\n\nLet's try one more element. Y=Ruthenium (Ru). Ar(Ru) = 101.07.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n101.07 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 2.5. Doesn't fit well.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Pu and assume A4 is an unusual species or there's a typo in the problem.\nIf A4 had to be in one of those ranges, which part of my deduction is most likely wrong? The identification of A4=PuO2F2 is based on interpreting the formation of A5.\nPu + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nLet's rethink. If A4 is PuF4 (MW=320), the reaction could be: Pu + 3PuF4 -> 4PuF3. Ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\nIf A4 is PuF6 (MW=358), the reaction could be: 2Pu + PuF6 -> 3PuF2 (hypothetical) or other mixtures. 2Pu + PuF6 -> 3PuF4 is not balanced. Pu + 2PuF6 -> 3PuF4. Not 1:1.\n\nThe reaction `Pu + PuO2F2 → 2PuOF` is stoichiometrically sound (1:1) and involves known (though perhaps uncommon) species. The MW of PuO2F2 is 314. This is outside all ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider the question's source. It might be from a specific curriculum or competition where certain non-standard facts are assumed. Is there any other interpretation of \"five binary compounds\"? Maybe it includes anions like PuF7^- or PuF8^2-? But these are not binary compounds *of fluorine with element Y*.\n\nGiven the contradictions, let's review the most solid piece of evidence: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n leading to Y=Pu and A2=PuF6. The chemical properties align well with Plutonium.\n- Five fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuF8).\n- A1(PuF8) -> A2(PuF6) + F2.\n- Strong oxidizer, reacts with Xenon (PuF6, PuF8).\n- A3 (PuF6) from fluorination of Pu.\n- A5 from Pu + A4.\n\nThe problem seems to hinge on identifying A4. All evidence points to A4 being PuO2F2, but its molecular weight (314) doesn't fit the options. Let's re-read again. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2) is a solid. It can be formed from hydrolysis of PuF6. Perhaps it forms a complex in solution.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and my identification of A4=PuO2F2 is correct, and the question is flawed. But I must choose an answer.\nIs there any other possibility for Y?\nY = Technetium (Tc), Ar = 98. 98 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 2.42. No.\nY = Neptunium (Np), Ar = 237. 237 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 5.86. This is also very close to n=6. Let's test Y = Np.\n*   A2 = NpF6. M(NpF6) = 237 + 6*19 = 351 g/mol.\n    ɷF(NpF6) = (6*19)/351 = 114/351 ≈ 32.48%. This is also close to 31.96%.\n*   Neptunium chemistry is similar to Plutonium. It forms NpF3, NpF4, NpF5, NpF6.\n*   Let's check A4, which would be NpO2F2. M(NpO2F2) = 237 + 32 + 38 = 307 g/mol. Still not in the ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider Sb. Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. MW=178.76. ɷF=31.88%. This is a very good fit.\nA1 is bright-red. SbF5 is colorless. This is the main contradiction. If we ignore the color, does the rest fit?\n- A1(SbF5) -> A2(SbF3) + F2. (Decomposition).\n- A1(SbF5) oxidizes Xe. Plausible.\n- A3 is SbF5 (from Sb + F2).\n- A3(SbF5) interacts with Xe. Plausible.\n- Reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\n- What could A4 and A5 be? Maybe A4 is an antimony oxyfluoride. Or maybe the reaction is different. What about addition? Sb + SbF3 -> Sb2F3? Not a simple compound.\n- SbF5 is A3. Could A4 also be SbF5? Reaction: Sb + SbF5 -> ? Does not seem to be a simple 1:1 reaction.\n\nIf we assume Y=Sb, then A2=SbF3 has a molecular weight of ~179. This is in range B. If we assume A4 is A2, this could be the answer. But there is no reason to assume A4 is A2. The color mismatch for A1 is also a strong counterargument.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. It seems the most likely candidate for Y, and the chemistry fits well, except for the final step matching the options. There must be a mistake in the problem's data or options. Let me assume my identification of A4 is wrong, and one of the other Pu-F compounds is A4, and that the description of its formation is misleading. This is a weak path.\n\nLet's try a different approach. What if A5 is PuF4? Then 3Pu + Pu(X) -> 4PuF4. What if A5 is PuF3? Pu + 3A4 -> 4PuF3. If A4 is PuF4, then Pu + 3PuF4 -> 4PuF3. Ratio 1:3.\n\nThis problem is very difficult due to the inconsistencies. Let me reconsider the calculation for Y.\nAr(Y) = 40.449 * n.\nn=1, Ar=40.4 (Ca)\nn=2, Ar=80.9 (Br) -> BrF. ɷF = 19 / (79.9+19) = 19.2%. No. A2=BrF3. ɷF = 57 / (79.9+57) = 41.6%. No. A2=BrF5. ɷF = 95 / (79.9+95) = 47.9%. No.\nn=3, Ar=121.3 (Sb) -> SbF3. ɷF = 31.88%. Match.\nn=4, Ar=161.8 (Dy) -> DyF3. ɷF= 57 / (162.5+57) = 26%. No.\nn=5, Ar=202.2 (Hg, Tl) -> TlF3. ɷF=57 / (204.4+57) = 21.8%. No.\nn=6, Ar=242.7 (Pu) -> PuF6. ɷF = 31.84%. Match.\n\nSo it's either Sb or Pu.\nIf Y=Sb:\nA1=SbF5 (not red)\nA2=SbF3 (MW=178.8)\nA3=SbF5\nA4=? A5=?\nIf A4 were, for example, SbF3, its MW is 178.8, which is in range **B**.\n\nIf Y=Pu:\nA1=PuF8 (hypothetical, but fits decomposition)\nA2=PuF6 (MW=358.0)\nA3=PuF6\nA4=PuO2F2 (MW=314, based on reaction)\nA5=PuOF\nThis seems more chemically sound, but MW of A4 does not fit any option.\n\nLet's reconsider the Sb case. What if \"bright-red\" is a mistake in the problem? Then Y=Sb is a strong possibility. If we assume Y=Sb, then what is A4? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 can be a colorless liquid. Reaction: Sb + SbF5 (1:1). A known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. Maybe there's another reaction, or the stoichiometry is a red herring. What if A5 is a complex salt? If we have a solvent `solv`, maybe Sb + SbF5 + solv -> [Sb(solv)][SbF5] or something similar? This is too speculative.\nThe simplest assumption if Y=Sb is that A4 is one of the known fluorides, SbF3 or SbF5.\nMW(SbF3) = 178.8 -> Range B\nMW(SbF5) = 216.8 -> outside all ranges.\nSo, if Y=Sb, the only option that could fit is if A4 is SbF3. Let's see if the reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 makes sense. This would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is not typical.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. What if the \"five binary compounds\" include oxides? PuO, PuO2, Pu2O3, PuF4, PuF6? This violates \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\n\nWhat if the element is **Osmium (Os)**? Ar(Os) = 190.23.\n190.23 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 4.7. Maybe n=5? OsF5.\nɷF(OsF5) = (5*19)/(190.23+95) = 95/285.23 = 33.3%. Not a great fit.\nWhat about n=4? OsF4. ɷF(OsF4) = (4*19)/(190.23+76) = 76/266.23 = 28.5%. Not good.\n\nLet's trust the math. The best fits are Pu and Sb.\nPu: Fits most chemical clues, but MW of A4 doesn't match options.\nSb: Fits MW clue for A2 perfectly. One major contradiction (color of A1). The reaction for A5 is unclear. But if we assume A4 is SbF3, its MW (178.8) is in range B.\n\nThis feels like a choice between two imperfect candidates. The mass percent is a very specific number.\nɷF(SbF3) = 31.88% -> difference of |31.88 - 31.96| = 0.08\nɷF(PuF6) = 31.84% -> difference of |31.84 - 31.96| = 0.12\nThe fit for Sb is slightly better. The main obstacle is the color of SbF5. Could \"bright-red\" refer to a complex or an impure substance? It's possible. Given the options, the path with Antimony (Sb) leads to a potential answer.\nLet's assume Y = Sb.\nA2 = SbF3.\nThen A4 could also be SbF3. Molecular Weight is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nLet's try to rationalize this choice.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF3.\nA1 decomposes to SbF3 and F2 -> A1=SbF5. Let's ignore the color discrepancy for a moment.\nA1 oxidizes Xe -> SbF5 does.\nA3 from Sb + F2 -> A3=SbF5.\nA3 interacts with Xe -> SbF5 does.\nA5 from Sb + A4 (1:1). If A4 is SbF3, the reaction is Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This could form sub-fluorides like (SbF)n or clusters. It's plausible in molten salt chemistry.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF3, its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. This falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nLet's check the Plutonium path one last time. Is there any Pu compound in the ranges? No. Therefore, despite the compelling chemical arguments for Pu, it cannot lead to one of the provided answers. The Sb path, despite the color contradiction, leads to a plausible molecular weight for A4=A2=SbF3, which is 178.8 g/mol, fitting in range B. The question might be constructed such that A4 is the same as A2.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1. Identify Y from ɷF(A2). Both Sb and Pu are good candidates based on the math.\n2. Analyze chemical properties. Pu fits better overall, especially the \"five compounds\" and colors. Sb has a major color discrepancy for A1.\n3. Analyze the formation of A5. The reaction for Pu (Pu + PuO2F2) is plausible but gives MW(A4)=314, which is not an option. The reaction for Sb is less clear.\n4. Work backward from the options. Range B (160-180) perfectly contains MW(SbF3) = 178.8. If we assume A4=A2=SbF3, this path leads to an answer. No other plausible compound from either the Sb or Pu systems fits any of the other ranges.\n5. Conclusion: The most likely intended answer, despite the flaws in the problem description, is based on Y=Sb and A4=SbF3.\n\nMolecular weight of A4 = SbF3 = 121.76 + 3*18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\nThis value falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where n is the number of fluorine atoms and Y is the unknown element.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine can be expressed as:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\n    Using the atomic weight of Fluorine (Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol) and the given mass fraction (0.3196):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19)\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` (a plausible oxidation state for an element Y) that gives a realistic atomic weight Ar(Y).\n    *   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, but CaF is not a stable compound).\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br or Se).\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   If n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dy, a lanthanide).\n    *   If n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Hg, Tl, Pb).\n    *   If n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu, with Ar(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Verify the best candidates for Y.**\n    Let's check the theoretical mass fraction of fluorine for the most promising candidates:\n    *   **If Y = Sb and n = 3 (A2 = SbF₃):**\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **If Y = Pu and n = 6 (A2 = PuF₆):**\n        ɷF(PuF₆) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also very close.\n\n3.  **Use other clues to distinguish between Sb and Pu.**\n    *   The problem states \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\" This means A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2 (A1 → A2 + F₂).\n    *   If Y = Pu, then A2 = PuF₆. A1 would have to be a fluoride with more than 6 fluorine atoms (e.g., PuF₇ or PuF₈), which are not known to exist as stable compounds. This makes Plutonium an unlikely candidate.\n    *   If Y = Sb, then A2 = SbF₃. A1 could be SbF₅, which has a higher fluorine content. The decomposition would be SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂.\n\n    While the properties of A1 (bright-red, decomposes at 293 K) do not perfectly match those of SbF₅ (which is a colorless, stable liquid), the existence of a higher fluoride is chemically sound. Other clues in the problem are often more reliable than physical properties which can be misstated. The mass fraction calculation strongly points to Antimony (Sb).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    Let's assume Y is Antimony (Sb). The known binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. These, along with potential polymeric or complex forms, would constitute the \"five binary compounds\". Substance A4 must be one of these. The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of A4.\n\n    Let's calculate the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides:\n    *   **MW(SbF₃):** 121.76 + 3 * 19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   **MW(SbF₅):** 121.76 + 5 * 19 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Molecular Weight with the given ranges.**\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range A (160-180).\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any range, although it is closest to range D.\n\n    Based on the perfect fit of MW(SbF₃) into range A, it is highly probable that A4 is SbF₃. The other descriptive parts of the problem (e.g., the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) might be flawed or intended to be misleading, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. The numerical data (mass fraction and molecular weight) provide the most direct path to the solution.\n\nTherefore, the substance A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and answer the question:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 is YF_n. The molar mass of element Y (M_Y) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M_F ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the equation:\n\nM_Y = ((1 - 0.3196) / 0.3196) * n * M_F\nM_Y ≈ (0.6804 / 0.3196) * 19.00 * n\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n':\n*   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium or Argon, which are unlikely candidates).\n*   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but BrF3 and BrF5 are the common fluorides, and their fluorine percentages do not match).\n*   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's check the fluorine percentage in SbF3: ω(F) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no stable element fits well).\n\nTherefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and compound **A2 is SbF3** (antimony trifluoride).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Five Binary Fluorides of Antimony\n\nAntimony is known to form several binary fluorides. The main ones are SbF3 and SbF5. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is a powerful Lewis acid and can accept a fluoride ion (F-) to form complex anions like [SbF6]⁻, [Sb2F11]⁻, and [Sb3F16]⁻. This suggests the five compounds are likely related to these species or polymeric forms. The known binary fluorides or fluoride adducts are SbF3, SbF5, and anions formed with SbF5, such as those in K[SbF6], K[Sb2F11], and K[Sb3F16]. While not strictly binary compounds of only Y and F in the neutral sense, in the context of this problem, the polyfluoride anions are key. A search also reveals polymeric fluorides.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Compounds A1 and A3\n\n*   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20°C) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. It also oxidizes xenon. This points to a highly reactive, unstable, high-oxidation-state fluoride. While a simple higher binary fluoride of antimony like SbF7 is not well-established, polymeric or complex fluorides can be highly reactive. The description of a bright-red solid that decomposes near room temperature and oxidizes xenon is characteristic of some extremely powerful fluorinating agents, such as dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), also known as \"FOOF\". However, the problem states these are compounds of Y and Fluorine. A compound like tetrameric ruthenium pentafluoride, (RuF5)4, is known to be a dark red solid. In the realm of antimony, there are complex polymeric fluorides, but none are commonly described as bright-red. However, given the clues, A1 must be a higher fluoride that decomposes to the more stable SbF3. The decomposition is A1 → SbF3 + F2.\n\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and can also react with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony produces antimony trifluoride (SbF3) or, with excess fluorine, antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be a very strong oxidizing agent. **SbF5** is an exceptionally strong Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing oxygen and being a component of superacids. Therefore, **A3 is SbF5**.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Compounds A4 and A5\n\nThe problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThe reaction is: Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\nSubstituting Y = Sb, we have: **Sb + A4 → A5**.\n\nThis is a comproportionation reaction where antimony metal reduces a higher-oxidation-state antimony fluoride (A4) to an intermediate one (A5).\n*   **A4** must be a stable, higher-valent fluoride of antimony. The most stable and common higher fluoride is **SbF5**. SbF5 is a colorless, viscous liquid.\n*   If A4 is SbF5, the reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. For a 1:1 molar ratio to be significant, it might imply a structural change. A known reaction involves the combination of antimony species. Let's consider the oxidation states. Sb(0) + Sb(+5) → ? A likely product would be an intermediate oxidation state, which is Sb(+3). So, the product A5 should be related to SbF3. However, the stoichiometry doesn't balance for a simple redox reaction (Sb + SbF5 -> 2SbF3 is not 1:1).\n\nLet's re-examine the clue. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 is a liquid that can act as a solvent. The reaction could be forming a complex ion. A plausible reaction series is the formation of complex fluorides.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5. If A4 is SbF5, and A5 is SbF3, this doesn't fit the molar ratio.\n\nLet's look at the properties of A5. \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" SbF3 hydrolyzes, but this is a general property.\n\nLet's revisit the known fluorides and their reactions. We have identified A2=SbF3 and A3=SbF5. A1 is an unstable higher fluoride. This leaves A4 and A5.\nThe most common and stable fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5.\nIt is plausible that A4 is one of these, and A5 is another.\n\nLet's assume **A4 is SbF5**. The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This doesn't lead to a simple binary compound.\nLet's assume **A4 is SbF3**. Then Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is unlikely.\n\nThere must be a different interpretation. Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. What if they are (SbF3), (SbF5), and related complex anions [Sb2F11]⁻, [Sb3F16]⁻, etc? The problem states *binary compounds*. This usually implies only two elements. The anions themselves aren't neutral compounds.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5. What if A4 is not a simple fluoride? The problem refers to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This could imply A4 is a solute.\nConsider a different reaction: The reaction between antimony trichloride and antimony trifluoride can produce antimony chloride fluoride.\n\nLet's reconsider the most straightforward interpretation:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF3\n*   A3 = SbF5\n*   A1 = An unstable higher fluoride of Sb.\n*   A4 and A5 are two other distinct binary fluorides.\n\nA known structural form of antimony pentafluoride is the tetramer, (SbF5)4. There are also polymeric forms. Let's stick with the simplest species first: SbF3 and SbF5. What could the other three be? Perhaps polymeric forms like (SbF3)n, (SbF5)n (e.g., n=4), and a mixed-valence compound. A well-known mixed-valence fluoride is Sb2F11⁻, formed from SbF5 and SbF6⁻.\n\nLet's go back to the most solid clue: A2 (ωF=31.96%) is SbF3.\nAnd A3 (strong oxidant, made by fluorinating Y) is SbF5.\nNow for the A4/A5 reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nIf A4 = SbF5, we have Sb + SbF5 -> A5. A 1:1 reaction could point to the formation of a dimeric species of an intermediate oxidation state, like [Sb-Sb]F5. This is highly speculative.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The options for the molecular weight of A4 are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weights of our candidate compounds:\n*   **SbF3**: 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n*   **SbF5**: 121.76 + 5*19.00 = 216.76 g/mol\n\nLet's analyze the ranges:\n*   A) 110-130: Doesn't match SbF3 or SbF5.\n*   B) 160-180: This range includes the molecular weight of **SbF3** (178.76 g/mol).\n*   C) 220-240: This range is slightly too high for SbF5.\n*   D) 140-160: Doesn't match SbF3 or SbF5.\n\nIf **A4 is SbF3**, its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which falls squarely in the range of 160-180. Let's see if this fits the remaining clues.\n\nIf A4 = SbF3, the reaction is: Sb + SbF3 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio, in a hot concentrated solution).\nThis is a reaction between Sb(0) and Sb(III). This is a comproportionation to a lower oxidation state, Sb(I) or Sb(II), for example, something like \"SbF\". While SbF is not a stable molecule, subhalides of antimony exist. This path seems chemically less plausible than the oxidation of Sb metal by a higher valent fluoride.\n\nLet's re-read the A4/A5 clue carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the *synthesis* of A5. A4 is the starting material.\nLet's assume there was a typo in the molecular weight ranges and A4 is SbF5 (MW = 216.76). Range C is 220-240. This is close. If A4=SbF5, then Sb + SbF5 -> A5.\n\nThere must be a key piece of information being missed or misinterpreted. Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. Rhenium, Osmium, and Ruthenium also form multiple fluorides, but the mass percentage calculation pointed strongly to Antimony.\n\nLet's trust the calculation that A2 = SbF3 (MW = 178.76).\nLet's trust the logic that A3 = SbF5 (MW = 216.76).\n\nNow, let's revisit the options and our calculated molecular weights.\n*   MW(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol -> Fits range B (160-180)\n*   MW(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol -> Does not fit any range perfectly, but is closest to C (220-240).\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of **A4**.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Sb(Y) + A4 -> A5.\nThis reaction involves adding the element itself to one of its fluorides. This is a common way to produce a lower-valent halide from a higher-valent one (comproportionation).\nExample: 2 SbF5 + Sb -> (doesn't work well)\nExample: SiCl4 + Si -> 2 SiCl2 (at high temp)\nExample: PCl5 + P(red) -> PCl3 (not 1:1)\n\nThis implies that A4 has a higher oxidation state than A5. Therefore, A4 is likely SbF5. If A4=SbF5, the MW is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fit any of the provided ranges well.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. What if the element Y is not Antimony?\nLet's recheck the mass percentage calculation for A2: M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n.\nIf n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (162.5) or Terbium (158.9), but they are not known for forming 5 volatile/reactive fluorides.\nIf n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is close to Bismuth (209.0). Let's check BiF5. ω(F) in BiF5 = (5 * 19) / (209 + 5*19) = 95 / 304 ≈ 31.25%. This is also a good match for 31.96%. Let's check BiF3: MW=266. BiF5: MW=304. Neither of these fit the A2 criteria.\n\nLet's return to Antimony (Sb) as the most probable identity for Y.\nA2 = SbF3 (MW ≈ 179).\nA3 = SbF5 (MW ≈ 217).\n\nLet's assume A4 is SbF3.\nMW(A4) = 178.76 g/mol. This falls in range **B) 160-180**.\nThe reaction becomes Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This is chemically strange. It would imply creating a sub-fluoride.\n\nLet's assume A4 is SbF5.\nMW(A4) = 216.76 g/mol. This is closest to range C (220-240).\nThe reaction becomes Sb + SbF5 -> A5. This is a comproportionation and is more chemically plausible. For example, it could form a mixed-valence compound.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction between the chemical logic (which suggests A4 is the higher fluoride, SbF5) and the given molecular weight ranges (where SbF3 fits perfectly into one range, while SbF5 fits poorly into another).\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement.\n*   A1: Bright-red, decomposes to A2 + F2. So A1 is a higher fluoride than A2.\n*   A2: ωF=31.96% -> SbF3.\n*   A3: Y + F2 -> A3. Reacts with Xe. -> SbF5.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\n\nThe reaction Y + A4 -> A5 strongly suggests A4 is a higher oxidation state fluoride and A5 is a lower one. So A4 should be SbF5. But its MW of 216.76 doesn't fit the ranges well.\n\nWhat if there is a mistake in my identification of A2?\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n. What if Y is Ruthenium (Ru, MW=101.1)?\nn=2 -> M_Y ≈ 80.9.\nn=3 -> M_Y ≈ 121.4.\nRuthenium forms RuF3, RuF4, RuF5, RuF6. That's four. Maybe (RuF5)4 is the fifth?\nLet's check ω(F) in RuF3: (3*19)/(101.1+57) = 57/158.1 ≈ 36.05%. Doesn't match.\nLet's check ω(F) in RuF4: (4*19)/(101.1+76) = 76/177.1 ≈ 42.9%. Doesn't match.\n\nLet's stick to Antimony. The evidence for Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 is strong.\nA2 = SbF3 (MW=178.76)\nA3 = SbF5 (MW=216.76)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the A4/A5 reaction. Is it possible that the roles are reversed? A4 + Y -> A5.\nMaybe A4 is a lower fluoride and it reacts with more Sb metal to form a cluster or subhalide. This is less common.\n\nLet's assume the most chemically sound process: comproportionation of a high-valent fluoride.\nA4 = SbF5. MW = 216.76. The closest range is C) 220-240. The discrepancy is about 1.5%.\nLet's assume A4 = SbF3. MW = 178.76. This fits perfectly in range B) 160-180.\nThe chemical reaction for A4=SbF3 is Sb(s) + SbF3(solution) -> A5. This is not a standard, simple reaction.\n\nHowever, in puzzle-like chemistry problems, sometimes a perfect fit for a numerical value is the intended clue, even if the associated chemistry is obscure. The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76) fits perfectly inside the 160-180 range. The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76) is outside the 220-240 range.\n\nIf we accept A4 = SbF3, then what is A5? Sb + SbF3 -> A5. And A5 decomposes in water into two substances. The nature of A5 is unclear, but we don't need to identify it, only A4.\n\nLet's weigh the evidence:\n1.  **Chemical Logic**: The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 suggests A4 is the higher-valent fluoride, SbF5.\n2.  **Numerical Fit**: The MW of SbF3 (178.76) fits perfectly in range B. The MW of SbF5 (216.76) does not fit well in any range.\n\nPerhaps the phrasing \"adding Y... to a ... solution of A4\" implies that Y is reacting with A4. It does not strictly mean A4 is the oxidant. However, it's the most common interpretation.\n\nLet's consider if the problem has a subtle trap. What if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride? The question asks for the molecular weight of \"substance A4\". For example, SbF5 can react with HF to form H[SbF6]. Could A4 be an acid? The problem says \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\". H[SbF6] is not a binary compound of Sb and F.\n\nLet's go with the strongest piece of evidence, which is the numerical match.\n*   Element Y is Antimony (Sb).\n*   A2 is SbF3. Its molecular weight is ~178.8 g/mol.\n*   The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n*   Range B is 160-180 g/mol.\n*   SbF3 fits perfectly in this range.\n*   Let's hypothesize that A4 = SbF3.\n\nThe reaction is then Sb is added to a solution of SbF3 to make A5. While this is an unusual reaction, it is not impossible that it forms some sub-fluoride species A5 in solution, which then hydrolyzes. The key point is that we must identify one of the five binary compounds. SbF3 is one of them. Its molecular weight matches one of the ranges perfectly. SbF5 is another, but its molecular weight does not match any range well. Given that A4 must be one of the five compounds, and SbF3 is one of them, the most logical choice based on the given numeric ranges is that A4 is SbF3.\n\nFinal check:\n- Y = Sb\n- A1 = unstable higher fluoride (e.g. polymeric)\n- A2 = SbF3 (ωF ~31.9%)\n- A3 = SbF5 (oxidizes Xe)\n- A4 = SbF3 (MW = 178.76 g/mol, fits range 160-180)\n- A5 = product of Sb + SbF3.\nThis set of assignments is consistent with the clues, especially the numerical ones.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote its formula as YF_n) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    Where M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196) = 19n * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 * n) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible molar mass for element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Argon)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Very close to Bromine, M(Br) = 79.9 g/mol)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No stable element)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury, M(Hg) = 200.6 g/mol)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Plutonium-242 or Americium-243)\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates based on other chemical properties.**\n    The problem states that substance A1 is bright-red and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. It decomposes into A2 and fluorine (A1 -> A2 + F2).\n    *   **Candidate Pu:** A1 would need to be a higher fluoride than A2=PuF6, which is unlikely. While PuF6 is reddish and oxidizes xenon, if A1=PuF6, then A2=PuF4. The mass percentage of F in PuF4 is ~23.8%, which is far from the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Candidate Sb:** A2=SbF3. The mass percentage is a very good fit (31.88%). This would imply A1=SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid and does not oxidize elemental xenon. This contradicts the properties of A1.\n    *   **Candidate Br:** A2=BrF2. Let's calculate the mass percentage of F in BrF2 precisely: ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (79.90 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 117.90 ≈ 0.3223 or 32.23%. This is very close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of only 0.8%). While BrF2 is a radical, this numerical fit is strong. Let's proceed with Y=Bromine as a hypothesis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the remaining clues with Y = Bromine.**\n    *   Y = Br.\n    *   A2 = BrF2 (from mass % calculation).\n    *   A1 -> A2 + F2 implies A1 -> BrF2 + F2. For this decomposition to be stoichiometrically balanced, A1 must be BrF4. (BrF4 -> BrF2 + F2). This also identifies A1 as a radical species.\n    *   Properties of A1=BrF4: The problem states it's bright-red, decomposes at 293K, and oxidizes xenon. While bromine fluorides are typically colorless, BrF is reddish. As BrF4 is an unstable radical, these properties are plausible in the context of a complex chemistry problem.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    The crucial clue is the formation of A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is Y + A4 -> A5, where Y=Br.\n    The most straightforward interpretation of this type of reaction is a comproportionation, where an element in its elemental state reacts with one of its compounds to form a compound of an intermediate oxidation state. A general form is Y + YF_x -> 2 YF_(x/2).\n    This implies a relationship between the formulas of A4 and A5. Let's try to identify A4 by working backward from the given answer options. The options are ranges for the molecular weight of A4.\n\n    Let's assume the reaction is of the type Y + YF_x -> 2YF_{x/2}. This means A4 = YF_x.\n    Let's assume option D is correct, meaning M(A4) is in the range [140-160].\n    M(A4) = M(Y) + x * M(F)\n    Since we hypothesized Y=Br (M≈79.9), we can solve for x:\n    79.9 + x * 19 ≈ [140, 160]\n    x * 19 ≈ [60.1, 80.1]\n    x ≈ [3.16, 4.21]\n    The only integer value for x in this range is **x=4**.\n\n    This implies that **A4 = BrF4**. Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(BrF4) = M(Br) + 4 * M(F) = 79.90 + 4 * 19.00 = 79.90 + 76.00 = **155.9 g/mol**.\n\n    This value, 155.9 g/mol, falls perfectly within the range of option D) 140-160.\n\n5.  **Final Check.**\n    The identification Y=Br leads to A2=BrF2 based on the mass percentage. It also leads to A4=BrF4 based on the molecular weight options. This is consistent, as A1 (which decomposes to A2) could be the same substance as A4 (A1=A4=BrF4). The chemistry involves unstable radical species, but the numerical evidence from two different clues (mass percentage and molecular weight range) converges on this single answer. The other candidates (Pu, Sb) lead to irreconcilable contradictions with the given options or chemical properties.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 is 155.9 g/mol, which falls in the range 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Fraction of Fluorine in Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). The atomic mass of fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)):\n    Ar(Y) = n × Ar(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (3.1289 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    Now, we test integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass for a known element:\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Krypton, Kr, with Ar=83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, with Ar=121.76 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidates using Chemical Properties.**\n    We must use the other clues to determine which candidate is correct. The properties of substance A1 are key. A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" into A2 and fluorine, and it \"oxidizes xenon\".\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** If Y=Sb, then A2=SbF₃ (since n=3 fits the mass perfectly). A1, which decomposes into A2 and F₂, would have to be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid at room temperature (293 K). This directly contradicts the description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\". Therefore, Y is not Antimony.\n\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** If Y=Kr, then A2=KrF₂ (for n=2). Although the mass calculation isn't perfect (calculated ɷF is ~31.2%), let's check the chemical properties.\n        *   **A1:** Decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**.\n        *   Let's check the properties of A1 = KrF₄ against the clues:\n            *   \"bright-red substance\": KrF₄ has been reported as a red solid. This is a good fit.\n            *   \"decomposes at 293 K\": KrF₄ is known to be extremely unstable, decomposing at temperatures above -100 °C (173 K). It would certainly decompose at room temperature (293 K). This is a perfect fit.\n            *   \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\": KrF₄ is an exceptionally powerful fluorinating agent, much stronger than fluorine gas, and can easily oxidize xenon. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   Conclusion: The Krypton hypothesis aligns perfectly with the chemical properties described for A1. In such problems, distinctive chemical properties are often more reliable than a single numerical value which may have a typo. We proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Substances.**\n    *   **A3:** It is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Kr), so Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. Thus, **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A5 and A4:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio: Kr + A4 → A5. A5 is a binary fluoride of krypton, most likely the more stable one, **A5 = KrF₂**. The reaction is therefore Kr + A4 → KrF₂. A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This suggests A4 is a powerful liquid fluorinating agent. An interhalogen compound fits this description. A plausible reaction with 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n        Kr + BrF₅ → KrF₂ + BrF₃\n    *   This reaction is chemically sound. Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅) is a colorless liquid and a potent fluorinating agent, strong enough to react with an inert gas. Thus, it is a very strong candidate for **A4 = BrF₅**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Having identified A4 as Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅), we can now calculate its molecular weight.\n\n    ```python\n    # Atomic mass of Bromine (Br) is 79.904 g/mol\n    # Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is 18.9984 g/mol\n    mw_brf5 = 79.904 + 5 * 18.9984\n    print(f\"{mw_brf5:.2f}\")\n    ```\n    174.90\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (BrF₅) is 174.90 g/mol. We compare this value to the given options:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 174.90 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the unknown element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the formula of compound A2 be YFₓ, where Y is the unknown element and x is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19x) = 19x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19x * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    Now, we test integer values for x to find a plausible element Y:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but the chemistry of forming five fluorides and oxidizing xenon does not fit).\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check: 83.8 / 40.45 ≈ 2.07. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony, Sb, M ≈ 121.8 g/mol). Antimony typically forms only two stable fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅, which contradicts the clue about five binary compounds.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Krypton (Y=Kr) hypothesis against the other clues.** This is the most promising candidate.\n    *   **A2**: If Y=Kr and x=2, then A2 is KrF₂ (Krypton difluoride). The theoretical mass percentage of F in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%, which is a reasonable match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride. Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) is known to be unstable and decomposes at or below room temperature (293 K) into KrF₂ and F₂. The reaction is `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. This fits perfectly. A1 is also a very strong oxidizer and would oxidize xenon, which is characteristic of higher noble gas fluorides.\n    *   **A3**: A3 is formed by fluorinating Y. `Kr + F₂ → KrF₂`. So, A3 = KrF₂. KrF₂ is a known strong oxidizer that reacts with xenon. This fits.\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is formed by reacting Y (Kr) with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. If A4 is KrF₄, the reaction is `Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂`. This is a known comproportionation reaction with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. Thus, A5 would be KrF₂. The solution of A4 (KrF₄) is described as colorless, which is correct. This set of clues strongly suggests A4 is KrF₄.\n    *   **A5 decomposition in water**: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water: `KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF`. The problem states it forms \"two substances,\" which is a minor discrepancy but acceptable in the context of a puzzle (perhaps referring to the two elemental products, Kr and O₂).\n\n    The Krypton hypothesis provides a consistent explanation for almost all the clues, especially the chemical reactions and stoichiometry.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄). We can now calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₄ = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.80 + 4 * 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.80 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this to the given options:\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol. The code output of 159.7916 confirms this calculation with higher precision.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y and Substance A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of an element Y can be calculated using the formula:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n\nUsing the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) as ~19 g/mol and the given mass fraction (0.3196):\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19 / 0.3196) - (n × 19) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n':\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (resembles Calcium or Argon, which are chemically unlikely candidates based on the other information).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr), which is 83.8 g/mol. Let's verify the mass percentage for KrF₂. Using precise atomic masses (Kr ≈ 83.8 g/mol, F ≈ 19 g/mol), the mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 2 * 19) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n\nLet's assume Y is Krypton (Kr) and A2 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).\n\n**2. Identifying Substances A1, A3, A4, and A5**\n\n*   **A1:** It is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This implies the reaction: A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. Therefore, A1 must be Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄). KrF₄ is known to be thermally unstable. One inconsistency is its color; KrF₄ is reported as a white crystalline solid, not bright-red. However, given the other fitting evidence, this might be an inaccuracy in the problem description. Importantly, A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent and would oxidize xenon, which fits the description.\n*   **A3:** This substance is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Krypton) and also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of Krypton produces KrF₂. So, A3 is KrF₂.\n*   **A4 and A5:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. Considering the known binary fluorides of Krypton (KrF₂ and KrF₄), this reaction is most plausibly the comproportionation of Krypton metal with Krypton tetrafluoride:\n    Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂\n    This reaction fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and **A5 as KrF₂**. The \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could refer to KrF₄ dissolved in a solvent like anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF).\n\n**3. Verifying the Final Clues**\n\n*   **Five binary compounds:** The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. For Krypton, only KrF₂ is well-characterized, and KrF₄ is highly unstable and its initial discovery was later disputed. However, theoretical calculations suggest other fluorides like KrF₆ could exist under specific conditions, and various ions like KrF⁺ and Kr₂F₃⁺ are known. This clue might be interpreted loosely to include these species.\n*   **Decomposition of A5 in water:** The problem states that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water to form two substances. The hydrolysis of KrF₂ is complex, but one possible interpretation is the simple decomposition into its constituent elements, which can be facilitated by water:\n    KrF₂ → Kr + F₂\n    This yields two distinct substances, Krypton gas and Fluorine gas, fitting the description.\n\n**4. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the deductions, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\nThe molecular weight is calculated as:\nM(A4) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nM(A4) ≈ 83.8 g/mol + 4 × 19.0 g/mol = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n**5. Selecting the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying an element Y and its five binary fluorides, labeled A1 through A5, based on their described chemical properties.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of the substances:\n*   **Element Y and its five binary fluorides**: The existence of five binary fluorides points towards elements with multiple oxidation states, such as actinides (like Plutonium or Uranium) or certain noble gases under specific conditions.\n*   **Substance A1**: It's a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) and oxidizes xenon. The ability to oxidize xenon points to a very powerful oxidizing agent, typical of high-valent fluorides like hexafluorides or tetrafluorides of certain elements. The decomposition at room temperature indicates it is thermally unstable.\n*   **Substance A2**: A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). This means A1 must have a higher fluorine-to-Y ratio than A2. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n*   **Substance A3**: This compound is formed by the fluorination of element Y and can also interact with xenon, suggesting it is also a strong oxidizing fluoride.\n*   **Substances A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding element Y to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a high oxidation state (A4) to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n*   **Decomposition of A5**: In water, A5 decomposes to form two other substances.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates for element Y.\n\nInitially, actinides like Plutonium (Pu) seem plausible as they form multiple fluorides. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid and a powerful oxidizing agent. It decomposes into PuF₄ and fluorine. However, if A1 is PuF₆ and A2 is PuF₄, the fluorine mass percentage of A2 (PuF₄) is about 23.75%, which does not match the given 31.96%. If we assume A2 is PuF₆ (which has ɷF ≈ 31.84%, very close to the given value), it contradicts the decomposition reaction where A1 must be a higher fluoride than A2. Furthermore, if A4 were PuF₆, its molecular weight would be approximately 358 g/mol, which does not fit any of the provided answer ranges.\n\nLet's consider another candidate: **Krypton (Kr)**. Although the existence of five stable binary fluorides of Krypton is not established (only KrF₂ and the unstable KrF₄ are known), this hypothesis resolves the other clues successfully.\n1.  **A1 and A2**: Let's test the decomposition `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. Krypton tetrafluoride (A1) is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K), decomposing into krypton difluoride (A2) and fluorine. This fits the description. While KrF₄ is often described as a white solid, some high-valence fluorides can be colored.\n2.  **Mass Percentage of A2**: The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (KrF₂) is approximately 31.2%. This value (31.2%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n3.  **Oxidizing Power**: A1 (KrF₄) and A3 (which could also be KrF₂ or KrF₄) are extremely powerful fluorinating agents and would oxidize xenon.\n4.  **A4 and A5**: The reaction of adding element Y (Kr) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to get A5 can be interpreted as the comproportionation `Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂`. In this reaction, A4 is KrF₄ and A5 is KrF₂. The reactants are indeed in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n5.  **Decomposition of A5**: The decomposition of A5 (KrF₂) in water is complex but does yield multiple products. The problem states two substances are formed, which could be a simplification.\n\nThe crucial step is to determine the molecular weight of A4. Based on our hypothesis, **A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n\nThe molecular weight of KrF₄ is calculated as:\nMW(KrF₄) = MW(Kr) + 4 * MW(F)\nMW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct molecular weight range for substance A4.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**:\n    The substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume the general formula of A2 is YFₙ. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol) and the integer n by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n    Rearranging for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol\n\n2.  **Test Plausible Candidates for Y**:\n    By testing integer values for 'n', we can find potential candidates for element Y.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 3 * 40.45 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is a very close match.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 6 * 40.45 = 242.7 g/mol. This is close to the molar mass of **Plutonium (Pu)**, which is approximately 244 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine in PuF₆ is about 31.84%, also a very close match.\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) is also reasonably close to **Iodine (I)** (M=126.9 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for IF₃ is about 31.0%.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates based on Other Clues**:\n    *   **Antimony (Sb)**: If Y is Sb, then A2 would be SbF₃. The problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This would imply A1 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid, which contradicts the description.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu)**: If Y is Pu, then A2 is PuF₆. The reaction where A5 is formed (Pu + A4 -> A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio) works perfectly if A4=PuF₆ and A5=PuF₃ (as Pu + PuF₆ → 2PuF₃). However, the molecular weight of A4 (PuF₆) is approximately 358 g/mol, which is far outside any of the given answer ranges.\n    *   **Iodine (I)**: This candidate presents the most consistent pathway, despite some discrepancies in the provided data.\n        *   **Y = Iodine (I)**. The known binary fluorides are IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇. The problem states five are known.\n        *   **A2 = IF₃**. We accept the slight inaccuracy in the fluorine mass percentage (31.0% calculated vs. 31.96% given).\n        *   **A1** is a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes to A2(IF₃) and fluorine. This would mean A1 is IF₅ or IF₇. Both are colorless, which is a major inconsistency in the problem statement. However, we proceed by prioritizing the chemical reaction logic.\n        *   **A3** is formed by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon. Direct fluorination of iodine can produce IF₅ or IF₇. IF₇ is known to react with xenon, making it a plausible candidate for A3.\n        *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is formed by adding Y (Iodine) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction where the oxidation state of iodine is averaged. Let's test the reaction with A4 = IF₅:\n          I + IF₅ → 2IF₃\n          This reaction is balanced and shows a 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants, Iodine (Y) and iodine pentafluoride (A4). The product would be A5 = IF₃.\n        *   **Decomposition of A5**: The problem states that A5 (IF₃) decomposes in water to form two substances. Iodine trifluoride is unstable and known to react with water, for instance through hydrolysis to form an iodine oxyfluoride and hydrofluoric acid (e.g., IF₃ + H₂O → IFO + 2HF). This fits the description.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    Based on the analysis, the most logical identification for A4 is iodine pentafluoride (IF₅).\n    *   Molar Mass of Iodine (I) ≈ 126.9 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of IF₅ = 126.9 + 5 * 19.0 = 221.9 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**:\n    The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nDespite the inconsistencies in the problem statement regarding the color of A1 and the precise mass fraction in A2, the chemical reactions and the resulting molecular weight for the iodine-based compounds provide a coherent solution that matches one of the options.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information about substance A2.**\n    We are given that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YF_m. The mass fraction of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is 31.96% (or 0.3196).\n    The formula for mass fraction is:\n    ωF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n    where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19 g/mol), and 'm' is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) = m * M(F) * (1/ωF - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * (3.1289 - 1)\n    M(Y) = m * 19 * 2.1289\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m\n\n2.  **Use the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * m to find possible identities for Y.**\n    We can test integer values for 'm' (the oxidation state of Y in A2) and see if the resulting M(Y) corresponds to a known element.\n    *   If m = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. (Closest element is Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   If m = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. (Close to Br, Se, Kr).\n    *   If m = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol. (Close to Sb).\n    *   If m = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. (Very close to Dysprosium, Dy, M=162.5 g/mol).\n    *   If m = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. (Close to Bi, Pb).\n    *   If m = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. (Close to Pu, Am).\n\n3.  **Analyze the information about substances A4 and A5.**\n    We are told: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    The reaction is: Y + A4 → A5. Since Y is in its elemental form (oxidation state 0) and A4 and A5 are both fluorides of Y, this is a comproportionation reaction. Let A4 = YF_n. The most straightforward interpretation of a 1:1 molar ratio leading to a single product A5 is:\n    Y(0) + Y(n+)F_n → 2 Y(n/2+)F_{n/2}\n    This means that A5 = YF_{n/2}, and importantly, the number of fluorine atoms 'n' in A4 must be an even number. A4 is also described as forming a colorless solution.\n\n4.  **Test the candidate Y = Dysprosium (Dy).**\n    From step 2, the case m=4 gave an excellent match for Dysprosium (Dy).\n    Let's test this hypothesis:\n    *   Y = Dy (M = 162.5 g/mol).\n    *   m = 162.5 / 40.45 = 4.017, which is extremely close to 4.\n    *   This suggests A2 is DyF4. Let's verify the mass fraction for DyF4:\n        M(DyF4) = 162.5 + 4 * 19 = 238.5 g/mol.\n        ωF(DyF4) = (4 * 19) / 238.5 = 76 / 238.5 = 0.3186 (or 31.86%).\n        This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that A2 = DyF4 is a very strong possibility.\n    *   Now let's find A4. According to the reaction logic in step 3, A4 must be YF_n where 'n' is an even number. Let's propose A4 = DyF4 (where n=4, which is even).\n    *   The reaction would be: Dy + DyF4 → 2 DyF2. A5 would be DyF2. This is a plausible chemical reaction.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We identified A4 as DyF4.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 = DyF4 is 238.5 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 238.5 g/mol. Let's check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 238.5 falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Although some qualitative descriptions in the problem (like the red color of A1, the oxidation of xenon, and the existence of five fluorides) conflict with the known chemistry of Dysprosium, the quantitative data points strongly and consistently to Dysprosium. The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 perfectly matches DyF4, and identifying A4 as DyF4 leads to a molecular weight that fits exactly into one of the provided answer ranges. Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the numerical data is that A4 is DyF4.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (DyF4) is 238.5 g/mol, which is in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis is a complex problem that requires careful analysis of several conflicting pieces of information. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2 is given as 31.96%. Let A2 have the formula YFₙ, where M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19)\n\n    Solving for M(Y), we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We can test integer values for *n*:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (No suitable element)\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but other properties do not match)\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No suitable element)\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Near Bismuth or Gold, but the mass fit is not as good)\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Plutonium).\n\n    The most precise numerical fit is for Y = Sb and n = 3. Therefore, **A2 is SbF₃**. The molar mass of SbF₃ is approximately 178.76 g/mol, and its fluorine percentage is 31.88%, very close to the given 31.96%.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Other Clues (and identify inconsistencies).**\n    The problem provides several chemical properties that are characteristic of very powerful fluorinating agents, such as being a \"bright-red substance\" (A1), decomposing easily (A1), and oxidizing xenon (A1 and A3). These properties do not match the chemistry of antimony fluorides (SbF₃ and SbF₅), which are white/colorless solids and are not powerful enough to oxidize xenon under normal conditions. This indicates that the problem contains deliberate red herrings, a common feature in chemistry olympiad questions, and one must rely on the most quantitative data—the mass percentage.\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine, so A1 must be a higher fluoride. The other main fluoride of antimony is **SbF₅**. So, A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and interacts with xenon. This is also **SbF₅**, which is a strong Lewis acid and can form adducts with xenon fluorides.\n    *   **A4 & A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a compound of itself in a higher oxidation state to form a product in an intermediate state.\n        Sb(0) + A4[Sb(V)] → A5[Sb(III)]\n    This means **A4 = SbF₅** and **A5 = SbF₃**. The actual balanced reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`, so the 1:1 molar ratio given in the problem is another inconsistency that must be overlooked to solve the puzzle.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 (SbF₃) decomposes in water to form two substances. Antimony trifluoride hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which fits the description.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the substance A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). We calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(A4) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F)\n    M(A4) ≈ 121.76 g/mol + 5 × 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) ≈ 121.76 + 95.00\n    M(A4) ≈ 216.76 g/mol\n\n5.  **Match the Result with the Given Ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is ~217 g/mol. Let's examine the options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value of 216.76 g/mol does not fall perfectly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range B (220-240). Such minor discrepancies in the ranges are not uncommon in complex problems of this nature. Given the logical deduction that A4 is SbF₅, this is the most plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nMy step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using Mass Percentage:** The problem states that a compound, A2, is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a fluorine weight percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)) in a compound YF_n can be derived from the weight percentage formula:\n    `Ar(Y) = (n * Ar(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF`.\n    Using Ar(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we get:\n    `Ar(Y) ≈ n * 40.35`.\n    Testing small integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms):\n    -   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.35 g/mol (close to Calcium, but chemistry doesn't fit).\n    -   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.7 g/mol (close to Bromine, but its fluorides' mass percentages don't match).\n    -   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.05 g/mol. This value is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol) and reasonably close to Iodine (I, 126.9 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Y Candidates (Iodine vs. Antimony):** The clue \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known\" is crucial. Iodine is known to form several stable binary fluorides (IF, IF3, IF5, IF7) and related species (like the dimer I2F6), fitting the description of \"five compounds\". Antimony, on the other hand, primarily forms only two stable binary fluorides (SbF3 and SbF5). Therefore, **Iodine (I)** is the most likely candidate for element Y. The slight discrepancy in the mass percentage calculation is likely due to an inaccuracy in the problem's provided value.\n\n3.  **Identify the Compounds:**\n    -   If Y is Iodine and `n=3`, then **A2 is IF3** (Iodine trifluoride).\n    -   Substance A1 decomposes to A2 (IF3) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride. By mass balance, `A1 -> IF3 + F2` implies **A1 is IF5** (Iodine pentafluoride). *Note: Some properties listed for A1, like its color and decomposition temperature, are inconsistent with pure IF5, which is a common feature in complex chemistry problems to test core chemical principles over trivia.*\n    -   The reaction described is `Y + A4 -> A5`, which is a comproportionation (the element in oxidation state 0 reacts with the same element in a higher oxidation state to form an intermediate state). This requires A4 to be a higher fluoride than A5.\n\n4.  **Determine A4 using Molecular Weight Ranges:** The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Let's calculate the molecular weights of iodine's fluorides and compare them to the given options.\n    -   MW(IF) = 126.9 + 19.0 = 145.9 g/mol -> Range A\n    -   MW(IF3) = 126.9 + 3*19.0 = 183.9 g/mol -> No range matches\n    -   MW(IF5) = 126.9 + 5*19.0 = 221.9 g/mol -> Range D\n    -   MW(IF7) = 126.9 + 7*19.0 = 259.9 g/mol -> No range matches\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:** Based on the options, A4 is either IF or IF5. The reaction is `I + A4 -> A5`. For a comproportionation to occur, we add the element to a higher-valent compound. Therefore, A4 must be the higher fluoride, **IF5**. The product, A5, would be a lower fluoride like IF3. The molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is 221.9 g/mol, which falls perfectly within range D.\n\n```python\n# Atomic weight of Iodine (I)\nAr_I = 126.9\n# Atomic weight of Fluorine (F)\nAr_F = 19.0\n\n# Based on the reasoning, element Y is Iodine and substance A4 is Iodine Pentafluoride (IF5).\n# Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4 (IF5).\nnum_fluorine_atoms = 5\nmolecular_weight_A4 = Ar_I + num_fluorine_atoms * Ar_F\n\nprint(f\"The element Y is identified as Iodine (I).\")\nprint(f\"Substance A4 is identified as Iodine Pentafluoride (IF5).\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is {molecular_weight_A4:.1f} g/mol.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given ranges:\")\nprint(\"A) 140-160\")\nprint(\"B) 160-180\")\nprint(\"C) 110-130\")\nprint(\"D) 220-240\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated molecular weight of {molecular_weight_A4:.1f} g/mol falls into range D.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: D\")\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The element Y is identified as Iodine (I).\nSubstance A4 is identified as Iodine Pentafluoride (IF5).\nThe molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is 221.9 g/mol.\n\nComparing this to the given ranges:\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls into range D.\n\nFinal Answer Choice: D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe first crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approx. 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca, or Scandium, Sc).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br, or Selenium, Se).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy).\n*   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Lead, Pb, or Bismuth, Bi).\n\nLet's verify the fluorine percentage for A2 being SbF3:\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis is very close to the given 31.96% (a difference of only 0.25%), making it the most likely candidate.\nThus, **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound A3**\n\nThe problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine (Sb + F2 -> A3) and that A3 can interact with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) is formed by direct fluorination of antimony and is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon (typically by forming adducts with xenon fluorides, e.g., XeF2·SbF5).\nTherefore, **A3 is SbF5**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction to find A4 and A5**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in this clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This can be written as:\nSb + A4 --(1:1 molar ratio)--> A5\n\nThis is a comproportionation reaction, where antimony in oxidation state 0 (elemental Sb) reacts with antimony in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form antimony in an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n\nThe next clue is: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\nLet's check the hydrolysis of antimony fluorides:\n*   SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF (two products: antimony(III) oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride).\n*   SbF5 + 2H2O → SbO2F + 4HF (two products: antimony(V) oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride).\nBoth SbF3 and SbF5 fit this description. However, since A5 is the product of a comproportionation starting with Sb(0) and a higher oxidation state, A5 must have a lower oxidation state than A4. The most stable lower oxidation state fluoride is SbF3. Let's assume **A5 = SbF3**.\n\nNow, let's substitute A5=SbF3 back into the reaction equation:\nSb + A4 --(1:1 molar ratio)--> SbF3\n\nLet A4 be SbF_x. The balanced chemical equation for the comproportionation would be:\n`a Sb + b SbFx → c SbF3`\nTo satisfy the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants, we must have a = b. Let's set a=1 and b=1.\n`1 Sb(0) + 1 Sb(+x)Fx → c Sb(+3)F3`\nConservation of Sb atoms: 1 + 1 = c => c = 2.\nThe reaction is `Sb + SbFx → 2 SbF3`.\nConservation of F atoms: x = 2 * 3 => x = 6.\n\nSo, the reaction is: **Sb + SbF6 → 2 SbF3**.\nThis reaction is perfectly balanced with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This means that **A4 must be SbF6**. Although SbF6 is not a common stable compound (unlike the [SbF6]⁻ anion), its existence is implied by the logic of the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Find the Correct Range**\n\nNow we calculate the molecular weight (M) of A4, which we identified as SbF6.\nM(SbF6) = M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\nM(SbF6) = 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 114 = 235.76 g/mol.\n\nFinally, we check which of the given ranges contains this value:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight, 235.76 g/mol, falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n**Final Check:** The remaining clues about A1 (\"bright-red\", decomposes to SbF3 and F2, oxidizes Xe) are complex and point to a highly unstable/exotic species. However, identifying A1 is not necessary to determine A4. The logic derived from A2, A3, A4, and A5 is self-consistent and leads to a unique answer among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nBased on the reasoning and the output from the code execution, the conclusion is as follows:\n\n1.  The mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2 (31.96%) was used to identify element Y as Antimony (Sb) and compound A2 as Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃).\n2.  The question asks for the molecular weight range of compound A4, which must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony.\n3.  The molecular weights of the two most common antimony fluorides were calculated:\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF₃ = 178.76 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of SbF₅ = 216.76 g/mol\n4.  Comparing these values to the given options:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 160-180\n5.  Only the molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits into one of the provided ranges (Option D). The molecular weight of SbF₅ does not fit into any of the ranges.\n6.  Therefore, substance A4 must be SbF₃.\n\nThe correct range for the molecular weight of A4 is 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2\n\nThe first crucial piece of information is that substance A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F)) * 100%\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n*   M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y\n*   n is an integer representing the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nWe are given ɷF = 31.96%, so we can write:\n0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n\nRearranging for M(Y):\nM(Y) * 0.3196 + 19.00 * n * 0.3196 = 19.00 * n\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = 19.00 * n * (1 - 0.3196)\nM(Y) * 0.3196 = 19.00 * n * 0.6804\nM(Y) = (19.00 * 0.6804 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible atomic mass for an element Y known to form multiple fluorides:\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but Ca chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, but the mass percentages for bromine fluorides do not match).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n*   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Terbium/Dysprosium, but their chemistry is less likely to fit the subsequent clues).\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for Antimony trifluoride (SbF3):\nM(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00 / 178.76) * 100% ≈ 31.88%\n\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96%. Therefore, we can confidently identify:\n*   Element Y is **Antimony (Sb)**.\n*   Substance A2 is **Antimony trifluoride (SbF3)**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Other Compounds and Reactions\n\n*   **A3:** It's obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) and it interacts with Xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields SbF3 or SbF5, and SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid known to react with xenon compounds. Thus, **A3 is SbF5**.\n*   **A1:** It decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, likely SbF5. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) does not perfectly match pure SbF5 (a colorless liquid), suggesting it might be an unstable polymorph or impure form, but its chemical role as a higher fluoride is clear.\n*   **A5:** It decomposes in water to form two substances. This is characteristic of a mixed-valence compound, which upon hydrolysis would yield compounds of antimony in two different oxidation states (e.g., Sb(III) and Sb(V)).\n*   **A4:** The reaction is \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This is a comproportionation reaction where Sb(0) reduces a higher oxidation state antimony compound (A4) to form the mixed-valence compound A5. This implies A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state, such as Sb(V). Therefore, A4 should be SbF5 or a mixed-valence fluoride.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nHere we face a contradiction between chemical principles and the provided options:\n1.  **Chemical approach:** A4 must be an oxidizing agent for Sb(0), so it cannot be SbF3. A4 is likely SbF5. The molecular weight of SbF5 is 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**. This value does not fit well into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A (220-240) but lies outside of it.\n2.  **Numerical approach:** Let's examine the molecular weights of the possible antimony fluorides in relation to the options.\n    *   M(SbF3) = **178.76 g/mol**. This value falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n    *   M(SbF5) = **216.76 g/mol**. This does not fall within any range.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that the molecular weight of one of the key compounds matches one of the options exactly. The molecular weight of SbF3 (which we identified as A2) is a perfect fit for range C.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that A4 is the same substance as A2, namely SbF3. This creates a chemical puzzle with the reaction `Sb + SbF3 -> A5`, which is not a standard reaction. However, in the context of such problems, a numerical match this precise is a very strong indicator. It is more likely that the description of the reaction is either flawed or refers to an obscure chemical process than that the numerical data (mass percentage) and the options are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that A4 is SbF3 based on its molecular weight.\n\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   This value is in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range **160-180**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  **Identification of Element Y and A2**: Based on the information that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%, we can determine the identity of element Y. By calculating the expected atomic mass of Y for a formula YF_n, the best fit is achieved when n=3, yielding a mass very close to that of Antimony (Sb). Therefore, element Y is Antimony, and A2 is Antimony trifluoride, SbF3.\n2.  **Molecular Weight of A2 (SbF3)**: The molecular weight of SbF3 is calculated as the sum of the atomic masses of Antimony (≈121.76 g/mol) and three Fluorine atoms (3 * 19.00 g/mol), which equals approximately **178.76 g/mol**.\n3.  **Determining A4**: The question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. We are given several clues about the compounds. A3 is formed by fluorinating antimony and reacts with xenon, which strongly points to A3 being antimony pentafluoride (SbF5). The reaction to form A5 (`Y + A4 -> A5`) involves reducing an antimony fluoride (A4) with elemental antimony (Y), implying A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state (like SbF5). However, the molecular weight of SbF5 (≈216.76 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n4.  **Conclusion on A4's Molecular Weight**: We observe that the calculated molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**. In puzzle-like chemistry problems, such a direct numerical correspondence is a very strong clue. It is most probable that A4 is the same compound as A2 (SbF3), despite the apparent chemical contradiction in the reaction description, which may be flawed or refer to an obscure process. Based on the compelling numerical evidence, A4 is identified as SbF3.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which falls into the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The key information is that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for a binary fluoride is YF_n.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F), where M_Y is the molar mass of element Y and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    Rearranging for M_Y: M_Y = (n * M_F / ɷF) - (n * M_F) = n * M_F * (1/ɷF - 1).\n    Plugging in the values: M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1/0.3196 - 1) = n * 19.00 * (3.129 - 1) = n * 40.45.\n    We can now test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, which doesn't fit the other clues).\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the actual mass percentage for KrF₂: ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol). The mass percentage for SbF₃ is ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 57.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is an even better match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates Y=Kr and Y=Sb using other clues:**\n    *   **Clue:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"\n    *   If Y = Sb, A2 would be SbF₃. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride, i.e., SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless, stable liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. Also, while SbF₅ is a strong Lewis acid, its ability to oxidize Xenon under normal conditions is not its most defining characteristic in the way it is for other compounds. This path seems unlikely.\n    *   If Y = Kr, A2 would be KrF₂. A1 would be a higher fluoride, KrF₄.\n        *   **Decomposition:** KrF₄ is known to be extremely unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature (293 K) into KrF₂ and F₂. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   **Oxidizing Power:** Krypton compounds are exceptionally powerful oxidizing agents. KrF₂ itself can oxidize xenon. The KrF⁺ cation, which could be formed from KrF₂, is one of the strongest known oxidizers and readily oxidizes xenon. A higher fluoride like KrF₄ would therefore certainly oxidize xenon. This fits.\n        *   **Color:** The only inconsistency is the color. KrF₄ is described as a white solid, not \"bright-red\". Given that all other chemical properties strongly point to Krypton, the color description in the problem is likely an error.\n\n3.  **Confirm Identity of A3:**\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"\n    *   Fluorination of Krypton produces Krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is known to react with (oxidize) xenon. So, A3 = KrF₂. This is consistent with our assignment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Compounds and Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   So far, we have identified Y = Krypton, A1 = KrF₄, and A2 = A3 = KrF₂.\n    *   Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n        *   M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   M(KrF₄) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. The remaining clues describe a reaction involving A4 to produce A5. This reaction (\"adding Y...to...solution of A4\") seems chemically implausible as written and may be a red herring.\n    *   However, the question presents four molecular weight ranges, two of which correspond perfectly to the compounds we have identified:\n        *   **A) 110-130:** Contains M(KrF₂) = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   **D) 140-160:** Contains M(KrF₄) = 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   The problem introduces A1 and A4 as distinct entities in the narrative. A1 is defined by its decomposition. A4 is defined as a reactant in a solution. Since A1 has been identified as KrF₄, it is logical to assume that A4 is the other major fluoride of krypton, which is KrF₂.\n\nTherefore, A4 is KrF₂, and its molecular weight is ~121.8 g/mol, which falls into the range 110-130.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage of A2.**\n    Let the formula of substance A2 be YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    We are given ɷF = 31.96% (or 0.3196) and the molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M(Y), the molar mass of element Y, we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n    We can test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca or Sc, which do not form five fluorides).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, but its fluorides don't match other clues).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Iodine (I)**, which is 126.9 g/mol. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Au, M=197.0 g/mol). This is another possibility.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (similar to Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Iodine (Y=I) Hypothesis.**\n    If Y is Iodine and n=3, then substance **A2 is IF₃** (Iodine trifluoride). Iodine is known to form several binary fluorides, including IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇. The existence of five compounds as stated in the problem is plausible if dimers or unstable species are included.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A1.**\n    The problem states that the bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine gas (F₂). This decomposition (A1 → IF₃ + F₂) implies A1 is a higher fluoride of iodine.\n    Let's test A1 = IF₅. The reaction would be IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂. This is a chemically sound decomposition.\n    The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is inconsistent with pure IF₅, which is a colorless liquid. This is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as the other chemical clues for the Iodine path are consistent. A1 being a strong oxidizer that reacts with xenon is also true for iodine fluorides.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    The crucial clue is: \"By adding Y (Iodine) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   **A4**: The solution of A4 is colorless. Of the known iodine fluorides, IF₅ and IF₇ are colorless, while IF₃ is yellow and IF is unstable. Therefore, A4 is likely IF₅ or IF₇.\n    *   **The Reaction**: Y + A4 → A5 is a comproportionation reaction, where iodine in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with an iodine fluoride of a higher oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = IF₅**. The reaction with iodine (Y) is:\n        I + IF₅ → 2IF₃\n    This reaction is balanced and proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio of I atoms to IF₅ molecules. The product formed is IF₃.\n    *   **A5**: The product of the reaction is **A5 = IF₃**.\n    *   **Final Check**: The problem states A5 decomposes in water. IF₃ reacts vigorously with water to form hydrofluoric acid and iodic acid, fitting the description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅).\n    Molecular Weight (MW) of IF₅ = M(I) + 5 × M(F)\n    MW(IF₅) = 126.9 g/mol + 5 × 19.0 g/mol\n    MW(IF₅) = 126.9 + 95.0\n    MW(IF₅) = 221.9 g/mol\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identifying Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    *   We are given that compound A2 is a fluoride of element Y (YFₓ) and contains 31.96% fluorine by mass.\n    *   Using the formula for mass percentage, `Molar Mass of Y ≈ 40.45 * x`, where x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    *   Testing integer values for x, we find that for x=6, the molar mass of Y is approximately 242.7 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Americium (Am, 243 g/mol). Actinides like americium are known to form multiple fluorides.\n    *   Let's verify: The molecular weight of AmF₆ is 243 + 6*(19) = 357 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (6*19)/357 ≈ 31.93%, which confirms our identification.\n    *   So, **Element Y is Americium (Am)** and **A2 is Americium hexafluoride (AmF₆)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Compounds A1 and A3:**\n    *   **A1** decomposes into A2 (AmF₆) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher, less stable fluoride, such as AmF₇. As a higher fluoride, it would be a very powerful oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing xenon, which matches the description.\n    *   **A3** is formed by fluorinating americium and also oxidizes xenon. This is consistent with A3 also being a high-oxidation-state fluoride, most likely **AmF₆**.\n\n3.  **Identifying Compounds A4 and A5:**\n    *   **A5** is obtained by reacting element Y (Am) with a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Solutions of americium compounds are typically colored. Therefore, A4 is likely the reagent dissolved in a colorless solvent (like anhydrous HF), not an americium compound itself.\n    *   A \"colorless\" powerful fluorinating agent that reacts 1:1 with a metal suggests a noble gas fluoride. **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) fits this description perfectly.** It is a colorless solid that forms a powerful fluorinating solution.\n    *   The reaction is: Am + KrF₂ → AmF₂ + Kr. This reaction proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Therefore, **A4 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) and A5 is Americium(II) fluoride (AmF₂)**.\n    *   The description that A5 (AmF₂) decomposes in water into two substances is also consistent, as the Am²⁺ ion is unstable in aqueous solution and would disproportionate into Am³⁺ and Am⁰.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   We have identified A4 as Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).\n    *   Molecular Weight of Kr = ~83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of F = ~19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of KrF₂ = 83.80 + 2 * (19.00) = 121.80 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of substance A4 is 121.80 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 110-130.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196, and the atomic mass of fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the atomic mass of element Y (Ar(Y)):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n × 19.00)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) + 0.3196 × (19.00n) = 19.00n\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 19.00n × (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 × Ar(Y) = 19.00n × 0.6804\nAr(Y) = n × (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nAr(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe can now test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for Y.\n*   n=1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, Ar = 40.08 g/mol)\n*   n=2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, Ar = 79.90 g/mol)\n*   n=3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to Antimony, Ar = 121.76 g/mol)\n*   n=4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (This is close to Dysprosium, Ar = 162.50 g/mol)\n\nThe code output from the initial reasoning confirms that Antimony (Sb) is an excellent candidate for Y, with n=3.\nFor Y=Sb and n=3, the compound is SbF3.\nLet's verify the fluorine percentage in SbF3:\nMW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol\n%F = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 × 100% = 57 / 178.76 × 100% ≈ 31.88%\nThis value (31.88%) is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is likely Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF3**.\n\n**Step 2: Use the other clues to identify the compounds.**\n*   **Y = Sb**\n*   **A2 = SbF3**\n*   **A3** is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb). Direct fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride, SbF5. So, **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A3 (SbF5)** can interact with xenon. SbF5 is a powerful Lewis acid and is known to form adducts with xenon fluorides, so this is consistent.\n*   **A5** decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF3 hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). `SbF3(s) + H2O(l) → SbOF(s) + 2HF(aq)`. This fits the description. Thus, it is highly likely that **A5 = SbF3**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the identity and molecular weight of A4.**\nWe have deduced that A2 and A5 are both SbF3. The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. The clues may be convoluted, but let's consider the most straightforward possibility. In chemistry problems of this type, a substance may appear multiple times under different labels (A2, A4, A5). Let's test the hypothesis that A4 is also SbF3.\n\nIf A4 = SbF3, we can calculate its molecular weight:\nMolecular Weight (MW) of SbF3 = Ar(Sb) + 3 × Ar(F)\nMW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n\nNow, let's check which of the given ranges this value falls into:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol fits perfectly into the range **160-180**.\n\nWhile some descriptive clues in the problem (like the properties of A1 and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) seem contradictory with standard antimony chemistry, the quantitative data provides a clear path. The mass percentage strongly points to SbF3, and the molecular weight of SbF3 aligns perfectly with one of the answer choices. This is the most logical and consistent solution.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the properties of Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The general formula for this compound is YFₓ.\n    The formula for the mass percentage of an element in a compound is:\n    ωF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    where M(F) is the atomic mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n    We are given ωF = 0.3196. So, we can write:\n    0.3196 = (19.00 * x) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19.00 * x) = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * x = 19.00 * x\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We now test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y, to find a corresponding element with a plausible atomic mass:\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca, 40.08) or Argon (Ar, 39.95). Neither is likely to form the compounds described.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.90). While Br forms fluorides, the properties do not perfectly align with the rest of the problem.\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This value is exceptionally close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Antimony is a well-known element that forms multiple fluorides.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol. This is close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.50). This is a rare-earth element and less likely to be the subject of such a problem.\n\n    Let's confirm with Y = Sb and x = 3. The substance A2 would be SbF₃.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ is (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A3.**\n    A3 is formed by the fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it can react with xenon. The direct reaction of antimony with excess fluorine gas produces antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅.\n    Sb + (5/2)F₂ → SbF₅\n    SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is famous for reacting with xenon compounds (like XeF₂) to form salts. This confirms that **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    This is the central part of the question. The clues for A4 are:\n    *   It's a component of a \"hot colorless concentrated solution.\"\n    *   It reacts with elemental antimony (Y = Sb). This is a redox reaction where Sb(0) is oxidized. Therefore, A4 must contain an oxidizing agent.\n    *   This implies A4 must contain antimony in its higher oxidation state, Sb(V).\n\n    Let's examine the options for the molecular weight of A4, assuming it is a compound containing Sb(V):\n    *   The simplest Sb(V) fluoride is SbF₅. Its molecular weight is 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value is not in any of the provided ranges.\n    *   The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" containing an Sb(V) species strongly suggests the presence of a superacid. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) reacts with hydrogen fluoride (HF) to form **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**, one of the strongest known acids. It exists as a colorless liquid, fitting the description.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of HSbF₆:\n        M(HSbF₆) = M(H) + M(Sb) + 6 * M(F)\n        M(HSbF₆) ≈ 1.01 + 121.76 + 6 * 19.00 = 236.77 g/mol.\n\n    This calculated molecular weight of **236.77 g/mol** falls perfectly within the range **D) 220-240**. The presence of Sb(V) in HSbF₆ makes it a powerful oxidant capable of reacting with elemental antimony. Thus, all clues point to A4 being HSbF₆.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFx, where x is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of A2 is M(Y) + x * M(F).\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the molar mass of element Y, M(Y):\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)  (Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * x\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * x\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe need to find an integer `x` and a corresponding element Y that has a molar mass close to the calculated M(Y). We can test integer values for x:\n*   x=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca or Sc)\n*   x=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br or Se)\n*   x=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb)\n*   x=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy)\n*   x=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg or Bi)\n*   x=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu or Am)\n\nTo determine the correct element, we use the other clues.\n\"A1 is a bright-red substance... decomposes at 293 K... oxidizes xenon.\"\nThis points to a very reactive, high-oxidation-state fluoride of a heavy element. The actinides, like plutonium (Pu), are known for such compounds. Let's test Y = Pu (M ≈ 244 g/mol).\nIf M(Y) = 244, then 244 ≈ 40.45 * x, which gives x ≈ 6.03. This is very close to x=6.\nSo, let's hypothesize that **A2 is PuF6**.\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for PuF6: M(Pu) = 244 g/mol, M(F) = 19 g/mol.\nɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 = 0.3184 or 31.84%.\nThis is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only about 0.4%. This is a very strong match.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compounds A1, A3, A4, and A5 using Plutonium Chemistry**\n\n*   **Compound A1**: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine.\"\n    The reaction is A1 -> PuF6 + F2.\n    For this to be balanced, A1 must be a higher fluoride of plutonium, such as PuF8. However, PuF8 is unknown and extremely unlikely to exist. This indicates a contradiction. Let's re-read carefully. Perhaps the roles of A1 and A2 are reversed from our initial assumption based on the properties.\n\n*   Let's re-evaluate based on chemical properties.\n    *   **PuF6** is described as a volatile, reddish-brown solid. This fits \"bright-red substance\".\n    *   **PuF6** is unstable at room temperature (293 K) and decomposes.\n    *   The decomposition of PuF6 is: **PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2**.\n    *   **PuF6** is a very powerful fluorinating agent and can oxidize xenon.\n\n    This means **A1 must be PuF6**.\n    The decomposition reaction is A1 -> A2 + F2, which translates to **PuF6 -> PuF4 + F2**.\n    Therefore, **A2 must be PuF4**.\n\n    Now, we must address the mass percentage discrepancy. The problem states ɷF for A2 is 31.96%. We calculated that for **PuF6**, not PuF4.\n    ɷF(PuF4) = (4 * 19) / (244 + 4*19) = 76 / 320 = 23.75%.\n    This is a significant contradiction. It appears there is an error in the problem statement itself, where the mass percentage given (31.96%) actually corresponds to substance A1 (PuF6), not A2 (PuF4). Given that all other chemical descriptions for Pu chemistry fit perfectly, we proceed by assuming this error in the problem's text.\n\n*   **Summary of corrected identification:**\n    *   Y = Plutonium (Pu)\n    *   A1 = PuF6 (reddish-brown, decomposes at RT, oxidizes Xe)\n    *   A2 = PuF4 (product of A1 decomposition)\n\n*   **Compound A3**: \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"\n    The reaction is Pu + nF2 -> A3. PuF6 (A1) is a strong oxidizer. PuF4 (A2) is much more stable. PuF6 is made by fluorinating PuF4 at high temperatures, which is in turn made by fluorinating Pu. Direct fluorination of Pu can also yield PuF6. So, it is plausible that **A3 is PuF6** (same as A1).\n\n*   **Compounds A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" \"In water, A5 decomposes...\"\n    The reaction is Y + A4 -> A5, so **Pu + A4 -> A5**.\n    The five known binary fluorides of Plutonium are PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, and PuF6 (with PuF5 being unstable). PuF3 is the most reduced common fluoride.\n    This reaction (adding the metal Y to one of its fluorides A4) is a synproportionation reaction, where the metal reduces the fluoride to a lower oxidation state.\n    Let's test the possibilities for A4, which must be a stable fluoride higher than A5. A4 solution is also \"colorless\". Pu(III) salts are violet, Pu(IV) are brown/green, Pu(V) are pink, Pu(VI) are pink/orange. However, these are for aqueous solutions. In a non-aqueous solvent like anhydrous HF, fluoride complexes can have different colors. UF4 (analogous to PuF4) is green but can form colorless complexes. Let's assume a plausible reaction from known plutonium chemistry.\n    A well-known synproportionation is the reaction of plutonium metal with plutonium tetrafluoride to produce plutonium trifluoride:\n    **Pu + 3 PuF4 -> 4 PuF3**\n    The problem states a 1:1 molar ratio, not 1:3. Let's check another reaction:\n    **Pu + PuF6 -> 2 PuF4** (This is not 1:1 forming a single product A5)\n    The most likely intended reaction fitting the 1:1 stoichiometry for producing a single product is:\n    **Pu + 2PuF3 -> 3PuF2** (not 1:1)\n    However, the reaction between Pu and PuF4 to make PuF3 is fundamental. Perhaps the stoichiometry in the problem is simplified. Let's assume the most common species are involved. A reaction where a higher fluoride is reduced by the metal.\n    The most logical choice for this process is the reduction of PuF4 (A4) to PuF3 (A5).\n    So, let's identify:\n    *   **A4 = PuF4**\n    *   **A5 = PuF3**\n    The reaction is Pu + 3PuF4 → 4PuF3. While not 1:1, it's a known reaction to produce A5 from A4 and Y. Let's assume the problem's stoichiometry is a simplification and the chemical identity is key.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deductions, substance A4 is Plutonium Tetrafluoride (PuF4).\nWe calculate its molecular weight:\nM(PuF4) = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nM(PuF4) = 244 g/mol + 4 * 19 g/mol\nM(PuF4) = 244 + 76\nM(PuF4) = 320 g/mol\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.\nA) 160-180\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nOur calculated molecular weight is 320 g/mol. None of the given ranges contain this value. This indicates a potential second error in the problem, either in the options provided or in our identification.\n\nLet's re-examine the last reaction step.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio)\nPu + A4 -> A5\nIf A4 were PuF6, then Pu + PuF6 -> 2PuFx. No single product.\nIf A4 were PuF3, what would it react with Pu to form? A lower fluoride? PuF2 is not a stable bulk compound.\nThis part of the problem is puzzling. Let's reconsider the whole chain.\n\nIs there any other element that fits? We found no other element that fits the mass percentage of A2 and the chemical properties of A1 as well as Plutonium. The logical contradiction must lie within the problem's statements.\n\nLet's assume our identification of **Y=Pu** and **A1=PuF6 -> A2=PuF4** is correct based on the strongest clues (color, reactivity, decomposition), and that the mass % for A2 was a typo for A1. This is the most consistent path.\n\nThis leaves the final reaction step and the final answer.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nPu + A4 -> A5\nLet's consider that the problem might be from a specific educational context where certain facts are canonical, even if unusual.\nWhat if A4 is not PuF4? Let's reconsider.\nA1=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A3=PuF6, A5=PuF3. What is A4?\n\"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 must be one of the 5 binary fluorides. Let's assume they are PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6 and some other.\nIf A4=PuF6, Pu + PuF6 -> 2 PuF4. This is a possibility if A5 is PuF4, but A2 is already PuF4.\nIf the five compounds are A1-A5, and A1=A3=PuF6, A2=PuF4, A5=PuF3. Then A4 is the only one left.\nBut we don't know the fifth fluoride.\n\nLet's rethink A4 -> A5 from a different angle.\nWhat if Y=Sb?\nA2=SbF3 (ɷF=31.88%). A1->SbF3+F2, so A1=SbF5. But SbF5 is not red. This path fails early.\n\nLet's stick with Pu being the most likely element despite the contradictions. The error seems to be in the problem's data (mass%, stoichiometry, or final options). Let's search for the molecular weight of any of the identified Pu fluorides in the options.\nM(PuF6) = 358 g/mol\nM(PuF4) = 320 g/mol\nM(PuF3) = 301 g/mol\nNone of these fit in any range.\n\nThere must be another interpretation. Let's go back to the list of candidates from the mass percentage of A2.\nA2 = AuF5 (ɷF=32.53%)? Y=Au. A1=AuF7? No. A1 could be the red dimer [AuF5]2. But it decomposes to monomeric AuF5, not A2+F2. This path is weak.\nA2 = UF6 (ɷF=32.38%)? Y=U. A1 would be UFx (>6), which doesn't exist. This path is weak.\n\nLet's reconsider the decomposition A1 -> A2 + F2 and the red color. This combination is rare. Besides PuF6, KrF4 is a possibility. Let's assume Y=Kr.\nA2 = KrF2 (ɷF=31.2%). This is a bit far from 31.96%.\nIf A2=KrF2, then A1=KrF4. A1 is reddish and decomposes to A2+F2. This fits. A1 and A3 (KrF2?) oxidize Xe. Fits.\nNow the final step: Y + A4 -> A5.\nKr + A4 -> A5.\nKrypton, a noble gas, reacting with one of its own fluorides in a synproportionation reaction is extremely unlikely. This path fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem entirely. What if the description of A1 being \"bright-red\" is the key?\nRed binary fluorides: Au2F10, V F5, PuF6, NpF6.\nThe most likely scenario remains an error in the problem. However, a choice must be made. Let's assume there is a non-obvious element that fits. Let's re-examine the M(Y) list.\n\nx=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8. Element Dy (162.5). Could A2=DyF4? Dy is a lanthanide, typically forming +3 ions. DyF4 exists but is not common. Let's calculate ɷF(DyF4) = (4*19)/(162.5 + 76) = 76 / 238.5 = 31.86%. This is an excellent match to 31.96%!\nSo let's proceed with Y=Dy and A2=DyF4.\n*   Y = Dysprosium (Dy)\n*   A2 = DyF4 (ɷF=31.86%)\n*   A1: Decomposes to A2 + F2. So A1 = DyF5? Not known. Is DyF4 \"bright-red\"? No available information suggests this. Can it oxidize Xe? Highly unlikely for a lanthanide fluoride. This path fails on the chemical properties.\n\nLet's take a step back and assume there's a simple answer we missed, likely due to a faulty premise. The Pu hypothesis is chemically the most sound, but leads to a numeric mismatch with the options. If we are forced to choose an answer, there must be a flaw in our identification of A4.\nPu + A4 -> A5.\nMaybe A4 isn't a simple fluoride, but a complex in solution? No, \"binary compounds\".\nWhat if A4 is from a completely different element system? No, it's one of the five fluorides of Y.\n\nLet's assume the molecular weight of *one of the compounds* A1-A5 must fit an answer.\nA1=PuF6 (358)\nA2=PuF4 (320)\nA3=PuF6 (358)\nA4=?\nA5=PuF3 (301)\nNone fit. This indicates Y is not Pu, or the options are for another element.\n\nLet's reconsider Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. ɷF=31.88% (excellent fit).\nA1 -> SbF3 + F2. Thus A1=SbF5. But SbF5 is colorless, not red. This is a fatal flaw.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. Sb + A4 -> A5. A4=SbF5, A5=SbF3.\n2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. This is a known reaction. A4=SbF5, A5=SbF3.\nSo we have:\nY=Sb\nA1=SbF5 (color mismatch)\nA2=SbF3\nA3=SbF5 (obtained by F2 on Sb, oxidizes Xe through formation of adducts like [XeF]+[Sb2F11]-)\nA4=SbF5\nA5=SbF3\nThe only inconsistency is the color of A1. If we ignore that one word, everything else fits. What is the molecular weight of A4?\nA4 = SbF5.\nM(SbF5) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95 = 216.76 g/mol.\nThis value does not fit in any of the ranges.\n\nThere is a fundamental inconsistency in the problem statement as written. No single element satisfies all conditions simultaneously. However, in such cases, one must find the 'least wrong' answer.\nThe match between A2 and DyF4 on mass % is nearly perfect. Let's revisit that.\nY=Dy, A2=DyF4. Let's assume the other chemical facts are \"bent\" to fit.\nWhat would A4 be? Dysprosium chemistry is dominated by DyF3. The reduction of DyF4 by Dy metal would produce DyF3.\nSo, A4=DyF4, A5=DyF3.\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. A4 = DyF4.\nMW(DyF4) = 162.5 + 4*19 = 162.5 + 76 = 238.5 g/mol.\nThis falls in the range D) 220-240.\nLet's check if this path is plausible.\nA1->DyF4+F2 implies A1=DyF5 (hypothetical). Assume it's red and oxidizes Xe.\nA3 also oxidizes Xe. A3=DyF4? Unlikely.\nY + A4 -> A5 (1:1). Dy + DyF4 -> DyF3? No, Dy + 3DyF4 -> 4DyF3.\nThis path is also full of holes.\n\nLet's return to the most plausible chemical story (Pu) and assume the options are wrong.\nLet's assume the identification of A4 is wrong, but Y is still Pu. Could A4 be something else with MW in a given range?\nRange D is 220-240. PuFx cannot have this MW.\nLet's assume Y is wrong, and work backwards from the answer.\nIf answer D is correct, MW(A4) is between 220-240. We found MW(DyF4)=238.5. This is the only candidate whose fluoride (A4) fits an answer range, and whose *other* fluoride (A2) perfectly matches the given mass percent. The problem's author likely constructed it around Dy, even though the chemical properties (red color, Xe oxidation) are unrealistic for Dysprosium and were probably borrowed from other elements to make the problem more challenging. Therefore, the intended answer path is likely:\n1. Use ɷF = 31.96% to find A2. This leads to M(Y)≈40.45x. For x=4, M(Y)≈161.8, which points to Dy. ɷF(DyF4)=31.86%, a near-perfect match. So A2=DyF4.\n2. The reaction Y+A4->A5 is a reduction of a higher fluoride by the metal. The common fluorides are DyF3 and DyF4. This suggests A4=DyF4 being reduced to A5=DyF3.\n3. The question asks for MW of A4. Calculate MW(DyF4). MW = 162.5 + 4*19 = 238.5 g/mol.\n4. This value falls into the range 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct substance and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of A2**: The substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the formula YFₓ, where Y is the element and x is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. The formula for mass percentage is:\n\n    ɷF = (x * Atomic Mass of F) / (Atomic Mass of Y + x * Atomic Mass of F)\n\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\n    Solving for M(Y), we get: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x.\n\n    We can test integer values for x, which represents the oxidation state of Y:\n    *   If x=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium).\n    *   If x=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (similar to Bromine).\n    *   If x=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol) and Iodine (I, 126.90 g/mol).\n    *   If x=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol.\n    *   If x=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n\n    Let's check the mass percentages for the most likely candidates:\n    *   For **SbF₃**: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   For **IF₃**: ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (126.90 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 183.90 ≈ 30.99%. This is a less accurate match.\n\n    The excellent match for Antimony suggests **Y is likely Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Other Clues with Y = Sb**:\n    *   **A3 from Y + F₂**: The fluorination of antimony with fluorine produces antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   **A3 oxidizes xenon**: Antimony pentafluoride is a very strong Lewis acid and oxidizing agent known to react with xenon. This fits.\n    *   **The Reaction to form A5**: The problem states that adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 ratio yields A5. The most plausible reaction involving elemental antimony and an antimony fluoride is the comproportionation: `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. In this reaction, A4 would be SbF₅ and A5 would be SbF₃. While the problem states a 1:1 molar ratio which contradicts this balanced equation, it's common in such problems for stoichiometry to be simplified or stated incorrectly. The chemical transformation itself is sound.\n    *   **A4 is a colorless solution**: Antimony pentafluoride is a colorless, viscous liquid that can form a solution.\n    *   **A5 decomposition in water**: A5 (identified as SbF₃) hydrolyzes in water to form antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), which are two different substances. This also fits.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the analysis, A4 is identified as antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Now, we calculate its molecular weight:\n    *   Molecular Weight (SbF₅) = Atomic Mass of Sb + 5 * Atomic Mass of F\n    *   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Consider the Iodine (I) Alternative and the Options**: If we assume Y is Iodine, then A4 would likely be IF₅.\n    *   Molecular Weight (IF₅) = 126.90 + 5 * 18.998 = 221.89 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls perfectly into the range **A) 220-240**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: There is a conflict between the clues. The mass percentage strongly points to Antimony (Y=Sb), but the resulting molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅, 216.75 g/mol) does not fit any of the provided ranges neatly. The Iodine hypothesis (Y=I) has a less perfect mass percentage match but results in a molecular weight for A4 (IF₅, 221.89 g/mol) that fits perfectly into range A. In chemical problems of this nature, a perfect fit into a given numerical range is often the intended path. Therefore, despite the discrepancy in the initial mass percentage calculation, the most logical conclusion is that Y is Iodine and A4 is IF₅. The clues about the bright-red substance A1 and the \"five binary compounds\" are likely distractors or apply to obscure chemical knowledge, a common feature in competitive chemistry questions.\n\nThus, the substance A4 is Iodine Pentafluoride (IF₅), and its molecular weight (221.9 g/mol) falls within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nBased on the chemical properties described, the identity of the substances can be determined, which in turn allows for the calculation of the molecular weight of substance A4.\n\n*   **Identifying Element Y and Substances A1, A2, A3:** The \"bright-red substance\" A1 that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions is a classic description of **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. This identifies element **Y** as **Platinum (Pt)**. The decomposition of A1 produces fluorine and A2. PtF₆ decomposes into **Platinum pentafluoride (PtF₅)** and fluorine, making **A2 = PtF₅**. A3, which is obtained by fluorinating element Y and also interacts with xenon, can be identified as **Platinum tetrafluoride (PtF₄)**.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance A4:** The problem states that A5 is formed by adding element Y (Platinum) to a \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". The platinum fluorides themselves are colored (PtF₆ is dark-red, PtF₄ is red-orange). This suggests A4 is not a binary fluoride of platinum. The fact that A1 and A3 react with xenon introduces xenon compounds as plausible reactants. A key candidate for A4 is **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂)**. Xenon difluoride is a colorless crystalline solid that can be dissolved to form a colorless solution. It is also a powerful fluorinating agent capable of reacting with platinum metal.\n\n*   **The Reaction and Identifying A5:** The reaction between platinum metal (Y) and a solution of xenon difluoride (A4) in a 1:1 molar ratio would proceed as follows:\n    Pt + XeF₂ → PtF₂ + Xe\n    This reaction is plausible, with platinum being oxidized and xenon being reduced. This identifies substance A5 as **Platinum difluoride (PtF₂)**. The final clue states that A5 decomposes in water. Indeed, platinum(II) fluoride is known to be hydrolyzed by water.\n\n*   **Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4:** Now that A4 has been identified as Xenon difluoride (XeF₂), its molecular weight can be calculated.\n    *   Atomic weight of Xenon (Xe) ≈ 131.29 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of XeF₂ = 131.29 + (2 × 19.00) = **169.29 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:**\n    *   The prompt states that element Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine. This is a rare property. Gold (Au) is a known element that forms five such compounds: AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with the clue that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine implies A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2.\n    *   Let's calculate the ɷF for the higher gold fluorides:\n        *   For AuF₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 254 g/mol): ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 254.0 = 22.4%\n        *   For AuF₅ (Molar Mass ≈ 292 g/mol): ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / 292.0 = 32.5%\n    *   The calculated mass percentage for AuF₅ (32.5%) is a very close match to the given 31.96%. Thus, we can confidently identify **A2 as AuF₅**. This strongly supports the hypothesis that **Y is Gold (Au)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A2, and A3:**\n    *   **A2** is **AuF₅**.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (AuF₅) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of gold, which is **AuF₇**. The description of A1 as a powerful oxidizing agent that can react with xenon is consistent with a high-oxidation-state fluoride. Gold(V) fluoride, the core of this compound, is also described as a red solid.\n    *   **A3** is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Au). The direct reaction of gold with fluorine typically produces **AuF₃**. AuF₃ is also a powerful fluorinating agent and could interact with xenon as stated.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   The five binary fluorides are AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇. We have assigned A1, A2, and A3, leaving AuF and AuF₂ for A4 and A5.\n    *   The crucial clue is the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: **Au + A4 → A5**.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction, where gold in different oxidation states reacts to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test the possibility where **A4 = AuF₂** and **A5 = AuF**. The reaction would be:\n        Au(0) + Au(II)F₂ → 2Au(I)F\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and chemically plausible. Importantly, the reactants Au (Y) and AuF₂ (A4) are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, perfectly matching the clue. The substance obtained is AuF (A5).\n    *   The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is also consistent, as AuF is unstable and would disproportionate in water.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Based on the deduction, substance **A4 is AuF₂** (gold(II) fluoride).\n    *   The molecular weight (molar mass) of AuF₂ is calculated as follows:\n        *   Atomic weight of Gold (Au) ≈ 196.97 g/mol\n        *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   Molecular Weight of AuF₂ = 196.97 + (2 * 18.998) = **234.966 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (≈235 g/mol) falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the element, M(Y) is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (M(Y) + 19n)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element Y:\n    *   n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca=40.1)\n    *   n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br=79.9)\n    *   n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n    *   n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy=162.5)\n    *   n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (in the region of Bi, Pb, Hg)\n    *   n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu=244)\n\n    Let's check the most promising candidate, **Y = Sb (Antimony)**, with **n = 3**.\n    A2 would be **SbF₃**. Let's verify the mass percentage:\n    ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a difference of only 0.25%. This makes Antimony the most likely candidate for element Y.\n\n2.  **Analyze the other compounds and reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Antimony forms SbF₃ and SbF₅ as its main stable binary fluorides, but other less stable or polymeric species are known, making this plausible.\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). The reaction is A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. By mass balance, A1 must be **SbF₅**. A1 also oxidizes xenon, which is a known property of the extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent SbF₅. (Note: The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" contradicts the known properties of pure SbF₅, which is a colorless liquid/solid stable at that temperature. This is likely an error or misleading information in the problem statement).\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and it also interacts with xenon. Fluorination of Sb with excess fluorine produces SbF₅, which reacts with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 is one of the binary fluorides of Antimony. The two main possibilities are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**\n    *   M(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**\n\n    Now let's check the given answer ranges:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) fits perfectly into range **C) 160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the ranges. It is closest to D, but outside the specified limits.\n\n    This provides strong evidence that **A4 = SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Final consistency check.**\n    The problem states \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" With A4=SbF₃ and Y=Sb, the reaction is `Sb + SbF₃ → A5`. The stoichiometry of known reactions (e.g., `2Sb + SbF₃ → 3SbF`) does not match the 1:1 ratio. Similar to the properties of A1, this part of the problem statement may be flawed or refer to an obscure reaction. However, the numerical fit from the mass percentage of A2 and the molecular weight of A4 with the given options is too strong to ignore. These numerical clues are the most reliable path to the solution.\n\nConclusion: Based on the mass percentage, element Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃. Based on the provided molecular weight ranges, A4 must be SbF₃, as its molecular weight of ~179 g/mol falls into the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying an element, Y, and its five binary fluoride compounds (A1 to A5). The solution hinges on a combination of quantitative analysis and knowledge of chemical properties.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Substance A2**\n\nThe key piece of information is that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y. Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\nM(Y) = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe must now test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, which is unlikely to form five fluorides and the described compounds).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, which does not fit the subsequent clues).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n\nLet's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in antimony trifluoride (SbF₃):\n*   Molar mass of SbF₃ = 121.76 + (3 × 19.00) = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   Mass fraction of F = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n\nThis calculated value of 31.88% is an excellent match for the given 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances**\n\nWith Y=Sb and A2=SbF₃, we can deduce the identities of the other substances. The known binary fluorides of antimony are primarily SbF₃ and SbF₅. For the purpose of this problem, we assume the existence of five binary compounds as stated.\n\n*   **A1**: This bright-red substance decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, which would be SbF₅. While SbF₅ is typically described as a colorless liquid, the qualitative descriptions in such problems can sometimes be idealized or misleading. The decomposition reaction described (SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂) occurs at high temperatures, not at 293 K, which is another discrepancy, but the chemical identity is the most plausible.\n*   **A3**: This compound is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. The direct, vigorous fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to react with xenon fluorides, thus it \"interacts with xenon\". So, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The problem states that adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 yields A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction where an element in a zero oxidation state reacts with one of its compounds to form a product of an intermediate oxidation state. Given the known chemistry of antimony, a likely, albeit stoichiometrically simplified, intended reaction involves Sb and SbF₅ to produce SbF₃. However, the question asks for the molecular weight of **A4**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nA4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony. The most common and stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. Let's examine their molecular weights:\n*   **MW of SbF₃**: 178.76 g/mol.\n*   **MW of SbF₅**: 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's compare these to the given ranges:\n*   A) 220-240\n*   B) 160-180\n*   C) 140-160\n*   D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within the range of **160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the provided ranges. This strongly suggests that A4 is SbF₃.\n\nAlthough there are contradictions in the qualitative descriptions of the reactions and properties, the quantitative data (mass percentage and molecular weight) point consistently towards this solution.\n\nThe molecular weight of substance A4 is therefore in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is its oxidation state.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    Let's rearrange to solve for the molar mass of Y (M_Y):\n    M_Y = (n * M_F / ɷF) - (n * M_F) = n * M_F * (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Using the molar mass of fluorine (M_F ≈ 19.00 g/mol) and the given percentage (ɷF = 0.3196):\n    M_Y ≈ n * 19.00 * (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ n * 19.00 * (3.129 - 1) ≈ n * 40.45 g/mol.\n    We can test plausible integer values for n (common oxidation states):\n    *   If n=1, M_Y ≈ 40.5 g/mol (Close to K, Ca, Ar - unlikely candidates for forming five binary fluorides and reacting with Xenon).\n    *   If n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Br, M=79.9 g/mol. A possibility).\n    *   If n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.4 g/mol (Very close to Sb, Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol. A strong candidate).\n    *   If n=4, M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No stable element).\n    *   If n=5, M_Y ≈ 202.3 g/mol (Close to Bi, Bismuth, M=208.98 g/mol. A possibility).\n\n    Let's calculate the theoretical ɷF for the most likely candidates to see which is the best fit:\n    *   For BrF2 (assuming n=2, Y=Br): ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (79.90 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 117.90 = 32.23%\n    *   For SbF3 (assuming n=3, Y=Sb): ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 = 31.88%\n    *   For BiF5 (assuming n=5, Y=Bi): ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / (208.98 + 5 * 19.00) = 95 / 303.98 = 31.25%\n\n    Comparing these to the given value of 31.96%, SbF3 (31.88%) is by far the closest match. Therefore, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb (Antimony)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances A1, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   **A1 & A3**: The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon and A3 is formed by fluorinating Y and also reacts with xenon. Strong fluorinating agents like SbF5 are known to react with xenon. SbF3 does not. This identifies **A1 = A3 = SbF5**. The information about A1 being red and decomposing is likely related to its high reactivity or impurities, as pure SbF5 is colorless.\n    *   **A4 & A5**: The key reaction is \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    This is a comproportionation reaction, where elemental antimony (oxidation state 0) reduces the antimony in A4 to a lower oxidation state in A5. Given the common fluorides are SbF3 (+3) and SbF5 (+5), the only logical transformation is the reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III).\n    Thus, **A4 = SbF5** and **A5 = SbF3**.\n    The 1:1 molar ratio likely refers to the recipe for the synthesis, not the balanced chemical equation (which is 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3).\n    The final clue supports this: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" A5 is SbF3. The hydrolysis of antimony trifluoride (SbF3 + H₂O → SbOF + 2HF) produces two new substances: antimony oxyfluoride and hydrogen fluoride.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    We have identified A4 as Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5). We will now calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Molar Mass of Antimony (Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass of SbF5 = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    We compare the calculated molecular weight (216.75 g/mol) to the given ranges:\n    A) 110-130\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n    The calculated value of 216.75 g/mol is not strictly within any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range D. This suggests a potential small error in the problem's ranges. Given the clear chemical identification of A4 as SbF5, range D is the only plausible answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define atomic masses\nmolar_mass_sb = 121.76  # Molar mass of Antimony (Sb) in g/mol\nmolar_mass_f = 18.998   # Molar mass of Fluorine (F) in g/mol\n\n# Step 2: Identify A4\n# Based on the chemical reasoning:\n# The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) strongly indicates A2 is SbF3, so element Y is Sb.\n# The reaction Y + A4 -> A5 (Sb + A4 -> A5) is a comproportionation.\n# The higher fluoride, SbF5, is reduced by Sb to the lower fluoride, SbF3.\n# Therefore, A4 is SbF5.\nsubstance_A4_formula = \"SbF5\"\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 (SbF5)\nnum_sb_atoms = 1\nnum_f_atoms = 5\nmolecular_weight_A4 = (num_sb_atoms * molar_mass_sb) + (num_f_atoms * molar_mass_f)\n\n# Step 4: Compare the result with the given ranges and select the correct option.\n# A) 110-130\n# B) 160-180\n# C) 140-160\n# D) 220-240\n# The calculated molecular weight is 216.75 g/mol.

The reaction is: A1 → A2 + F2. This means A1 is a higher fluoride of element Y than A2.\n*   We are given the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the general formula YF_n, where Y is the element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F)), where M(F) ≈ 19 g/mol and M(Y) is the atomic mass of element Y.\n*   We can write: 0.3196 = (n × 19) / (M(Y) + n × 19).\n*   Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n - (0.3196 × 19n)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n × (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = 19n × 0.6804\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n*   Now we test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y in A2):\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.5 g/mol (fits Potassium or Calcium, which do not form the described compounds).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (fits Bromine, but its fluorides don't match other criteria).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's test this candidate.\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no suitable element).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (near Gold, Bismuth, etc., but the fit is not as good).\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (fits Plutonium (Pu), M=244 g/mol). Let's check ɷF in PuF6: (6*19)/(244+114) = 114/358 = 31.84%. This is also a very good fit. However, if A2=PuF6, A1 would have to be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF7 or PuF8), which is not known to exist. Therefore, the Plutonium hypothesis is invalid.\n*   The best candidate is **Y = Antimony (Sb)**. Let's verify the mass percent for A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 × 19 = 178.76 g/mol. ɷF = (3 × 19) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Identify A1, A2, and A3 based on Y=Sb.**\n*   Y = Sb.\n*   A2 = SbF3.\n*   From the decomposition A1 → A2 + F2, we get A1 → SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 = SbF5. The reaction is SbF5 → SbF3 + F2.\n*   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. Sb + F2 → SbF5 is a standard reaction. A3 reacts with xenon. SbF5 is a strong Lewis acid and reacts with XeF2 to form complexes like [XeF]+[SbF6]-, thus it \"interacts with xenon\". So A3 = SbF5.\n*   There are some inconsistencies: The problem says A1 is a \"bright-red substance\". SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid. It also states five binary fluorides are known, whereas only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, as the quantitative data points strongly to Sb.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction involving A4 and A5.**\n*   The clue is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" With Y=Sb, the reaction is:\n    Sb + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n*   The final clue is: \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" This is characteristic of the hydrolysis of antimony halides. For example, antimony(III) chloride hydrolyzes: SbCl3 + H2O → SbOCl(s) + 2HCl(aq). This produces two substances (antimony oxychloride and hydrochloric acid).\n*   Let's assume A5 is an antimony(III) halide, like SbCl3, as it fits the hydrolysis description.\n*   If A5 = SbCl3, the reaction becomes: Sb + A4 → SbCl3 (1:1).\n*   This suggests a displacement reaction where A4 is a chloride of a less reactive element, X: Sb + XCl3 → SbCl3 + X. This reaction is 1:1.\n*   We need to find a substance A4=XCl3 that fits the following criteria:\n    1.  X is less reactive (less metallic) than Sb.\n    2.  The reaction Sb + XCl3 → SbCl3 + X proceeds.\n    3.  A solution of XCl3 is colorless.\n    4.  The molecular weight of XCl3 falls into one of the given ranges.\n*   Let's check candidates for X. A neighboring element in the periodic table is a good place to start. Antimony (Sb) is more metallic than Arsenic (As). Thus, the reaction `Sb + AsCl3 → SbCl3 + As` is favorable.\n*   Let's check if A4 = AsCl3 fits the remaining criteria.\n    *   **Color:** AsCl3 is a colorless fuming oily liquid. Its solution is colorless. This fits.\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** M(AsCl3) = M(As) + 3 × M(Cl) ≈ 74.92 + 3 × 35.45 = 74.92 + 106.35 = 181.27 g/mol.\n    *   **Check ranges:** The calculated molecular weight of 181.27 g/mol falls squarely within the range **160-180**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n*   All the chemical evidence from the second part of the problem consistently points to A4 being Arsenic trichloride (AsCl3).\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A4 = AsCl3\n*   A5 = SbCl3\n*   The molecular weight of A4 (AsCl3) is ~181.3 g/mol.\n*   This falls into the range provided by option C.\n\nThe molecular weight of the substance A4 falls in the range 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe step-by-step reasoning has led to the identification of the unknown element Y and the specific compounds involved.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** From the information that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass, we deduced the atomic mass of element Y.\n    Let the atomic mass of Y be Ar(Y) and the formula of A2 be Y_mF_n.\n    The mass fraction of F is: ɷ(F) = (n * Ar(F)) / (m * Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (m * Ar(Y) + n * 18.998)\n    Rearranging for Ar(Y): Ar(Y) ≈ (n/m) * 40.445\n    Testing simple integer ratios for n/m, a ratio of 5/2 gives Ar(Y) ≈ 101.1 g/mol, which corresponds to Ruthenium (Ru, atomic weight 101.07 g/mol). So, Y is Ru and A2 is Ru2F5.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5:** The problem states that adding Y (Ru metal) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio produces A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction. A likely reaction following a 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n    Ru + RuF4 → 2RuF2\n    In this case, A4 would be RuF4 and A5 would be RuF2.\n\n3.  **Verify with Other Clues:** The final clue is that A5 (RuF2) decomposes in water into two substances. This is consistent with the hydrolysis of a metal fluoride:\n    RuF2 + 2H2O → Ru(OH)2 + 2HF\n    This produces two substances: ruthenium(II) hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid. Thus, our identification of A4 as RuF4 is well-supported.\n\n4.  **Calculate Molecular Weight of A4:** Now we calculate the molecular weight of A4 (RuF4).\n    MW(RuF4) = Ar(Ru) + 4 * Ar(F)\n    MW(RuF4) = 101.07 + 4 * 18.998\n    MW(RuF4) = 101.07 + 75.992 = 177.062 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:** The calculated molecular weight is 177.062 g/mol. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 220-240\n\nThe value 177.062 falls squarely within the range 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nBased on the analysis of the provided information, the most chemically consistent hypothesis identifies element Y as Iodine (I).\n\n*   **Element Y and its fluorides:** Y is identified as Iodine (I). Iodine is known to form several binary fluorides, including IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇, satisfying the condition of forming multiple such compounds.\n\n*   **Identification of A2 and A4:** The mass percentage of fluorine in substance A2 is given as 31.96%. Iodine trifluoride (IF₃) has a fluorine content of approximately 31.0%. This is a reasonable match. The substance A4 is identified through the reaction where element Y (Iodine, I₂) is added to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. The known comproportionation reaction `I₂ + IF₃ → 3IF` fits this description perfectly. Therefore, **A4 is Iodine Trifluoride (IF₃)** and A5 is Iodine Monofluoride (IF). Since the fluorine percentage matches A2, A2 is also IF₃.\n\n*   **Identification of A1:** Substance A1 decomposes into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine. This implies that A1 must be a higher fluoride of iodine, such as IF₅ or IF₇. The reaction `IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂` is plausible. A1 is also described as a strong oxidizing agent that can oxidize xenon, a known property of higher iodine fluorides. The clue about A1 being a \"bright-red substance\" contradicts the fact that IF₅ is a colorless liquid; this is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as the rest of the chemical evidence strongly supports the iodine hypothesis.\n\n*   **Identification of A3:** A3 is formed by the fluorination of iodine and can also react with xenon. This could be any of the higher iodine fluorides, like IF₅ or IF₇, which are produced by the direct reaction of iodine and fluorine.\n\nWith A4 identified as IF₃, we can determine its molecular weight.\n*   The molecular formula for A4 is IF₃.\n*   The atomic weight of Iodine (I) is approximately 126.9 g/mol.\n*   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.0 g/mol.\n*   Molecular Weight of IF₃ = 126.9 + (3 × 19.0) = 126.9 + 57.0 = 183.9 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (183.9 g/mol) fits into the range given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the substance A4:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The clue that substance A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions is critical. The first compound of a noble gas was created in 1962 by Neil Bartlett when he reacted platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) with xenon. This strongly suggests that element **Y is Platinum (Pt)**. A1, the bright-red substance, is **platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A2:** The problem states that A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%. Let's examine the known fluorides of platinum.\n    *   **Platinum(V) fluoride (PtF₅):** It exists as a deep-red solid tetramer [PtF₅]₄. The mass percentage of fluorine in the PtF₅ monomer is 32.75%. This value is very close to the 31.96% given in the problem, with the small difference likely due to rounding in the problem's data. Therefore, **A2 is PtF₅**. The decomposition is PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½F₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A3:** A3 is obtained by fluorinating platinum and can also interact with xenon. Platinum tetrafluoride (PtF₄) can be formed by the direct fluorination of platinum. Furthermore, platinum reacts with xenon tetrafluoride to produce platinum tetrafluoride and xenon gas (XeF₄ + Pt → PtF₄ + Xe), which qualifies as an interaction. Thus, **A3 is PtF₄**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4:** This is the core of the problem. Here is what we know about A4:\n    *   It exists as a hot, colorless, concentrated solution.\n    *   Platinum metal (Y) is added to this solution in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5.\n    *   The known simple platinum fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆) are all colored solids and would not form a colorless solution. Platinum(II) fluoride is insoluble in water. This suggests A4 is not one of the simple binary fluorides of platinum.\n    *   The problem's context is rich with platinum and xenon chemistry. Therefore, A4 is likely another fluorine-containing compound, possibly another strong fluorinating agent. Candidates include interhalogen compounds or other xenon fluorides.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Candidates for A4 based on Molecular Weight:**\n    *   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆):** This is a strong fluorinating agent. It is a colorless solid that could form a colorless solution. It reacts with platinum. The products of this reaction would be various platinum fluorides, which are known to decompose in water. The molecular weight of XeF₆ is approximately 245.3 g/mol. This value falls into the range of **220-240**.\n    *   **Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅):** This is another strong, colorless fluorinating agent. It has a molecular weight of approximately 221.9 g/mol. This value also falls into the range of **220-240**.\n\nBoth XeF₆ and IF₅ fit the description and lead to the same molecular weight range. Given the thematic consistency with xenon chemistry throughout the problem, XeF₆ is a particularly fitting candidate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecular weight of substance A4 must fall within the 220-240 g/mol range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of the substances and the molecular weight of A4:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2**: The clue states that A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, the atomic mass of Y be M(Y), and the atomic mass of F be 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    If we test different integer values for n, we can find a corresponding mass for Y. Rearranging the formula: M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / ɷF) - (n * 19.00).\n    M(Y) = (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    While several possibilities exist, the other clues point strongly towards a specific element.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues for A1 and its Relationship to A2**:\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). This means A1 is a higher, less stable fluoride of Y than A2.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions, indicating it is a very powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   This set of properties (color, decomposition to a lower fluoride and F₂, extreme oxidizing power) is characteristic of Krypton's chemistry. Specifically, Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄) was once claimed to be a bright-red or white solid that is highly unstable at room temperature and decomposes to Krypton Difluoride (KrF₂) and Fluorine. Reports on the existence and color of KrF₄ vary, and it is considered hypothetical or only stable under high pressure by modern sources. However, within the context of a chemical puzzle, these historical or theoretical properties are often used as clues. Let's assume **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n    *   This makes **A1 = KrF₄** and **A2 = KrF₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify the Mass Percentage for KrF₂**:\n    *   The molar mass of Kr is 83.80 g/mol.\n    *   The molar mass of KrF₂ is 83.80 + 2 * 19.00 = 121.80 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of F in KrF₂ is (2 * 19.00) / 121.80 = 31.2%.\n    *   This is reasonably close to the given value of 31.96%. Small discrepancies are common in such problems.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Kr) and can also interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of krypton produces krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is a powerful oxidizing agent and can oxidize xenon to xenon hexafluoride. Thus, **A3 is KrF₂**.\n\n5.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5**:\n    *   The key clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This translates to the reaction: **Kr + A4 → A5** (1:1 ratio).\n    *   A4 is one of the five binary krypton fluorides and its solution is colorless. KrF₂ forms a colorless solid and its solutions are also colorless. KrF₄ is described as a red or white solid. Let's examine the possible reactions.\n    *   If **A4 = KrF₂**, the reaction would be Kr + KrF₂ → A5. There is no common, simple reaction product (A5) for this 1:1 reaction.\n    *   If **A4 = KrF₄**, the reaction would be Kr + KrF₄ → A5. This corresponds to a known synproportionation reaction: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂**. This reaction proceeds with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n    *   This suggests that **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   This interpretation contradicts the clue that the solution of A4 is \"colorless\". However, the specific 1:1 molar ratio strongly points to a defined chemical equation, which is often a more reliable clue in chemical puzzles than a descriptive property that might be simplified or contain an error.\n    *   The final clue, \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\", fits this interpretation. A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water to form Krypton (Kr) and Oxygen (O₂), along with hydrofluoric acid. The \"two substances\" likely refer to the elemental products Kr and O₂.\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the analysis, A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of KrF₄ = MW(Kr) + 4 * MW(F)\n    *   MW(KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 * 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls into the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the formula YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_F is the atomic mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M_Y is the atomic mass of element Y.\n*   n is an integer.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M_Y:\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M_Y + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 * M_Y = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\nM_Y = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\nM_Y ≈ n * 40.45\n\nNow we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y with atomic mass M_Y:\n*   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Calcium, Ca). Unlikely to form the described compounds.\n*   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Bromine, Br). Chemistry doesn't fit well.\n*   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol).\n*   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, M ≈ 162.5 g/mol).\n*   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol. (e.g., Gold, Au, M=197).\n*   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the mass percentages for the best candidates precisely:\n*   **Y=Sb, n=3 (A2=SbF₃)**: M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3*19.00 = 178.76. ɷF = (57/178.76) * 100% = **31.88%**. (Excellent match)\n*   **Y=Dy, n=4 (A2=DyF₄)**: M(DyF₄) = 162.5 + 4*19.00 = 238.5. ɷF = (76/238.5) * 100% = **31.86%**. (Excellent match)\n*   **Y=Pu, n=6 (A2=PuF₆)**: M(PuF₆) = 244 + 6*19.00 = 358. ɷF = (114/358) * 100% = **31.84%**. (Excellent match)\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical plausibility of each candidate.**\n\nWe must now use the other chemical clues to decide between Sb, Dy, and Pu.\n\n*   **Pu Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage for PuF₆ is a good fit for A2, other clues create contradictions. For instance, A1 decomposes to A2 and fluorine. The only known decomposition of this type is PuF₆ → PuF₄ + F₂. This would imply A1=PuF₆ and A2=PuF₄. But we identified A2 as PuF₆ from the mass percent. This is a fatal contradiction.\n\n*   **Sb Hypothesis**: Antimony chemistry is very rich with fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅, and various mixed-valence compounds like SbF₄, Sb₂F₇), fitting the \"five binary compounds\" clue. Many of the qualitative clues fit if one assumes errors in the problem statement (a common trait of olympiad-style problems). For example, A3, which reacts with Xe, is likely SbF₅. A1 decomposing to A2(SbF₃) would imply A1=SbF₅, but the properties don't match and it creates an identity clash with A3. If we proceed by identifying A4, the most plausible candidate is SbF₅ (as it's a liquid and can be a \"concentrated solution\"). Its molecular weight is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the given ranges, although it is very close to range A [220-240]. This discrepancy suggests this might not be the intended answer.\n\n*   **Dy Hypothesis**: Let's test the Dysprosium case, which also had an excellent mass percentage match.\n    *   Y = Dy, **A2 = DyF₄**.\n    *   \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\". This implies A1 → DyF₄ + F₂, which means **A1 = DyF₆**. DyF₆ is not a stable, known compound, but may be assumed to exist for the problem.\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" This suggests A3 is a strong oxidizer, like DyF₆ or possibly DyF₄.\n    *   \"A5 is obtained by adding Y (Dy) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This is a comproportionation reaction: `Dy(0) + A4 -> A5`. This means A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5.\n    *   \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\". Let's test the hydrolysis of dysprosium fluorides. `DyF₃ + 3H₂O → Dy(OH)₃↓ + 3HF`. This produces two substances, a solid precipitate and an aqueous acid. So, a plausible candidate for **A5 is DyF₃**.\n    *   Now, let's identify A4 from the reaction: `Dy + A4 → A5(DyF₃)`. To produce Dy(III)F₃ from Dy(0), A4 must be a fluoride with an oxidation state higher than +3. The logical choice is **A4 = DyF₄**. The balanced reaction is `Dy + 3DyF₄ → 4DyF₃`. The 1:1 ratio given in the problem is inconsistent, which is a common issue in such problems.\n    *   This hypothesis provides a full (though not perfectly consistent) set of assignments for the compounds. Crucially, it identifies A4.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nBased on the Dysprosium hypothesis, **A4 is DyF₄**.\nLet's calculate its molecular weight:\nM(DyF₄) = M(Dy) + 4 * M(F)\nM(DyF₄) = 162.5 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol\nM(DyF₄) = 162.5 + 76.0\nM(DyF₄) = **238.5 g/mol**\n\nNow, we check which of the given ranges contains this value:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 238.5 g/mol falls squarely within the range **220-240**. While the Dysprosium chemistry is exotic, it provides a numerically perfect answer, which is often the intended solution path when the problem text contains inconsistencies.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y.**\n    *   We are given that substance A2 has a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, F is fluorine, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M_Y is the molar mass of Y, and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol).\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F).\n    *   Substituting the given values: 0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00).\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for M_Y: M_Y = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n = 19.00n * (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ 40.45n.\n    *   We need to find a plausible element Y by testing integer values for n. The element Y is known to form five binary compounds with fluorine. This points towards elements that can exhibit multiple oxidation states, such as p-block nonmetals or certain transition metals.\n    *   Let's test values of n:\n        *   n = 1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca). Unlikely to form five fluorides.\n        *   n = 2: M_Y ≈ 80.90 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se). Plausible.\n        *   n = 3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Plausible.\n        *   n = 4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy). Unlikely.\n        *   n = 5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Hg). Unlikely.\n        *   n = 6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Am). Unlikely.\n    *   The statement that A1 (a fluoride of Y) \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\" is a very strong clue. Only a few substances are powerful enough to do this. The fluorides of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and krypton (Kr) are known for this reactivity.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities against our calculated M_Y.\n        *   If Y = Kr (M_Y = 83.8 g/mol), for n=2, our formula gives M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is a very close match.\n        *   If Y = Pt (M_Y = 195.08 g/mol), no integer n gives a close match.\n        *   If Y = Ru (M_Y = 101.07 g/mol), for n=2.5 (not an integer, so not a simple binary compound), M_Y would be ~101.1 g/mol.\n    *   Krypton (Kr) is the most likely candidate for Y. Krypton forms several binary fluorides: KrF2, KrF4, and potentially others under specific conditions. While \"five\" might be a slight exaggeration or include unstable/matrix-isolated species, the chemical properties strongly point towards Kr.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   Let's assume Y = Kr.\n    *   A2 has the formula YF_n. Since we found n=2 gives the best fit for the molar mass, A2 is **KrF2**.\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine (F2). This implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2. The next known fluoride is **KrF4**. The decomposition reaction is: KrF4 → KrF2 + F2. KrF4 is known to be unstable, decomposing above -30 °C (243 K), which fits the description of decomposing at 293 K (20 °C). The description \"bright-red\" may be an inaccuracy, as it's typically described as a volatile white solid, but chemical properties are a stronger indicator than color in such problems. A1's ability to oxidize xenon is consistent with it being a powerful fluorinating agent like KrF4.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Kr) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. This is the synthesis of **KrF2** or **KrF4** from the elements. Kr + F2 → KrF2. As KrF4 (A1) also fits this description, A3 is likely KrF2. The interaction with xenon could be a ligand exchange or further oxidation under specific conditions. Let's tentatively assign A3 as KrF2.\n    *   Now, let's identify A4 and A5. A5 is obtained by adding Y (Kr) to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A4 is another binary compound of fluorine and Y (Krypton). The most stable and common fluoride of krypton is KrF2 (A2). It's plausible that the other fluorides mentioned are Lewis acid-base adducts with KrF2. For example, KrF2 can react with strong Lewis acids like AsF5 and SbF5.\n    *   A strong candidate for A4 is a Lewis acid that can form an adduct with KrF2. The elements near Krypton that form strong fluoride Lewis acids are in Group 15, namely Arsenic (As) and Antimony (Sb).\n    *   Let's consider the reaction: `A4 + Kr -> A5` (1:1 molar ratio). If A4 is a krypton-fluorine compound, this reaction is unclear. It is more likely that the problem description meant \"A5 is obtained by adding **A2** to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio\". This is a common pattern in inorganic chemistry problems where a simple fluoride (like A2 = KrF2) is reacted with a Lewis acid (A4). Let's proceed with this more plausible interpretation.\n    *   Reaction: A4 + A2 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio). `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`. This is a classic Lewis acid-base reaction. A4 must be a strong Lewis acid fluoride. Let's assume **A4 = AsF5** or **A4 = SbF5**.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = AsF5**. Molar mass = 74.92 (As) + 5 * 19.00 (F) = 74.92 + 95.00 = **169.92 g/mol**.\n    *   The reaction would be: AsF5 + KrF2 → [KrF]+[AsF6]-. So, **A5 = [KrF]+[AsF6]-**.\n    *   The problem states A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. The salt [KrF]+[AsF6]- is known to be unstable in water and decomposes, for example, to Kr, O2, HF, and H3AsO4. This fits the description.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = SbF5**. Molar mass = 121.76 (Sb) + 5 * 19.00 (F) = 121.76 + 95.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n    *   The reaction would be: SbF5 + KrF2 → [KrF]+[SbF6]-. So, **A5 = [KrF]+[SbF6]-**. This also decomposes in water.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Weight Range for A4.**\n    *   We have identified two strong candidates for A4: AsF5 and SbF5.\n    *   Molecular weight of AsF5 = 169.92 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of SbF5 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    *   Let's re-examine the reaction: `By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.` If we take this literally, it means `A4 + Kr -> A5`. This is chemically less plausible than `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`. However, some high-oxidation-state fluorides (like RuF6 or PtF6) can react directly with noble gases. If A4 were such a compound, its molar mass would be much higher (RuF6 ≈ 215 g/mol, PtF6 ≈ 309 g/mol).\n    *   Given the common patterns in such chemistry problems, the interpretation of the reaction being between the simple fluoride (A2) and a Lewis acid (A4) is the most probable one. The wording might be slightly imprecise.\n    *   If we assume A4 is AsF5, its molecular weight is 169.92 g/mol. This falls squarely in the range of 160-180.\n    *   If we assume A4 is SbF5, its molecular weight is 216.76 g/mol. This does not fit any of the provided ranges well.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   The most logical identification for element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n    *   A2 is KrF2.\n    *   The reaction to form A5 is most likely `A4 + KrF2 -> A5`.\n    *   A4 is a strong Lewis acid fluoride, with AsF5 being the most suitable candidate.\n    *   The molecular weight of AsF5 is approximately 170 g/mol.\n    *   This molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The most direct piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, so its formula can be written as YFₓ.\n    Given: The mass percentage of fluorine (ω(F)) in A2 is 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ω(F) = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))\n    Where Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of element Y.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n    Ar(Y) = (x * Ar(F) * (1 - ω(F))) / ω(F)\n    Ar(Y) = (x * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\n    Ar(Y) = (x * 19.00 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n    We now test integer values for x to find an element with a matching atomic weight:\n    *   If x = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, but the complex fluoride chemistry described does not fit Calcium).\n    *   If x = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, but its chemistry doesn't fully match all clues).\n    *   If x = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This atomic weight is very close to that of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's verify this by calculating the mass percentage of F in SbF₃:\n        ω(F) in SbF₃ = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%, confirming that **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Other Compounds.**\n    *   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine\" and \"can also interact with xenon\". The direct fluorination of antimony (Sb) yields antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅. SbF₅ is an extremely potent Lewis acid and is famous for reacting with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₂ + SbF₅ → [XeF]⁺[SbF₆]⁻). Therefore, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n    *   **A4**: The problem states we use a \"hot colorless concentrated **solution of A4**\". In the context of aggressive fluorine chemistry, a common solvent is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF). When SbF₅ (our A3) is dissolved in HF, it forms the superacid **fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆**. A solution of this acid is colorless. This is the most chemically sound candidate for A4, where A4 is the solute that constitutes the active species in the solution.\n    *   **A1 and A5**: The descriptions of A1 (\"bright-red\", decomposes into SbF₃ and F₂) and the reaction to form A5 are complex and contain some inconsistencies with the properties of simple binary antimony fluorides. However, the identities of A2, A3, and A4 are strongly supported by the main chemical facts.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on our deduction, A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆. We can now calculate its molecular weight using the atomic weights of Hydrogen (H ≈ 1.008), Antimony (Sb ≈ 121.76), and Fluorine (F ≈ 18.998).\n\n    MW(HSbF₆) = Ar(H) + Ar(Sb) + 6 * Ar(F)\n\n    Let's perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Atomic weights from IUPAC\n# H: 1.008 g/mol\n# Sb: 121.760 g/mol\n# F: 18.998 g/mol\n\n# Calculate the molecular weight of fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF6)\nmw_hsbf6 = 1.008 + 121.760 + 6 * 18.998\nprint(mw_hsbf6)\n```\n<execute_result>\n236.756\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 (HSbF₆) is 236.756 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    We now compare this value to the given options:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The value 236.756 falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 236.756\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nBased on the detailed reasoning and calculations performed:\n\n1.  **Identification of Element Y**: The element Y was identified as Antimony (Sb) by analyzing the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2. A calculation based on ωF = 31.96% for a compound YFx led to an atomic weight for Y of approximately 121.35 g/mol (assuming x=3), which strongly points to Antimony (Ar = 121.76 g/mol). Therefore, A2 is SbF3.\n\n2.  **Identification of Compound A4**: The chemical reactions described in the problem were analyzed. The reaction where elemental Y (Antimony) is added to a solution of A4 to produce A5 (`Sb + A4 → A5`) is a comproportionation reaction. This requires A4 to be an antimony compound in a higher oxidation state than Sb(0). The most common and stable higher-valent fluoride of antimony is Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5), which contains Sb in the +5 oxidation state. Therefore, A4 is identified as SbF5.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Molecular Weight of A4**: The molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) was calculated using the atomic weights of Antimony (Sb ≈ 121.76 g/mol) and Fluorine (F ≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n    Molecular Weight (SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Selection of the Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol needs to be matched with the given ranges:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 140-160\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The value of 216.76 g/mol is closest to the range D) 220-240. Although not strictly within the range, the discrepancy is minor and likely due to rounding in the problem statement's values or ranges. The chemical identification of A4 as SbF5 is strongly supported by all the clues.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    The problem states that compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is given as 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Using the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) as ~19 g/mol:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M(Y) + n * 19)\n\n    Solving for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine or Selenium)\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n\n    Let's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃:\n    M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol; M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with the minor difference likely due to rounding in the problem data. Thus, we can confidently identify:\n    *   **Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   **A2 = Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**\n\n2.  **Identify Compound A3**\n    *   A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Antimony).\n    *   A3 can interact with xenon. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a well-known strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon fluorides (e.g., XeF₄) to form salts like [XeF₃]⁺[SbF₆]⁻. It can also be prepared by the direct reaction of antimony with fluorine.\n    *   Therefore, **A3 = Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A4**\n    *   A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Elemental antimony (Y) is added to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5. This suggests a comproportionation reaction, where Sb(0) reacts with an antimony compound of a higher oxidation state (present in A4) to form a compound of an intermediate state (A5). A4 must therefore contain antimony in the +5 oxidation state.\n    *   A simple solution of SbF₅ could be considered, but a more prominent chemical entity that fits the description of a \"colorless concentrated solution\" containing Sb(V) is **fluoroantimonic acid (HSbF₆)**.\n    *   Fluoroantimonic acid is a superacid, typically a mixture of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). The 1:1 mixture forms H[SbF₆] and is a colorless liquid. This is the most logical candidate for A4.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n    Assuming A4 is fluoroantimonic acid, HSbF₆, we can calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(H) = 1.008 g/mol\n    M(Sb) = 121.760 g/mol\n    M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    M(HSbF₆) = 1.008 + 121.760 + 6 * 18.998 = 236.756 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 236.76 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\nAlthough there are some inconsistencies in the description of compound A1 (SbF₅ is colorless, not bright-red, and is stable at 293K), the identification of Y as Sb, A2 as SbF₃, and A4 as HSbF₆ is based on strong, consistent chemical evidence. The molecular weight of HSbF₆ definitively fits into one of the provided ranges.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the substances and determine the molecular weight range of A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. We can test several potential elements (Y) that are known to form multiple fluorides. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n_.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y is Antimony (Sb).**\n    *   If A2 is SbF₃, the molar mass is 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.75 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (3 * 18.998) / 178.75 = 31.88%. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y is Krypton (Kr).**\n    *   If A2 is KrF₂, the molar mass is 83.80 + 2 * 18.998 = 121.80 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (2 * 18.998) / 121.80 = 31.197%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Y is Plutonium (Pu).**\n    *   If A2 is PuF₆, the molar mass is 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.99 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (6 * 18.998) / 357.99 = 31.84%. This is also extremely close.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 4: Y is Platinum (Pt).**\n    *   If A2 is PtF₅, the molar mass is 195.08 + 5 * 18.998 = 290.07 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is about 32.75%, which is not as close as the others.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses with Other Clues**\n\nLet's evaluate these possibilities based on the other information provided.\n\n*   **Clue for A1:** It is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (A1 → A2 + F₂). This means A1 must have a higher oxidation state than A2. A1 also oxidizes xenon.\n\n    *   **If Y is Pu and A2 is PuF₆**: It's impossible for A1 to be a higher binary fluoride of plutonium that decomposes into PuF₆ and F₂. This hypothesis is incorrect.\n    *   **If Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃**: Then A1 must be a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid at room temperature and is stable; it does not decompose into SbF₃ and F₂ at 293 K. This contradicts the properties of A1.\n    *   **If Y is Kr and A2 is KrF₂**: Then A1 would be KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and decompose into KrF₂ and F₂ at room temperature (293 K). KrF₄ is also a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. The only discrepancy is its color; KrF₄ is a white/colorless solid, not bright-red. Given the other strong consistencies, the color description in the problem might be inaccurate.\n\n**3. Corroborating with A3, A4, and A5**\n\nLet's proceed with the most plausible hypothesis: **Y is Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n*   **A1 = KrF₄** (Decomposes to A2, oxidizes Xe)\n*   **A2 = KrF₂** (Product of decomposition, matches mass %)\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of element Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂), it also interacts with xenon (KrF₂ + Xe → XeF₂ + Kr). This perfectly describes **A3 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: A hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 reacts with Y (Krypton) in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5.\n    *   The reaction is Y + A4 → A5. This is a synproportionation reaction, where an element in oxidation state 0 (Kr) reacts with the same element in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n    *   For this to work with Krypton, A4 must be KrF₄ (Kr in +4 state) and A5 must be KrF₂ (Kr in +2 state).\n    *   The reaction is **Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂**. This reaction has a **1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants, perfectly matching the problem description.\n    *   Furthermore, A4 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, so its solution would also be colorless. This fits the description.\n*   **Decomposition of A5**: In water, A5 (KrF₂) decomposes with the formation of two substances. The hydrolysis of KrF₂ produces Krypton gas, Oxygen gas, and aqueous hydrofluoric acid (2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF). It's plausible that \"two substances\" refers to the elemental products, Krypton and Oxygen.\n\n**4. Determining the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the consistent chain of evidence, substance A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Kr = ~83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F = ~18.998 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 * 18.998 = 159.792 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to identify the substance A4 and its molecular weight.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and substance A2**: The problem states that A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF). We can test different formulas for A2 (YFₙ) to find the molar mass of Y (Mᵧ).\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (Mᵧ + n * M(F)).\n    Assuming an atomic mass of 19.00 g/mol for Fluorine (F), we can rearrange the formula to solve for Mᵧ: Mᵧ ≈ (n * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n * 19.00), which simplifies to Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    Let's test small integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n=1, Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium).\n    *   If n=2, Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine).\n    *   If n=3, Mᵧ ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    Let's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃). Using precise atomic masses, M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol and M(F) = 19.00 g/mol:\n    ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, or **31.88%**. This is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n    Therefore, element **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and substance **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n2.  **Identify substance A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y. The direct fluorination of antimony with excess fluorine yields the highest stable fluoride.\n    `Sb + excess F₂ → SbF₅`\n    Thus, **A3 is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**.\n\n3.  **Identify substances A4 and A5**: The problem describes a reaction where element Y (Sb) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 to obtain A5.\n    `Sb + A4 → A5`\n    This is a comproportionation reaction, where antimony in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with an antimony fluoride (A4) to produce an antimony fluoride with an intermediate oxidation state (A5). The most common reaction of this type for antimony involves the highest oxidation state fluoride, SbF₅, reacting with elemental antimony to produce the more stable lower oxidation state fluoride, SbF₃. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n    `2 Sb + 3 SbF₅ → 5 SbF₃`\n    The problem states that Y and A4 are added in a 1:1 molar ratio. This does not mean it's the stoichiometric ratio of the reaction. It means that if we mix, for example, 3 moles of Sb with 3 moles of SbF₅, the reaction will proceed, and A5 will be obtained. In this case, all 3 moles of SbF₅ would react with 2 moles of Sb, leaving 1 mole of Sb unreacted, and successfully producing 5 moles of SbF₃. This interpretation fits the chemical facts.\n    Therefore:\n    *   The reactant in solution, **A4, is Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅)**. SbF₅ is a colorless liquid, consistent with the description.\n    *   The product obtained, **A5, is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n4.  **Final Checks**:\n    *   The problem states A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. SbF₃ hydrolyzes in water, forming antimony compounds (like Sb₂O₃ or SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), so this condition is met.\n    *   The remaining clues state A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and oxidizes xenon. While the common antimony fluorides are colorless, the existence of an exotic or unstable red fluoride (A1) does not contradict the identification of A2, A3, A4, and A5, which are based on solid quantitative and reaction data.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**: The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of substance A4. We have identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of SbF₅ = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n    *   MW(SbF₅) ≈ 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    Now we check the given ranges:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 160-180 (This range contains the MW of SbF₃, 178.76 g/mol)\n    *   D) 140-160\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall strictly within any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range B (220-240), being just ~1.5% below the lower boundary. Given the high confidence in the chemical identification of A4 as SbF₅ based on the reaction data, it is most likely that option B is the intended answer, allowing for a slight inaccuracy in the provided ranges.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
