We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial concentration (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final concentration (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM2 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of acid equal the moles of base (n_acid = n_base).\n\n*   Moles of acetic acid (n_acid) = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   Concentration of NaOH (C_base) = 0.1 M\n*   Volume of NaOH at equivalence point (V_base_eq) = n_acid / C_base\n*   V_base_eq = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n25% titration means we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH reacted = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.00100 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nAt this point, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which forms a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, calculate the pH. Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\npH = 4.733 + log (moles of CH₃COO⁻ / moles of CH₃COOH)\npH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The pKa is calculated from the given Ka value.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** To find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    pH = pKa + log(\\[CH₃COO⁻] / \\[CH₃COOH])\n*   **Ratio of Base to Acid:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH Added:** First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n    Moles of acid = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    \\[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can now calculate the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water. The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same, but the total volume increases.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Initial Volume × Initial Concentration.\n    *   New concentration = Initial moles / New Total Volume.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve, where both the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) are present. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pKa is calculated as -log10(Ka).\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid. So, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n    *   First, calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (moles of acid = moles of base).\n    *   Then, calculate the total volume of the solution and the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the relationship Ka × Kb = Kw (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation for the hydrolysis reaction (CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻) to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate pOH from the [OH⁻] concentration.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison**: Compare the calculated pH values with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nvol_acid_initial_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh = 0.1  # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\n# Convert volumes from cm3 to L\nvol_acid_initial_L = vol_acid_initial_cm3 / 1000\nvol_water_L = vol_water_cm3 / 1000\n\n# Calculate initial moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial_L\n\n# Calculate the new volume and concentration after dilution\nvol_acid_diluted_L = vol_acid_initial_L + vol_water_L\nconc_acid_diluted = moles_acid / vol_acid_diluted_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75\nratio_A_HA = 0.25 / 0.75\n\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH needed = moles of acid\nvol_naoh_eq_L = moles_acid / conc_naoh\n\n# Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq_L = vol_acid_diluted_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] from hydrolysis\n# Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] => Kb = x^2 / (conc_acetate - x)\n# We can approximate that conc_acetate - x ≈ conc_acetate\n# So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\n\n# Calculate pH from pOH\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the results ---\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"B) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"D) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.26; 8.52\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.

The solution's pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of this conjugate base (acetate) in water, which produces OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic (pH > 7). To calculate the pH, one must first find the concentration of the conjugate base, then calculate Kb from Ka (using Kb = Kw / Ka), and then use an ICE table or a derived formula to find the [OH⁻], from which pOH and then pH can be calculated. My calculation leading to pH ≈ 8.52 follows this exact procedure.\n\nThe calculated values of 4.26 and 8.52 match one of the options perfectly.

Moles of NaOH must equal initial moles of HAc.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of HAc has been converted to 0.001 mol of Ac⁻.\n    *   Total volume of solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [Ac⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   Acetate reacts with water (hydrolysis): Ac⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HAc + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Assuming x is small, we can approximate: x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding gives **pH = 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is my plan to solve this titration problem:\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** First, I will calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water using the formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region of the titration.

We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration.\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    *   [A⁻] = 25%\n    *   [HA] = 100% - 25% = 75%\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253 ≈ **4.26**\n\n**Careful point:** At any point before the equivalence point in the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, the solution is a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool. The ratio of moles can be used directly in the equation instead of concentrations, as they are in the same volume.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base of the weak acid. This conjugate base will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Find moles of acid:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   **Find the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Find the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Find the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n*   **Set up the hydrolysis reaction and calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   The reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka\n    *   Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Use the formula for the [OH⁻] of a weak base: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻])\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 ) = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\n**Careful point:** The pH at the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always greater than 7 because the product is a weak base. The final concentration of this weak base must be calculated using the total volume of the solution at that point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe step-by-step reasoning and the python code have correctly calculated the pH at both specified points in the titration.\n\n### Summary of Calculations\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid was diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New Volume = 40.00 cm³\n    *   New Concentration ($M_2$) = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M acetic acid**.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region.

This creates a buffer solution containing the remaining acetic acid (a weak acid) and the newly formed sodium acetate (its conjugate base).\n\n*   **Determine the volume of NaOH for equivalence:** First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to completely neutralize the 0.001 mol of acetic acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH at 25% titration:** 25% of 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³\n\n*   **Calculate moles reacted and remaining:**\n    Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 mol/L * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n    This reacts with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH to form 0.00025 mol of acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n    Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol\n\n*   **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** For a buffer solution, the pH is calculated using this equation.\n    pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n    Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid). Since they are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The solution now contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume:**\n    Total Volume = Initial volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion:**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of the acetate ion:** The acetate ion is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolysis) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   **Calculate Kb:** The base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate can be found from the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming 'x' is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n    **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: **4.26**\n*   At the equivalence point: **8.52**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n**1.

We calculate the new concentration of the acid.\n    *   Initial volume of acid = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Total volume of the diluted solution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n    *   New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2.

This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n*   This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the weak acid is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, we substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **pH = 4.26**\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol\n*   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only CH₃COO⁻ ions, which act as a weak base.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the pOH. We must calculate the Kb for the acetate ion:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, we set up an equilibrium expression to find the concentration of OH⁻:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n    *   The **pH at the equivalence point is 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nThe reasoning and calculations performed are as follows:\n\n**1.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** The first step is crucial. The original 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with an equal volume of water. The concentration used for the titration calculations must be this new, lower concentration.\n2.  **Titration of Weak Acid with Strong Base:** This is a titration of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) with a strong base (NaOH). The pH curve for this type of titration has specific characteristics.\n3.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the \"buffer region,\" before the equivalence point. Here, the solution contains a significant amount of both the weak acid and its conjugate base. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the correct tool for this calculation.\n4.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the initial weak acid has been exactly neutralized by the strong base, converting it entirely into its conjugate base (acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water, which will result in a pH greater than 7.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid after Dilution**\n\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   So, the solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka (1.85x10⁻⁵):\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At this point, 25% of the acid has been converted to the conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio of \\[conjugate base] / \\[acid] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). We first need to find the concentration of the acetate solution.\n*   Initial moles of acid = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the acid = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, where Kb = Kw / Ka:\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [acetate]) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Finally, we calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nComparing this pair of values with the options provided:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa:\npKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nNow, calculate the pH. Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\npH = 4.733 + log (moles of CH₃COO⁻ / moles of CH₃COOH)\npH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\npH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\npH = 4.733 - 0.477\npH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow we set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.020\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\npH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1.

Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is equal to the ratio of their moles. At 25% titration, this ratio is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, we plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26\n\n**3.

Then [CH₃COOH] = x.\n5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.0200 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.0200 M.\n5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.0200\nx² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.0200 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate the pOH:\npOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n\nFinally, calculate the pH:\npH = 14.00 - pOH\npH = 14.00 - 5.48\npH = 8.52\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26\n*   At the equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing this pair (4.26, 8.52) with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1.

We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration.\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    *   [A⁻] = 25%\n    *   [HA] = 100% - 25% = 75%\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253 ≈ **4.26**\n\n**Careful point:** At any point before the equivalence point in the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, the solution is a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool. The ratio of moles can be used directly in the equation instead of concentrations, as they are in the same volume.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base of the weak acid.

This means the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized and converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base that hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]):**\n    *   Moles of acetate = Initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (initial solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH added) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 moles / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:** The relationship between Kₐ, Kₑ, and Kₓ (the ion product of water, 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C) is Kₐ * Kₑ = Kₓ.\n    *   Kₑ = Kₓ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction:**\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can simplify: x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the **pH is 8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26 and at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
