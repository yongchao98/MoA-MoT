A molecule is typically chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This steric hindrance forces the two rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center (an asymmetric carbon atom), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6,6' and 2,2' respectively), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a carbon atom (the second carbon of the propanoate chain) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because it is not bonded to four different groups and possesses a plane of symmetry, it is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism. While benzophenone is achiral, it can be used to create chiral derivatives or can crystallize in a chiral form.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly associated with the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial chirality, while lacking elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The single bond connecting the two phenyl rings can have restricted rotation if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them in a non-planar conformation. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, results in axial chirality, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since C2 is bonded to four distinct substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings. It is sp2 hybridized and trigonal planar. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary to hold the analysis for each compound\n    analysis = {\n        \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": \"Shows optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial/planar chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions are substituted with large enough groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings is prevented. This is called restricted rotation.\n    *   The substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to hinder rotation, forcing the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond.\n    *   We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are not arranged symmetrically. It also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Due to restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry elements, the molecule is chiral. This type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone, with the structure (C6H5)-C(=O)-(C6H5).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized. We need to check for overall molecular symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, show geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. It has two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyl compounds, if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Since each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -NO2 group and a -COOCH3 group), the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which is a sufficient condition for it to be achiral. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism in biphenyls can arise from a phenomenon called atropisomerism, which occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is typically caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are occupied by large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a stable, chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, meaning they are enantiomers and the compound will exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a carbon atom with four different substituents. The molecule itself is achiral; while it can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule is not chiral in solution or gas phases. It possesses a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. It has a double bond and is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism, which is due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two different, non-superimposable mirror-image forms (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers, which are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral form, but the molecule itself is not optically active in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond in the center of the molecule prevents free rotation. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar. Due to these symmetry elements, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism in the Given Compounds:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. For a biphenyl to be chiral, there must be bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this case, the nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at the 6,6' and 2,2' positions, respectively, are bulky enough to prevent rotation. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms) and is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a double bond, which restricts rotation, leading to geometrical isomerism (cis/trans). However, dimethyl fumarate itself is a symmetrical molecule. It has a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has an axis of chirality, such as in allenes, spiranes, or atropisomers (e.g., substituted biphenyls).\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has a plane of chirality.\n\n    A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n*   **Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) is at the 2 and 2' positions, and a nitro group (-NO2) is at the 6 and 6' positions.\n        *   **Chirality:** The steric hindrance caused by these four bulky ortho groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The arrangement of substituents is asymmetric. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   Because of this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and its mirror image is non-superimposable.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism), which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** All four positions adjacent to the linking bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of these large groups at all four *ortho* positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., a -COOCH3 at position 2 and a -NO2 at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   This combination of restricted rotation and lack of symmetry results in a type of chirality known as **axial chirality**, and the resulting isomers are called **atropisomers**.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a simple aromatic ketone with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond) and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral.\n\nThus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be analyzed for sources of chirality. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism if rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. For atropisomerism to lead to optical activity, two conditions must be met: the rotation around the central single bond must be restricted, and the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. In this specific compound, all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the biphenyl linkage. The substitution pattern is asymmetric, meaning the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Therefore, it can be resolved into enantiomers and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Optical isomerism in this type of molecule typically arises from the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two optical isomers, L- and D-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure features a carbon-carbon double bond. The two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), it is not optically active. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is achiral. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) or are diastereomers that are also chiral. A key feature for many optically active molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a twisted, stable conformation. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (C2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since it is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls) and the two phenyl groups are identical, it does not have a chiral center. The molecule itself is achiral and therefore does not exhibit optical isomerism. While individual molecules can be twisted in a crystal lattice to form a chiral crystal, the molecule itself in a non-crystalline state is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It has a double bond which prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its stereoisomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of atropisomer. Atropisomers are stereoisomers that result from hindered rotation around a single bond. In this biphenyl derivative, the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict the rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific conformation. If this conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image, thus exhibiting optical isomerism. The substitution pattern in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate leads to a chiral molecule.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a stereocenter. The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, chiral conformation in a crystal lattice, in solution, the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule is considered achiral on average. It does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nOptical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chirality often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation in certain molecules (atropisomerism). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation, locking the molecule into a specific twisted conformation.\n    *   Furthermore, each ring is asymmetrically substituted (e.g., ring 1 has a -COOCH₃ at C2 and a -NO₂ at C6). This lack of symmetry within the rings, combined with the restricted rotation, makes the molecule chiral. It lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules that are chiral due to hindered rotation are called atropisomers. Since this molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate)**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups.\n    *   The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (the double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized).\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis* isomer).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism can occur in biphenyl compounds when there is restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, happens when there are large, bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this case, the nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions are large enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely. This creates two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), meaning the compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, the central carbon atom (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active (with the exception of meso compounds, which is not applicable here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has two optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In this molecule, the central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) and is also bonded to two phenyl groups. Because this carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, it is sp2 hybridized and has a trigonal planar geometry. To exhibit optical isomerism based on a chiral center, an atom typically must be sp3 hybridized and bonded to four different groups. Benzophenone has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, thus it does not show optical isomerism on its own.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans* isomer of an alkene. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it does not exhibit optical isomerism. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to analyze each structure for chirality.

The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Let's analyze the structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of a center of inversion (or a plane of symmetry) makes the molecule achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some allenes and atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Let's analyze each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This occurs when the rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted due to steric hindrance from large substituents at the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are occupied by bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). This bulkiness prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar, and the free rotation around the central C-C bond is hindered.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a twisted conformation. This twisted structure does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to hindered rotation (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:** We look for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 atom is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group.\n    *   More importantly, a plane of symmetry can be found. Imagine a plane that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. This plane divides the molecule into two identical halves.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is an achiral molecule. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: **Shows optical isomerism** (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: **Shows optical isomerism** (has a chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: **Does not show optical isomerism** (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: **Does not show optical isomerism** (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A molecule's chirality can arise from several features, most commonly a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a biphenyl compound. The bond connecting the two phenyl rings can theoretically rotate. However, there are large, bulky substituents (nitro groups and methoxycarbonyl groups) at all four positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups clash with each other, severely restricting rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Because the rings are forced out of plane and cannot freely rotate to become planar, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is locked in a chiral conformation. As a result, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine if it's chiral, we look for a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group and is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric; it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and do not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property arises from molecular chirality, meaning the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Due to the large, bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to chirality if the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. Since the substitution pattern on the rings prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are inherently chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone, (C6H5)2CO, is a diphenyl ketone. This molecule possesses elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. It does not contain any chiral centers. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. While it can exhibit induced optical activity in specific environments, such as when forming a complex, the molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. Its structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Analysis of the Organic Moieties for Optical Isomerism:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.

Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are occupied by large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of showing optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups. Since this carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls), it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and its overall structure is planar. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images. This property is typically observed in molecules that are chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and ester groups) at all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, eliminates the plane of symmetry that would otherwise make the molecule superimposable on its mirror image. Consequently, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule possesses a chiral center. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a stereocenter, rendering the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group in the solid state, in solution, there is free rotation around the single bonds. The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar with respect to the carbon-carbon double bond and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial, planar, or helical chirality**, which arises from the overall shape of the molecule, even without a specific chiral atom. A common example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At positions 2 and 2': methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3)\n    *   At positions 6 and 6': nitro groups (-NO2)\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large and bulky. This bulkiness creates significant steric hindrance, which restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. Because rotation is hindered, the two rings are forced to be non-coplanar. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized as it is part of a C=O double bond. It is only bonded to three entities (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond.\n*   **Chirality:** Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has a C=C double bond, and the carbons involved are sp² hybridized, so they cannot be chiral centers. The molecule has a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, it has a **center of inversion** (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nAn isomer is a molecule that has the same molecular formula as another molecule but differs in the arrangement of its atoms. These differences can be in the connectivity of the atoms (constitutional isomers) or their spatial arrangement (stereoisomers). Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. Optical isomers, or enantiomers, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A key feature for most optical isomers is the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial or planar chirality, and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at the ortho positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, thus conferring chirality and optical activity.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at the 2-position) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a stereocenter, or chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Individual benzophenone molecules are achiral and therefore do not exhibit optical isomerism. While it can form chiral crystals, the molecule itself is not chiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, rendering it achiral and incapable of optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the moieties that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each structure must be analyzed for elements of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro and carboxylate groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as the two rings are not in the same plane, and the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry. Such compounds can be resolved into enantiomers.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active (unless in a racemic mixture).\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl groups and one oxygen atom). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and, therefore, optically inactive. While some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be made chiral, benzophenone itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a planar molecule that possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry. It has no chiral centers and is achiral, thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\nThis molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Such compounds can be resolved into optically active enantiomers. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nAlso known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (at position 2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture). This compound exists as two distinct enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone:**\nBenzophenone's structure consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore cannot be optically active. While certain complex derivatives of benzophenone can be made chiral, benzophenone itself is achiral.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate:**\nThis molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Geometric isomerism (*cis*/*trans*) is present, but it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds that exhibit optical isomerism are dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nOptical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. For the molecule to be chiral, rotation must be restricted, and each ring must be unsymmetrically substituted such that the molecule as a whole does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar. Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked in a chiral conformation. It does not have a plane of symmetry, and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is diphenyl ketone, (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid.

(It does show *geometric* isomerism, but not optical isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in such compounds due to restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') sterically hinder free rotation. This restriction can create two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism. Due to this chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R) and (S) forms) and is, therefore, optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone, (C6H5)2CO, features a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral, meaning they are superimposable on their mirror images and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid ester. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is, therefore, achiral and not optically active. Its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), has a plane of symmetry and is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, often seen in substituted biphenyls).\n2.  **Examine Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):** This is a biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can be chiral if there are bulky groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) and the ester groups (-COOCH3) at all four ortho positions are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. This lack of rotation forces the rings into different planes, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism (this specific type is called atropisomerism).\n3.  **Examine Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n4.  **Examine Compound 3 (benzophenone):** The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C6H5). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n5.  **Examine Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):** This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule that is planar or has a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds to determine if they exhibit optical isomerism.\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each compound for optical isomerism:\")\n\n    # Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n    # This is a substituted biphenyl.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial/planar chirality in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. All four ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   For substituted biphenyls, we need to check for a specific type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This arises when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted due to steric hindrance from large substituents at the ortho positions.\n    *   The substituents here (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to prevent free rotation at room temperature.\n    *   With rotation restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar arrangement.\n    *   We must then check if this fixed, non-planar molecule is chiral. A substituted biphenyl is chiral if it does not possess a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substitution pattern (nitro at 6/6' and ester at 2/2') ensures the molecule is asymmetric. It does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to hindered rotation (axial chirality) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   We should look for chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms). A carbon atom is a chiral center if it is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as R and S enantiomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the center of the C=C double bond. If you trace a line from any atom through this center, you will find an identical atom at an equal distance on the other side.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a center of inversion (and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule) makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are:\n1.  The presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of axial chirality, as seen in some allenes and hindered biphenyls (atropisomers).\nA key test for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these symmetry elements, it is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are bulky nitro groups (-NO2) and methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho-substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 group at one ortho position and a -NO2 group at the other). Because the molecule is chiral, it can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as diphenylmethanone, its formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It features a central carbonyl group bonded to two identical phenyl groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane containing the C=O group, the molecule possesses a C2 rotational axis along the C=O bond. Crucially, it also has a plane of symmetry that contains this C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans-configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond (E isomer). The formula is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, there is a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements (both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion) makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds **1** (due to atropisomerism) and **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the analysis of the molecules and the information gathered from the search results, here is the determination for each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. For optical isomerism due to a chiral carbon, the carbon must be bonded to four different groups. This is not the case for benzophenone. The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism in its ground state. While benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. Its structure is symmetrical, and the molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 are capable of showing optical isomerism. Compound 1 exhibits atropisomerism, and compound 2 has a chiral center. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a type of biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is caused by bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') have large substituents (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups). These bulky groups prevent the rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image forms called enantiomers. Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and it is also known as methyl lactate. Its central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active, meaning they can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to two phenyl groups. Because the two phenyl groups are identical, there is no chiral center. The molecule possesses planes of symmetry and is therefore achiral. As a result, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene, with two methyl ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, which means it is an achiral molecule. Consequently, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each structure must be analyzed for chirality. Optical isomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This property is known as chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern makes the molecule asymmetric (it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion), it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and therefore chiral. Thus, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. To determine if it is chiral, we examine the carbon atom at position 2. This carbon is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. While the individual molecule is not chiral, benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral form, meaning the arrangement of molecules in the crystal lattice is chiral. However, the question refers to the optical isomerism of the organic moiety (the molecule itself), which is achiral and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution or as an individual molecule.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer of a substituted alkene. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine if it can exhibit optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n3.  Specific structural features like **axial chirality** (e.g., in substituted biphenyls, allenes) or planar chirality, which lead to non-superimposable mirror images even without a chiral center.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative.

The substituents are nitro groups (-NO₂) and methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The large size of these ortho substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Because of this steric hindrance, the rings are forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, making it chiral. This is an example of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when the molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, twisted (non-coplanar) conformation. In this twisted state, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule's structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine its chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (the *trans*-isomer). The molecule is planar because of the C=C double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Furthermore, this molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nOnly compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A, which includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.

Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, but it can also arise from an axis of chirality, as seen in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to the biphenyl class of compounds. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by the presence of large, bulky substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. This hindered rotation locks the molecule in a non-planar conformation, making it chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. This compound exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, passing through the carbonyl group. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Although it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each must be assessed for chirality, which is the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. However, in this specific molecule, all four positions adjacent to this single bond (the ortho positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (two nitro groups and two methoxycarbonyl groups). This steric hindrance severely restricts rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond. Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule cannot easily become planar and lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. To determine its chirality, we examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable, and thus it is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since this carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses planes of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. However, it's worth noting that some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be forced into a chiral conformation, but benzophenone itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with methoxycarbonyl groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (*cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is an analysis of each compound for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in biphenyls if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. For atropisomerism to be observed, the substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') must be bulky enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely. In this compound, all four ortho positions are occupied by large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups), which creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern is not symmetrical in a way that would create a plane of symmetry within the molecule, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture). The presence of this chiral carbon means that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers (mirror images) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a center of chirality, a carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups. Since the central carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups, and since two of those groups (the phenyl rings) are identical, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism. While some heavily substituted benzophenones can be made to be chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond restricts rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (*cis*/*trans*), but not necessarily optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism.

Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, causes the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral, leading to optical isomerism. The molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The carbon atom at the 2-position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. This molecule is symmetrical; it possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the carbonyl group. Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While benzophenone itself is achiral, it can be a part of a larger chiral molecule or form chiral crystals.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we need to analyze each structure for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common sources of chirality are chiral centers (an atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This is a biphenyl molecule. The bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance.\n    *   This hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   Because rotation is locked, the rings are held in a non-planar arrangement. The molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the central carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   The structure is `C6H5-CO-C6H5`.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical. It has a C2 axis of rotation passing through the carbonyl group. It also has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of an alkene: `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`.\n    *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion.\n    *   Because it possesses elements of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.

A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and thus optically active (unless it is part of a meso compound, which is not the case here).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This lack of superimposability is typically due to the presence of a chiral element, such as a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or an axis of chirality (as in atropisomers). Molecules that possess an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Both rings are heavily substituted at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') with large groups: two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups and two nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the steric bulk of these four ortho substituents, the free rotation around the central C-C single bond is severely hindered. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We must check for stereocenters. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains no chiral centers. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the double-bonded carbons. It has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and, more definitively, a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Optically active\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Optically active\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Not optically active\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (center of inversion, plane of symmetry) -> Not optically active\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\nThis molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as substituted biphenyls. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable, non-planar conformation where the two rings are twisted relative to each other. If the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it will be chiral and thus optically active. In this specific molecule, the substitution pattern prevents the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image, resulting in the existence of two enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nThis compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is defined as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are inherently chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone:**\nThe chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings. Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O group and the bond connecting the two rings, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. While some highly substituted benzophenone derivatives can be made chiral, the parent molecule is not.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate:**\nDimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond in the molecule prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the *trans* configuration of dimethyl fumarate gives the molecule a center of symmetry. A molecule with a center of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule's structure must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. In biphenyl derivatives, if the substituent groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are bulky enough, they will hinder free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can make the molecule chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry. In this specific molecule, the large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups in all four ortho positions prevent the rings from becoming coplanar, thus eliminating any plane of symmetry and making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this compound's structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule is not chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Although some highly substituted benzophenones can be made chiral, the parent benzophenone molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this trans configuration, the molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nBased on the initial analysis and the search results, here is a breakdown of each compound's potential for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    This compound is a biphenyl derivative. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This typically happens when there are large, bulky groups in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from freely rotating and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation leads to a chiral axis, and the molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making it optically active.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at the 2-position) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:**\n    Benzophenone has a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because the two phenyl groups are identical, there are no chiral centers in the molecule. Although individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, they can freely interconvert with their mirror image at room temperature, making the compound achiral and optically inactive as a whole. While some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be resolved, and achiral benzophenone can form chiral crystals, the isolated molecule itself is not optically active.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    Dimethyl fumarate is the trans-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active. While it is a stereoisomer (a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate shows optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n*   Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.\n*   Benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the moieties that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like axial chirality (in atropisomers) or planar chirality.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond. In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky groups at the ortho positions sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. Because of this hindrance, the two phenyl rings cannot lie in the same plane. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atoms to find a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since C2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms).

A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. There are no chiral centers. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral.

Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where two benzene rings are linked by a single C-C bond. All four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The presence of large substituents at all four ortho positions severely restricts the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called hindered rotation. Because of this, the two rings cannot lie in the same plane (they are not coplanar). The molecule adopts a twisted, stable conformation. This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements is chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   An atom bonded to four distinct groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it is a chiral molecule and shows optical isomerism. It can exist as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as diphenyl ketone, its structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. While the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nA molecule exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Rotation about the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted due to the presence of bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). This restricted rotation, known as steric hindrance, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** In this fixed, non-planar conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Consequently, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality arising from hindered rotation about a single bond is called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine if it's chiral, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one carrying the -OH group).\n*   **The four groups attached to this carbon are:**\n    1.  Hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  Hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  Methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  Methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three entities, so it cannot be a chiral center.\n*   **Chirality:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  **A chiral center (or stereocenter):** Typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Axial, planar, or helical chirality:** Chirality that arises from the arrangement of groups around an axis or a plane, without a specific chiral atom. A key example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls where bulky groups restrict rotation around the central single bond.\nA molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound based on these principles.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond. The ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions have bulky substituents, rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Due to this restricted rotation, the two phenyl rings are locked in a non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Consequently, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** Benzophenone, or diphenylmethanone, has the formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. Two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers. The double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls that have bulky groups in the ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) experience hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. If the substitution pattern also removes planes of symmetry, the molecule can exist as non-superimposable mirror images known as atropisomers. In this molecule, the nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions are large enough to prevent free rotation. This restricted rotation, combined with the substitution pattern, results in axial chirality, making the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's central carbon atom (at the 2-position) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active. Methyl lactate exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone features a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The carbon atom of the carbonyl group is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two carbon atoms of the phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It lacks a chiral center. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral arrangement, but as an individual molecule, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral and, therefore, not optically active. While it can react to form chiral products, the molecule itself is non-chiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property can arise from a chiral center or from axial chirality, as seen in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Optical isomerism can occur in substituted biphenyls if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction, called atropisomerism, happens when large, bulky groups are present at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the bond linking the rings). In this specific molecule, the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation, leading to a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule, also known as methyl lactate, is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. The second carbon atom in this molecule is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since these four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules containing a chiral center are optically active. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two non-superimposable mirror images, the (R) and (S) enantiomers, and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a carbon to be a chiral center, it must be bonded to four different groups. Since this is not the case, benzophenone does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive. While it's possible for highly substituted benzophenones to be chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this trans geometry, the molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound exhibits a form of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and ester groups) at all four ortho-positions of the biphenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, combined with an appropriate substitution pattern, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, making it chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a chiral center. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** This molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6,6' and 2,2' respectively), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a carbon atom (the second carbon of the propanoate chain) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly associated with the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like axial chirality, while lacking elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The single bond connecting the two phenyl rings can have restricted rotation if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'). In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them in a non-planar conformation. This phenomenon, known as atropisomerism, results in axial chirality, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). Since C2 is bonded to four distinct substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings. It is sp2 hybridized and trigonal planar. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial/planar chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond. The ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions are substituted with large enough groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings is prevented. This is called restricted rotation.\n    *   The substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to hinder rotation, forcing the two phenyl rings to be non-coplanar. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond.\n    *   We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are not arranged symmetrically. It also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Due to restricted rotation and the lack of symmetry elements, the molecule is chiral. This type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone, with the structure (C6H5)-C(=O)-(C6H5).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized. We need to check for overall molecular symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, show geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. It has two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyl compounds, if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Since each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -NO2 group and a -COOCH3 group), the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which is a sufficient condition for it to be achiral. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism in biphenyls can arise from a phenomenon called atropisomerism, which occurs when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is typically caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are occupied by large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a stable, chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, meaning they are enantiomers and the compound will exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), thus exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a carbon atom with four different substituents. The molecule itself is achiral; while it can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule is not chiral in solution or gas phases. It possesses a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. It has a double bond and is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism, which is due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation occurs when there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two different, non-superimposable mirror-image forms (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers, which are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral form, but the molecule itself is not optically active in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond in the center of the molecule prevents free rotation. The molecule has a center of symmetry and is planar. Due to these symmetry elements, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism in the Given Compounds:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. For a biphenyl to be chiral, there must be bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this case, the nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃) at the 6,6' and 2,2' positions, respectively, are bulky enough to prevent rotation. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms) and is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a double bond, which restricts rotation, leading to geometrical isomerism (cis/trans). However, dimethyl fumarate itself is a symmetrical molecule. It has a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism.

This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n        *   **Symmetry Check:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism), which arises from restricted rotation around a single bond. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the connecting single bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by large, bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality:** Due to the large size of these ortho substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:** All four positions adjacent to the linking bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of these large groups at all four *ortho* positions creates significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., a -COOCH3 at position 2 and a -NO2 at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   This combination of restricted rotation and lack of symmetry results in a type of chirality known as **axial chirality**, and the resulting isomers are called **atropisomers**.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a simple aromatic ketone with the formula (C6H5)2C=O. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized (part of a double bond) and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral.\n\nThus, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be analyzed for sources of chirality. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism if rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. For atropisomerism to lead to optical activity, two conditions must be met: the rotation around the central single bond must be restricted, and the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. In this specific compound, all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are substituted with bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the biphenyl linkage. The substitution pattern is asymmetric, meaning the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. Therefore, it can be resolved into enantiomers and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. Optical isomerism in this type of molecule typically arises from the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active. It exists as two optical isomers, L- and D-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure features a carbon-carbon double bond. The two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), it is not optically active. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is achiral. Therefore, it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) or are diastereomers that are also chiral. A key feature for many optically active molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a twisted, stable conformation. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (C2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since it is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls) and the two phenyl groups are identical, it does not have a chiral center. The molecule itself is achiral and therefore does not exhibit optical isomerism. While individual molecules can be twisted in a crystal lattice to form a chiral crystal, the molecule itself in a non-crystalline state is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It has a double bond which prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its stereoisomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of atropisomer. Atropisomers are stereoisomers that result from hindered rotation around a single bond. In this biphenyl derivative, the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict the rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific conformation. If this conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image, thus exhibiting optical isomerism. The substitution pattern in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate leads to a chiral molecule.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a stereocenter. The carbon at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, chiral conformation in a crystal lattice, in solution, the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule is considered achiral on average. It does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nOptical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chirality often arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation in certain molecules (atropisomerism). A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation, locking the molecule into a specific twisted conformation.\n    *   Furthermore, each ring is asymmetrically substituted (e.g., ring 1 has a -COOCH₃ at C2 and a -NO₂ at C6). This lack of symmetry within the rings, combined with the restricted rotation, makes the molecule chiral. It lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   Molecules that are chiral due to hindered rotation are called atropisomers. Since this molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate)**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        3.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups.\n    *   The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (the double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized).\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis* isomer).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nThe correct option is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each of the specified organic moieties:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in biphenyl compounds when there is restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, happens when there are large, bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this case, the nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions are large enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely. This creates two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), meaning the compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, the central carbon atom (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active (with the exception of meso compounds, which is not applicable here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has two optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: In this molecule, the central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) and is also bonded to two phenyl groups. Because this carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, it is sp2 hybridized and has a trigonal planar geometry. To exhibit optical isomerism based on a chiral center, an atom typically must be sp3 hybridized and bonded to four different groups. Benzophenone has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, thus it does not show optical isomerism on its own.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans* isomer of an alkene. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it does not exhibit optical isomerism. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to analyze each structure for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This specific type of chirality is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Let's analyze the structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some allenes and atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Let's analyze each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule where the two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:** Substituted biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This occurs when the rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted due to steric hindrance from large substituents at the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are occupied by bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). This bulkiness prevents the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar, and the free rotation around the central C-C bond is hindered.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a twisted conformation. This twisted structure does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to hindered rotation (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:** We look for a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 atom is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis for Chirality:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group.\n    *   More importantly, a plane of symmetry can be found. Imagine a plane that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. This plane divides the molecule into two identical halves.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, benzophenone is an achiral molecule.

A molecule's chirality can arise from several features, most commonly a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a biphenyl compound. The bond connecting the two phenyl rings can theoretically rotate. However, there are large, bulky substituents (nitro groups and methoxycarbonyl groups) at all four positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups clash with each other, severely restricting rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Because the rings are forced out of plane and cannot freely rotate to become planar, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is locked in a chiral conformation. As a result, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine if it's chiral, we look for a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group and is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric; it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and do not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property arises from molecular chirality, meaning the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Due to the large, bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to chirality if the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. Since the substitution pattern on the rings prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are inherently chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone, (C6H5)2CO, is a diphenyl ketone. This molecule possesses elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. It does not contain any chiral centers. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. While it can exhibit induced optical activity in specific environments, such as when forming a complex, the molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. Its structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n### Analysis of the Organic Moieties for Optical Isomerism:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are occupied by large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of showing optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups. Since this carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls), it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and its overall structure is planar. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images.

This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, eliminates the plane of symmetry that would otherwise make the molecule superimposable on its mirror image. Consequently, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule possesses a chiral center. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a stereocenter, rendering the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The benzophenone molecule consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group in the solid state, in solution, there is free rotation around the single bonds. The molecule possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar with respect to the carbon-carbon double bond and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial, planar, or helical chirality**, which arises from the overall shape of the molecule, even without a specific chiral atom. A common example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system.

The substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are large and bulky. This bulkiness creates significant steric hindrance, which restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. Because rotation is hindered, the two rings are forced to be non-coplanar. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone:**\nBenzophenone's structure consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore cannot be optically active. While certain complex derivatives of benzophenone can be made chiral, benzophenone itself is achiral.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate:**\nThis molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Geometric isomerism (*cis*/*trans*) is present, but it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds that exhibit optical isomerism are dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nOptical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. For the molecule to be chiral, rotation must be restricted, and each ring must be unsymmetrically substituted such that the molecule as a whole does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar. Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule is locked in a chiral conformation. It does not have a plane of symmetry, and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is diphenyl ketone, (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (It does show *geometric* isomerism, but not optical isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in such compounds due to restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') sterically hinder free rotation. This restriction can create two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism. Due to this chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R) and (S) forms) and is, therefore, optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone, (C6H5)2CO, features a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral, meaning they are superimposable on their mirror images and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid ester. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is, therefore, achiral and not optically active. Its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), has a plane of symmetry and is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, often seen in substituted biphenyls).\n2.  **Examine Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):** This is a biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can be chiral if there are bulky groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) and the ester groups (-COOCH3) at all four ortho positions are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. This lack of rotation forces the rings into different planes, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism (this specific type is called atropisomerism).\n3.  **Examine Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n4.  **Examine Compound 3 (benzophenone):** The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C6H5). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n5.  **Examine Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):** This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule that is planar or has a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds to determine if they exhibit optical isomerism.\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each compound for optical isomerism:\")\n\n    # Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n    # This is a substituted biphenyl.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial/planar chirality in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. All four ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   For substituted biphenyls, we need to check for a specific type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This arises when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted due to steric hindrance from large substituents at the ortho positions.\n    *   The substituents here (-NO2 and -COOCH3) are bulky enough to prevent free rotation at room temperature.\n    *   With rotation restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar arrangement.\n    *   We must then check if this fixed, non-planar molecule is chiral. A substituted biphenyl is chiral if it does not possess a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substitution pattern (nitro at 6/6' and ester at 2/2') ensures the molecule is asymmetric. It does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to hindered rotation (axial chirality) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   We should look for chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms). A carbon atom is a chiral center if it is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as R and S enantiomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the center of the C=C double bond. If you trace a line from any atom through this center, you will find an identical atom at an equal distance on the other side.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a center of inversion (and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule) makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for a molecule to be chiral are:\n1.  The presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of axial chirality, as seen in some allenes and hindered biphenyls (atropisomers).\nA key test for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). If a molecule possesses either of these symmetry elements, it is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are bulky nitro groups (-NO2) and methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The large size of these ortho-substituents creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -COOCH3 group at one ortho position and a -NO2 group at the other). Because the molecule is chiral, it can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl-2-hydroxypropanoate. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as diphenylmethanone, its formula is (C6H5)2C=O. It features a central carbonyl group bonded to two identical phenyl groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane containing the C=O group, the molecule possesses a C2 rotational axis along the C=O bond. Crucially, it also has a plane of symmetry that contains this C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans-configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond (E isomer). The formula is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, there is a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements (both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion) makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds **1** (due to atropisomerism) and **2** (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the analysis of the molecules and the information gathered from the search results, here is the determination for each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. For optical isomerism due to a chiral carbon, the carbon must be bonded to four different groups. This is not the case for benzophenone. The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism in its ground state. While benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral form, the individual molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene. Its structure is symmetrical, and the molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 are capable of showing optical isomerism. Compound 1 exhibits atropisomerism, and compound 2 has a chiral center. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a type of biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is caused by bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') have large substituents (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups). These bulky groups prevent the rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image forms called enantiomers. Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and it is also known as methyl lactate. Its central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active, meaning they can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to two phenyl groups. Because the two phenyl groups are identical, there is no chiral center. The molecule possesses planes of symmetry and is therefore achiral. As a result, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene, with two methyl ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, which means it is an achiral molecule. Consequently, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each structure must be analyzed for chirality. Optical isomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This property is known as chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern makes the molecule asymmetric (it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion), it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and therefore chiral. Thus, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. To determine if it is chiral, we examine the carbon atom at position 2. This carbon is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. While the individual molecule is not chiral, benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral form, meaning the arrangement of molecules in the crystal lattice is chiral. However, the question refers to the optical isomerism of the organic moiety (the molecule itself), which is achiral and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution or as an individual molecule.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer of a substituted alkene. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine if it can exhibit optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n3.  Specific structural features like **axial chirality** (e.g., in substituted biphenyls, allenes) or planar chirality, which lead to non-superimposable mirror images even without a chiral center.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO₂) and methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The large size of these ortho substituents prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond connecting them. This restricted rotation is called **atropisomerism**. Because of this steric hindrance, the rings are forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, making it chiral. This is an example of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon atom is a **chiral center**. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized as it is part of a double bond. It is bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). Therefore, it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar due to the rigid C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a **plane of symmetry**. Furthermore, it has a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when the molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, twisted (non-coplanar) conformation. In this twisted state, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule's structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine its chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. Two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (the *trans*-isomer). The molecule is planar because of the C=C double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Furthermore, this molecule possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nOnly compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A, which includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n    *   It has bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃) at all four positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   This significant steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation, combined with the asymmetric substitution on each ring, means the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. It lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the molecule.\n    *   Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry is achiral and thus cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property arises from chirality, which means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, but it can also arise from an axis of chirality, as seen in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to the biphenyl class of compounds. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by the presence of large, bulky substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. This hindered rotation locks the molecule in a non-planar conformation, making it chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. This compound exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. It possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, passing through the carbonyl group. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Although it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each must be assessed for chirality, which is the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds called biphenyls. Normally, there is free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. However, in this specific molecule, all four positions adjacent to this single bond (the ortho positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (two nitro groups and two methoxycarbonyl groups). This steric hindrance severely restricts rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond. Due to this restricted rotation, the molecule cannot easily become planar and lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. To determine its chirality, we examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable, and thus it is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since this carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses planes of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. However, it's worth noting that some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be forced into a chiral conformation, but benzophenone itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with methoxycarbonyl groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these symmetry elements, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (*cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is an analysis of each compound for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in biphenyls if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. For atropisomerism to be observed, the substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') must be bulky enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely. In this compound, all four ortho positions are occupied by large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups), which creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern is not symmetrical in a way that would create a plane of symmetry within the molecule, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture). The presence of this chiral carbon means that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers (mirror images) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a center of chirality, a carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups. Since the central carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups, and since two of those groups (the phenyl rings) are identical, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism. While some heavily substituted benzophenones can be made to be chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond restricts rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (*cis*/*trans*), but not necessarily optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism.

Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, causes the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral, leading to optical isomerism. The molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial chirality:** Restricted rotation about a single bond, leading to a non-superimposable mirror image (atropisomerism), often seen in substituted biphenyls.\nA key test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond. The ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The bulky groups at the ortho positions (6, 6', 2, 2') cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Now, we must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. If you try to pass a plane through the molecule, the arrangement of substituents will not be a mirror image of each other.\n    *   The molecule also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Since rotation is hindered and the molecule is asymmetric, it is chiral. This specific type of chirality is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atoms for any chiral centers. We focus on Carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   Carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and thus optically active (unless it is part of a meso compound, which is not the case here).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp² hybridized (bonded to only three atoms), and all carbons in the phenyl rings are also sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two methoxycarbonyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers. The carbons in the C=C double bond are sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses several elements of symmetry. Most notably, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Inverting any atom through this point will land it on an identical atom.\n    *   A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: **Yes**, shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: **Yes**, shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: **No**, it is achiral.\n*   Compound 4: **No**, it is achiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nTo determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This lack of superimposability is typically due to the presence of a chiral element, such as a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or an axis of chirality (as in atropisomers). Molecules that possess an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i) are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. Both rings are heavily substituted at the ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') with large groups: two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups and two nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the steric bulk of these four ortho substituents, the free rotation around the central C-C single bond is severely hindered. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. In this conformation, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, which is a type of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We must check for stereocenters. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains no chiral centers. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the double-bonded carbons. It has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and, more definitively, a **center of inversion** located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Optically active\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Optically active\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Not optically active\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (center of inversion, plane of symmetry) -> Not optically active\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\nThis molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as substituted biphenyls. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable, non-planar conformation where the two rings are twisted relative to each other. If the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it will be chiral and thus optically active. In this specific molecule, the substitution pattern prevents the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image, resulting in the existence of two enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nThis compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is defined as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are inherently chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone:**\nThe chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings. Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O group and the bond connecting the two rings, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. While some highly substituted benzophenone derivatives can be made chiral, the parent molecule is not.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate:**\nDimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond in the molecule prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the *trans* configuration of dimethyl fumarate gives the molecule a center of symmetry. A molecule with a center of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule's structure must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound is a substituted biphenyl. In biphenyl derivatives, if the substituent groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are bulky enough, they will hinder free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can make the molecule chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry. In this specific molecule, the large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups in all four ortho positions prevent the rings from becoming coplanar, thus eliminating any plane of symmetry and making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this compound's structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule is not chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. Although some highly substituted benzophenones can be made chiral, the parent benzophenone molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this trans configuration, the molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nBased on the initial analysis and the search results, here is a breakdown of each compound's potential for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    This compound is a biphenyl derivative. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This typically happens when there are large, bulky groups in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from freely rotating and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation leads to a chiral axis, and the molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making it optically active.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at the 2-position) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:**\n    Benzophenone has a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because the two phenyl groups are identical, there are no chiral centers in the molecule. Although individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, they can freely interconvert with their mirror image at room temperature, making the compound achiral and optically inactive as a whole. While some heavily substituted benzophenone derivatives can be resolved, and achiral benzophenone can form chiral crystals, the isolated molecule itself is not optically active.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    Dimethyl fumarate is the trans-isomer of a butenedioic acid ester. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is not optically active. While it is a stereoisomer (a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate shows optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n*   Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.\n*   Benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the moieties that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like axial chirality (in atropisomers) or planar chirality.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings linked by a single C-C bond. In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky groups at the ortho positions sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. Because of this hindrance, the two phenyl rings cannot lie in the same plane. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making it chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atoms to find a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since C2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms). Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as diphenylmethanone, its structure is C6H5-CO-C6H5. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule. There are no chiral centers. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does have a geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate, but this is a different type of isomerism).\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n    Therefore, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where two benzene rings are linked by a single C-C bond. All four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The presence of large substituents at all four ortho positions severely restricts the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called hindered rotation. Because of this, the two rings cannot lie in the same plane (they are not coplanar). The molecule adopts a twisted, stable conformation. This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements is chiral. This specific type of chirality arising from restricted rotation is known as **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound is the methyl ester of lactic acid. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   An atom bonded to four distinct groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, it is a chiral molecule and shows optical isomerism. It can exist as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as diphenyl ketone, its structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. While the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nA molecule exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral.

Rotation about the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted due to the presence of bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). This restricted rotation, known as steric hindrance, locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** In this fixed, non-planar conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Consequently, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality arising from hindered rotation about a single bond is called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are:\n1.  **A chiral center (or stereocenter):** Typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Axial, planar, or helical chirality:** Chirality that arises from the arrangement of groups around an axis or a plane, without a specific chiral atom. A key example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls where bulky groups restrict rotation around the central single bond.\nA molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound based on these principles.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond. The ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions have bulky substituents, rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Due to this restricted rotation, the two phenyl rings are locked in a non-planar (twisted) conformation. This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Consequently, its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of chirality is known as axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** Benzophenone, or diphenylmethanone, has the formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. Two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no chiral centers. The double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (axial chirality).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls that have bulky groups in the ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) experience hindered rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. If the substitution pattern also removes planes of symmetry, the molecule can exist as non-superimposable mirror images known as atropisomers. In this molecule, the nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions are large enough to prevent free rotation. This restricted rotation, combined with the substitution pattern, results in axial chirality, making the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule's central carbon atom (at the 2-position) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center (or stereocenter). Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active. Methyl lactate exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone features a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings. The carbon atom of the carbonyl group is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two carbon atoms of the phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It lacks a chiral center. While individual benzophenone molecules are achiral, they can crystallize in a chiral arrangement, but as an individual molecule, it is not optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral and, therefore, not optically active. While it can react to form chiral products, the molecule itself is non-chiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property can arise from a chiral center or from axial chirality, as seen in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Optical isomerism can occur in substituted biphenyls if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction, called atropisomerism, happens when large, bulky groups are present at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the bond linking the rings). In this specific molecule, the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation, leading to a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule, also known as methyl lactate, is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. The second carbon atom in this molecule is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since these four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules containing a chiral center are optically active. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two non-superimposable mirror images, the (R) and (S) enantiomers, and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a carbon to be a chiral center, it must be bonded to four different groups. Since this is not the case, benzophenone does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive. While it's possible for highly substituted benzophenones to be chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this trans geometry, the molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound exhibits a form of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and ester groups) at all four ortho-positions of the biphenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, combined with an appropriate substitution pattern, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, making it chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a chiral center. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** This molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
