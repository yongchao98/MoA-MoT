At 25% neutralization, the ratio of conjugate base [A-] to acid [HA] is 0.25/0.75, or 1/3. The calculated pH was **4.26**.\n2.  **Calculation at Equivalence Point:** The script calculated the concentration of the acetate conjugate base formed at the equivalence point.

The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is therefore 25/75, or 1/3.\n\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to Reach Equivalence:**\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate at Equivalence Point:**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    The acetate ion reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n*   **Kb Calculation:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:**\n    We can set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming 'x' is very small, we can simplify this to:\n    x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **pH at 25% titration:** 4.26\n*   **pH at the equivalence point:** 8.52\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume × Concentration = 0.02000 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol\n*   **New volume of the solution:**\n    20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2.

Volume of NaOH at Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:** 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n### 4. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Ratio of conjugate base to acid:** At this point, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% remains. The ratio [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   **pKa of acetic acid:** The Ka is given as 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n### 5. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    Initial moles of acid / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:** We use the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.41x10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    x² ≈ (5.41x10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082x10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082x10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n*   **Initial volume of acetic acid (V1):** 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L\n*   **Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1):** 0.05 M\n*   **Volume of water added:** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final volume of diluted acid (V2):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, the new concentration (M2) is:\n    M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, sodium acetate. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):** 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At this point, a buffer solution exists containing the remaining acetic acid and the newly formed acetate (A⁻).\n*   **Moles of HA remaining:** 75% of initial moles = 0.75 * 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   **Moles of A⁻ formed:** 25% of initial moles = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n\nWe use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer solution.\n*   **pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since both species are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles:\n    pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    **pH ≈ 4.25**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, which will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence:** This equals the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate (A⁻):** Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes water as follows: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. To find the pH, we need the Kb of the acetate ion.\n*   **Kb = Kw / Ka** = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48\n    **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately **4.26** (rounding 4.25) at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume of the solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n*   (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\n*   M₂ = (0.05 × 20.00) / 40.00 = 1.00 / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   **Careful Point:** The concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is 0.025 M, not the initial 0.05 M.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n*   Moles of acetic acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n*   Let V_eq be the volume of NaOH at the equivalence point.\n*   Moles of NaOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × V_eq.\n*   0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × V_eq\n*   V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Careful Point:** This volume is essential for calculating the conditions at different stages of the titration.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to base, and 75% remains as acid. The ratio of moles [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.26.\n*   **Careful Point:** In a buffer region, the ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method here.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is: Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, making the solution basic: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We use the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate pOH: pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   Finally, calculate pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 8.52.\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH is greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. Remember to use the total volume to calculate the concentration of this base.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial calculations were correct. The provided Ka for acetic acid (1.85x10⁻⁵) is a commonly accepted value, though slight variations exist (1.76x10⁻⁵, 1.8x10⁻⁵). The pKa is therefore around 4.73-4.76. The steps for calculating the pH at different points in a weak acid-strong base titration are standard and confirmed by multiple sources.\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted by half, resulting in a 0.025 M solution.\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after it is diluted with water. This new concentration is the starting point for the titration.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n**Careful Point:** All subsequent titration calculations must use this diluted concentration (0.025 M) and the corresponding initial volume (40.00 cm³).\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH), forming its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The remaining 75% is unreacted acid. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n*   The pH of a buffer is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[conjugate base] / \\[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the acid is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    **Careful Point:** In a buffer, the ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles, so we can use the percentage directly.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The pH of the solution is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion:**\n    1.  **Initial moles of acid:** 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol.\n    2.  **Volume of NaOH needed:** To neutralize 0.001 mol of acid, the volume of 0.1 M NaOH is: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  **Total volume at equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    4.  **Concentration of acetate:** [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n    **Careful Point:** The concentration of the resulting conjugate base must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solutions.\n*   **Calculate the pH from hydrolysis:**\n    1.  The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    2.  We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    3.  Set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / 0.02\n    4.

Calculate pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    **Careful Point:** The equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always above 7 because the product is a weak base.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point = **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
