It then calculated the theoretical mean decay distance using the principles of special relativity and particle physics. The formula used was $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$, which yielded a value of approximately $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nThis calculated value was used as a constraint to filter the initial hypotheses.

Understand the concepts**\n\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This is a measure of the uncertainty in the energy of an unstable particle, related to its lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It is given in units of energy (MeV in this case).\n*   **Mean Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a particle exists in its own rest frame before decaying. The relationship between decay width and mean lifetime is given by the formula: τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** In special relativity, this factor describes how time, length, and relativistic mass change for a moving object. It is calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (mc²).\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the average distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying. Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer (γτ), and the distance it travels is L = v * (γτ), where v is the particle's velocity. This can be conveniently expressed as L = γβcτ, where β = v/c.\n\n**2.

This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n*   Total energy of the particle X: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle X: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (This implies the rest energy is $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$)\n*   Decay width of the particle X: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### Step 2: Identify Necessary Physical Concepts and Formulas\n1.  **Proper Mean Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is inversely related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. The lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance the particle travels in the lab frame is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Kinematics:**\n    *   The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   The formula for the decay distance can be written as $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   A more direct calculation can be done using the relativistic momentum ($p_X$). The energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed as $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting these into the formula for $L$, we get:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\tau = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        This final formula is very convenient as it uses the given energy/mass values directly and the well-known constant $\\hbar c$.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n**Careful Point:** Ensure all units are consistent.

The decay distance is calculated in the lab frame.\n*   Use the full relativistic expression for the decay distance, $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$, not a non-relativistic approximation or an incorrect simplification like $L = c\\tau$ or $L = \\gamma c\\tau$.\n*   Maintain consistent units throughout the calculation (e.g., convert MeV to GeV).\n*   Using the combined constant $\\hbar c$ simplifies the calculation and reduces rounding errors from using separate values for $\\hbar$ and $c$. The formula $L = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$ is the most efficient for this problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the X meson, we follow these steps:\n\n**1.

Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) and velocity factor ($\\beta$) from the particle's energy and mass.\n3.  Calculate the mean decay distance (L) in the laboratory frame.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime ($\\tau$)**\n\nThe relationship between the decay width ($\\Gamma$) and the mean lifetime ($\\tau$) is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Determine the Relevant Physics Formula:**\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the lab frame is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame ($t_{lab}$).\n$L = v \\cdot t_{lab}$\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor):\n$t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nThe proper lifetime is related to the decay width by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nCombining these, and expressing the velocity as $v = \\beta c$, we get:\n$L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**3.

All units must be converted to a consistent system (e.g., all to GeV or all to MeV) before calculation.\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The particle is highly relativistic (its energy is almost 7 times its rest mass), so using the full relativistic formulas for lifetime and momentum is essential.\n*   **Correct Formula:** The mean decay distance in the lab frame is $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.

Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) describes the time dilation and length contraction for an object moving at relativistic speeds. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\nGiven the production energy E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV and the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV, the Lorentz factor is:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\n**3. Calculate the velocity (β) of the X meson:**\n\nThe velocity of the particle is expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, denoted by β (v/c). It can be calculated from the Lorentz factor using the following relation:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\nRearranging for β, we get:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n**4. Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity (v = βc) during its dilated lifetime (γτ).
