The ratio `(g_excited / g_ground)` is a constant for the specific transition.\n\n2.  **Set up the equations for both stars:**\n    Let T₁ be the temperature of star_1 and T₂ be the temperature of star_2. We can write the excitation ratio for each star:\n\n    *   For star_1: `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   For star_2: `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n    Here, `C` represents the constant ratio of degeneracies `(g_excited / g_ground)`.\n\n3.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out from both sides:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂:** To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\n6.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to match the format of the given options:\n\n    `ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Incorporate the given physical constants:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n    The problem is designed so that this pre-factor becomes unity.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 6 gives the final result:\n\n    `ln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe search results confirm the use of the Boltzmann equation for determining the relative populations of energy levels in stellar atmospheres, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe standard form of the equation is:\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in energy states b and a.\n*   g_b and g_a are the degeneracies of the states.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This can be interpreted as the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (let's call it state 'i') relative to the total number of atoms (N_total) is twice as large for star 1.\n\n(N_i / N_total)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_total)_2\n\nIn many stellar atmospheres, it's a valid approximation to assume that most atoms are in the ground state (state 'g'), so N_total ≈ N_gnd. This simplifies the relationship to:\n\n(N_i / N_gnd)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_gnd)_2\n\nNow, we can apply the Boltzmann equation to each star:\n\nFor star_1: (N_i / N_gnd)_1 = (g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\nFor star_2: (N_i / N_gnd)_2 = (g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nSubstituting these into our ratio equation:\n(g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_gnd) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe degeneracy term (g_i / g_gnd) cancels out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for 2:\n2 = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n2 = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_1 - 1/T_2)]\n2 = exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nCombining the fractions in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\nln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  The problem setup requires comparing the population of an excited state in two different stars.\n2.  The Boltzmann equation is the correct physical principle to use for populations of energy levels in a gas in LTE.\n3.  The interpretation of \"twice as excited\" as a ratio of the fractional population is standard.\n4.  The approximation that the ground state population is nearly equal to the total population is reasonable for this type of problem.\n5.  The algebraic manipulation is correct.\n6.

The distribution of atoms across different energy levels in an LTE system is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (N_j) to a lower state `i` (N_i) is given by:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E_j - E_i).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nLet's define the excitation ratio for each star.

The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_i) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N_0) is given by:\n\n    N_i / N_0 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_0` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n2.  **Applying to Star 1 and Star 2**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1): (N_i / N_0)_1 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2): (N_i / N_0)_2 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n3.  **Using the Observational Data**: The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The correct physical law to apply is the **Boltzmann Equation**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation**: The equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to a lower state (`N_i`) to the temperature (`T`) of the system:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `g_j`/`g_i` is the ratio of statistical weights.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars**: Let's denote the excitation ratio `N_j / N_i` as `R`. We can write the equation for each star:\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T₁): `R₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T₂): `R₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n    (Here, `C` is the constant ratio of statistical weights `g_j / g_i`, which is the same for both stars as it's the same atomic transition).\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Problem's Central Condition**: The problem states that iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n    `R₁ = 2 * R₂`\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify**: Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n    The constant `C` cancels from both sides:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Relationship**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, we get:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\n7.  **Isolate ln(2)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    `ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)`\n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)`\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator `(T₁ * T₂)`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values**: This is a critical step. The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore approximately 1.\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1`\n\n9.  **Determine the Final Equation**: Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 7 gives the final result:\n    `1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)`\n    Which simplifies to:\n    `ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"twice as excited\"**: This correctly means the ratio of populations `R₁` is double `R₂`.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation**: Care must be taken with signs when rearranging the logarithmic equation. The term `-ΔE / (k * T₂)` becomes positive when moved to the other side.\n*   **The `ΔE / k` Factor**: The problem is specifically designed so that this factor simplifies to 1. Forgetting to evaluate this factor would leave an expression that doesn't match any of the options.\n*   **Fraction Subtraction**: The expression `1/T₂ - 1/T₁` correctly combines to `(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)`.\n*   **Matching to Options**: The final derived equation is `ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)`. The candidate answers show confusion in matching this result to the correct letter. However, the mathematical form is unambiguous. This form corresponds to option C in the most complete listings of the options.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation performed by the majority of the agents and verified here, the correct mathematical relationship is clear.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Let's trace the derivation properly:\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of populations (N_j / N_i) for two energy levels is given by:\n    (N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n    where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to Stars:** Let R_1 and R_2 be the excitation ratios for star 1 and star 2.\n    *   R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / kT_1)\n    *   R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / kT_2)\n    (where C is the constant ratio of statistical weights, g_j/g_i)\n\n3.  **Problem Constraint:** We are told the ratio in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n    *   R_1 = 2 * R_2\n    *   C * exp(-ΔE / kT_1) = 2 * C * exp(-ΔE / kT_2)\n\n4.  **Solving for Temperature:**\n    *   Cancel the constant C: `exp(-ΔE / kT_1) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT_2)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln[exp(-ΔE / kT_1)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT_2)]`\n    *   Simplify using log rules: `-ΔE / kT_1 = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / kT_2)]`\n    *   Simplify further: `-ΔE / kT_1 = ln(2) - ΔE / kT_2`\n    *   Isolate ln(2): `ln(2) = ΔE / kT_2 - ΔE / kT_1`\n    *   Factor out the common term (ΔE/k): `ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [1/T_2 - 1/T_1]`\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the bracket: `ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n5.  **Final Constraint:** The problem states ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.

The equation relates the number of atoms in an excited state (N_excited) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N_ground).\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:**\n    N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n    *   g_excited and g_ground are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels, which are constant for a given transition.\n\n3.  **Apply to Both Stars:**\n    Let's write the equation for each star.

First, rearrange the equation:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\n    Using the exponent rule e^a / e^b = e^(a-b):\n    exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n    exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Numerical Values:**\n    The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\n    Calculate the ratio ΔE / k:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    The fact that this ratio is approximately 1 is a key piece of information intended to simplify the final expression.

The ratio `(g_excited / g_ground)` is a constant for the specific transition.\n\n2.  **Set up the equations for both stars:**\n    Let T₁ be the temperature of star_1 and T₂ be the temperature of star_2. We can write the excitation ratio for each star:\n\n    *   For star_1: `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   For star_2: `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n    Here, `C` represents the constant ratio of degeneracies `(g_excited / g_ground)`.\n\n3.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n\n    `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out from both sides:\n\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n5.  **Solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂:** To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\n6.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to match the format of the given options:\n\n    `ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n    `(ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Incorporate the given physical constants:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\n    The problem is designed so that this pre-factor becomes unity.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 6 gives the final result:\n\n    `ln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe search results confirm the use of the Boltzmann equation for determining the relative populations of energy levels in stellar atmospheres, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe standard form of the equation is:\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in energy states b and a.\n*   g_b and g_a are the degeneracies of the states.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 K.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\nln(2) = [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.

The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_i) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N_0) is given by:\n\n    N_i / N_0 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_0` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n2.  **Applying to Star 1 and Star 2**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1): (N_i / N_0)_1 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2): (N_i / N_0)_2 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n3.  **Using the Observational Data**: The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state for star 1 is double that for star 2:\n\n    (N_i / N_0)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_0)_2\n\n4.  **Formulating the Equation**: By substituting the Boltzmann expressions into the observational relationship, we get:\n\n    (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression**: The term for the statistical weights (g_i / g_0) is a property of the iron atom and is the same for both stars, so it cancels out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate the constant '2':\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n\n    exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n6.  **Taking the Natural Logarithm**: To remove the exponential, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n7.  **Using the Given Energy Value**: The problem states the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n8.  **Final Algebraic Step**: Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nExcellent.

This implies that the ratio of the population in the excited state to a lower state is twice as large for star 1 as it is for star 2.\n\nTherefore, we can write the relationship:\n(N_excited / N_lower)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_lower)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n(g_e / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_e / g_l) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe statistical weights (g) are properties of the atom and are the same for both stars, so they cancel out:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate ln(2):\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, has a defined value of approximately 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nBy substituting these values, the ratio (ΔE / k) becomes:\n(ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
