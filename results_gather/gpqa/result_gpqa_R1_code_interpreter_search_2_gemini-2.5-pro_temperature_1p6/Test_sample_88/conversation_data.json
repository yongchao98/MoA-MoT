    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to understand the properties of each product.**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240°C to give Product 1.\n    *   The starting material is a saturated tricyclic haloalkane.\n    *   The reagents are a strong base (KOH) and high temperature.\n    *   Product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n    *   The problem states that Product 1 leads to an ozonolysis product down the line. Ozonolysis cleaves C=C double bonds. Therefore, Product 1 must contain a C=C double bond in addition to the C=O group.\n    *   Conclusion for Product 1: It is an unsaturated ketone with a C10 skeleton derived from adamantane, likely via skeletal rearrangement due to the harsh conditions. The provided ¹H NMR data (especially the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm, typical for alkene protons) supports the presence of a C=C bond. (Note: The total proton count of 14 in the provided NMR data is inconsistent with a C10 unsaturated ketone, which should be C₁₀H₁₂O. This suggests there might be an error in the problem's data, but the presence of the C=C and C=O groups is the key takeaway).\n\n2.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to give Product 2.\n    *   This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n    *   This reaction reduces a ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The C=C double bond is unaffected.\n    *   Conclusion for Product 2: It is an unsaturated alcohol, corresponding to the reduction of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS) to give Product 3.\n    *   This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n    *   The C=C double bond in Product 2 is cleaved. Each carbon from the double bond becomes a carbonyl group. With reductive workup (DMS), if a carbon of the double bond was bonded to a hydrogen (i.e., part of a CH or CH₂ group), it becomes an aldehyde (-CHO). If it was bonded to two carbons, it becomes a ketone.\n    *   The 2H signal for the alkene in the starting data suggests a symmetrically substituted double bond of the type `R-CH=CH-R`. Cleavage of such a bond would result in two aldehyde groups.\n    *   Conclusion for Product 3: It is the product of cleaving the C=C bond in Product 2. It will contain two new carbonyl groups (likely aldehydes) and the original alcohol group from Product 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the most deshielded proton in Product 3 and its coupling pattern.**\n\n1.  **Identify the most deshielded proton:** Product 3 contains aliphatic protons (on its carbon skeleton, ~1-3 ppm), a proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol (-CHOH, ~3.5-4.5 ppm), and aldehyde protons (-CHO, ~9-10 ppm). The question excludes exchangeable protons (the -OH proton itself). Therefore, the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the aldehyde protons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the possible coupling patterns:** The splitting (coupling pattern) of an aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon (the alpha-carbon). Long-range coupling (over 4 bonds, ⁴J) can also occur, especially in rigid cyclic systems. Let's analyze the choices:\n    *   A) Pentet: Requires coupling to 4 neighboring protons. Impossible for an aldehyde via standard ³J coupling.\n    *   C) Triplet: Requires coupling to 2 protons on the alpha-carbon (a -CH₂- group). The fragment would be `-CH₂-CHO`.\n    *   A doublet (not an option) would require coupling to 1 proton on the alpha-carbon (a -CH- group). The fragment would be `-CH-CHO`.\n    *   B) Doublet of triplets: This complex pattern suggests coupling to two different sets of protons. For an aldehyde proton, this typically arises from:\n        *   ³J coupling to a single proton on the alpha-carbon (giving a **doublet**). This means the fragment starts `...-CH-CHO`.\n        *   ⁴J long-range coupling to two equivalent protons on the beta-carbon (giving a **triplet**), which requires a rigid W-shaped arrangement of the bonds (`H-C-Cα-Cβ-H`).\n        *   This requires the fragment to be **`...-CH₂-CH-CHO`**.\n    *   D) Triplet of triplets: Requires coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons. For an aldehyde, this would imply a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment for the first triplet, and long-range coupling to another `-CH₂-` group. Fragment: `...-CH₂-CH₂-CHO`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate plausibility:** This is a classic organic puzzle. The complex splitting pattern is often the intended answer. The \"doublet of triplets\" is a very specific pattern that points strongly to the `-CH₂-CH-CHO` fragment being present in the final product and held in a rigid conformation. While the exact structure of Product 1 is difficult to determine due to inconsistencies in the provided data, the final coupling pattern can be deduced. The presence of a rigid, rearranged polycyclic skeleton (derived from adamantane) makes the necessary W-conformation for long-range coupling plausible. The aldehyde proton would first be split into a doublet by the alpha-proton (³J), and each peak of the doublet would then be split into a triplet by the two beta-protons (⁴J), resulting in a doublet of triplets.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the aldehyde proton. A \"doublet of triplets\" pattern implies it is adjacent to a CH group and long-range coupled to a CH₂ group in a rigid system. This is a plausible scenario for a molecule derived from the adamantane skeleton.\n\n<<<B>>>"
