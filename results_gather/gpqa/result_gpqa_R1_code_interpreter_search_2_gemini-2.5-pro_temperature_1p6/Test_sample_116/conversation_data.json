    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each molecule to see if it meets this criterion.\n\n*   **Molecule 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a derivative of biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** The positions adjacent to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are called ortho positions. In this molecule, these positions are substituted with large, bulky groups: nitro groups (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** These bulky groups clash with each other, creating significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the free rotation of the two phenyl rings around the central C-C single bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The lack of free rotation forces the two rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). This twisted conformation does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This specific type of chirality arising from restricted rotation is called atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** We need to check for chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    *   The groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methyl ester group)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n*   **Molecule 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Benzophenone has the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and trigonal planar. The two phenyl rings are twisted out of this plane due to steric hindrance. However, the molecule possesses elements of symmetry. Although technically the lowest energy conformation has C₂ symmetry and is chiral, the energy barrier for rotation of the phenyl groups is very low. This means the two enantiomeric \"propeller\" conformations interconvert rapidly at room temperature.\n    *   **Achiral Nature:** Because this interconversion (racemization) is so fast, the enantiomers cannot be isolated. For practical purposes, and in the context of typical organic chemistry questions, benzophenone is considered achiral and does not exhibit optical activity. It does not have stable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Molecule 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (a *trans* configuration).\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. More importantly, it possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you draw a line from any atom through this center and extend it an equal distance on the other side, you find an identical atom.\n    *   **Achiral Nature:** Any molecule that possesses a center of inversion is achiral. An achiral molecule's mirror image is superimposable on the original.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism, as it has a cis-isomer called dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
