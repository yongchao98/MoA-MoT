    "This question is asking for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known in physics as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Identify the concepts and variables:\n\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`.\n*   **Observer:** At a position `r` at time `t`.\n*   **Retarded time (`tr`):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time `tr` when it was at the position `s(tr)`. The time delay `t - tr` is the time it took for the signal to travel from `s(tr)` to `r`.\n*   **Vector `d`:** This is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`.\n    `d = r - s(tr)`\n*   **Distance `d`:** The magnitude of the vector `d`.\n    `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`\n*   **Retarded time condition:** The time delay is the distance divided by the speed of light.\n    `t - tr = d / c`\n*   **Velocity `v`:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    `v = ds(tr) / d(tr)`\n*   **Constants:** `c` (speed of light), `ε₀` (permittivity of free space), `μ₀` (permeability of free space).\n\n### 2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` for a moving point charge are derived from Maxwell's equations. The resulting formulas are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. In standard textbook form, they are:\n\n*   Scalar Potential:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (d - d · v / c))`\n*   Vector Potential:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v / (d - d · v / c))`\n\nThe denominator `(d - d · v / c)` accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, similar to a Doppler effect for light.\n\n### 3. Match with the given options\n\nNow we need to manipulate these standard formulas to match the format of the options provided in the question. The main difference is the form of the denominator.\n\nLet's work on the denominator:\n`d - (d · v) / c`\n\nWe can find a common denominator `c`:\n`= (d * c / c) - (d · v / c)`\n`= (dc - d · v) / c`\n\nNow substitute this back into the potential equations:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential V:**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / ((dc - d · v) / c))`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * (qc / (dc - d · v))`\n    `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀(dc - d · v))`\n\n*   **Vector Potential A:**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v / ((dc - d · v) / c))`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc * v / (dc - d · v))`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀qc * v) / (4π(dc - d · v))`\n\n### 4. Compare with the choices\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r), ...** Incorrect. This is the static potential, which doesn't account for retardation effects.\n*   **B) V(...) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d.v)), A(...) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d.v))** This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n*   **C) V(...) = q / (4πε₀ r), ...** Incorrect. This is the static potential.\n*   **D) V(...) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d.v)), ...** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. The correct derivation yields a `-` sign.\n\n### 5. Consistency Check\n\nA known relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is `A = (v / c²) V`. Let's check if this holds for Option B.\n\nFrom the expressions in Option B:\n`V(r,t) = (qc / (dc - d.v)) * (1 / 4πε₀)`\n`A(r,t) = (qc / (dc - d.v)) * (μ₀ v / 4π)`\n\nLet's find the ratio `A / V`:\n`A / V = [ (qc / (dc - d.v)) * (μ₀ v / 4π) ] / [ (qc / (dc - d.v)) * (1 / 4πε₀) ]`\n`A / V = (μ₀ v / 4π) / (1 / 4πε₀)`\n`A / V = (μ₀ v / 4π) * (4πε₀)`\n`A / V = μ₀ε₀ v`\n\nUsing the relation `c² = 1 / (μ₀ε₀)`, we get:\n`A / V = (1 / c²) * v`\n`A = (v / c²) V`\n\nThe relationship holds, further confirming that Option B is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>"
