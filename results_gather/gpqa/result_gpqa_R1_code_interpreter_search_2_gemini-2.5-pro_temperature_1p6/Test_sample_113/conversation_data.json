    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide), and reagent A.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This addition breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  The alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction by protonating the alkoxide intermediate. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an acidic medium (like dilute HCl or H₂SO₄) which provides the necessary protons. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n    *   **Reactants:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile), reagent B, and water (H₂O).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The problem specifies the addition of reagent B and water.\n        2.  **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄). The nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        3.  **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH), which produces a carboxylate salt. A subsequent acidification step is then required to obtain the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Looking at the options, HCl is a strong acid and CH₃COOH is a weak acid. Strong acids like **HCl** are standard and effective reagents for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. A weak acid like CH₃COOH would be much less effective and slower. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the results.**\n    *   We have determined that A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
