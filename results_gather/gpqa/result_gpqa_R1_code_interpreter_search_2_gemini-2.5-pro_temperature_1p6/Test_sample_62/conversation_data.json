    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:**\n    The problem states the diatomic molecule (XY) is modeled as a quantum rotation-vibration system (non-rigid rotor). The total energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v=0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J=0, 1, 2, ...) is given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = E_v + E_J = ħω(v + 1/2) + BJ(J+1)\n    where:\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule, defined as I = μR², where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\n2.  **Determine the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v=0` and `J=0`.\n    Initial Energy: E_i = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B(0)(0+1) = ħω/2.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final State and Selection Rules:**\n    For a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey quantum mechanical selection rules. For a rotation-vibration transition, the rules are:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n    Starting from the initial state `J=0`, a transition to `J=-1` is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed change in the rotational quantum number is ΔJ = +1, which means the final rotational state must be `J=1`.\n    Thus, the final state after absorbing the photon is `v=1` and `J=1`.\n    Final Energy: E_f = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    ΔE = E_f - E_i\n    ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [ħω/2]\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B\n    This energy represents a transition in the R-branch of the fundamental vibrational band.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    We need to calculate the reduced mass (μ), the moment of inertia (I), and the rotational constant (B) before we can find ΔE.\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu\n        *   My = 2 amu\n        *   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   1 amu = 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        *   ħ = 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) = 2.99792 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   **Calculations:**\n        *   Reduced Mass (μ):\n          μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n          μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0191 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        *   Moment of Inertia (I):\n          I = μR² = (3.0191 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n        *   Rotational Constant (B):\n          B = ħ² / (2I) = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.611 × 10⁻²³ J\n        *   Vibrational Energy Quantum (ħω):\n          ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n6.  **Calculate Photon Energy (ΔE) and Momentum (p):**\n    *   Now, substitute the calculated values back into the equation for ΔE:\n        ΔE = ħω + 2B\n        ΔE ≈ (4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + 2 * (4.611 × 10⁻²³ J)\n        ΔE ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009222 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.2189 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n        (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy, as expected).\n    *   The relationship between a photon's energy (E) and momentum (p) is E = pc. Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\n        p = ΔE / c\n        p ≈ (4.2189 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.99792 × 10⁸ m/s)\n        p ≈ 1.4073 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:**\n    The calculated momentum p ≈ 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s matches option B.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27  # amu to kg conversion factor\nc = 2.99792458e8  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given molecular properties\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR = 2.0e-10    # Bond length in meters\nomega = 4.0e14 # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# 1.

    "To find the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to determine its energy.

Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a rovibrational state is given by E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + BJ(J+1), where `v` is the vibrational quantum number, `J` is the rotational quantum number, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when v=0 and J=0.\n    E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B(0)(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final State:** For a photon to be absorbed and for the molecule to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\", we must apply the selection rules for rovibrational transitions: Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from J=0, a transition to J=-1 (ΔJ = -1) is impossible.\n    *   Therefore, the only allowed transition is Δv = +1 and ΔJ = +1.\n    *   This means the final state is v=1 and J=1.\n    E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**2.
