    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame. We want to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. It's moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The problem states that from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at `v = 60,000 km/s`. By the principle of relativity, an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will also see the ejecta moving towards the center at the same speed, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is called the \"proper time\" because the clock measuring it is at rest in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n\n**3. Determine the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the **Galaxy reference frame (S)**.\n\n**4. Formulate the Physics**\n\n*   The distance traveled in any reference frame is calculated as `distance = velocity × time`.\n*   To find the distance in the Galaxy frame (`d`), we need the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame (`v`) and the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`).\n    `d = v × Δt`\n*   We know `v = 60,000 km/s`. We need to find `Δt`.\n*   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time is relative. The time measured in a stationary frame (`Δt`) is different from the time measured in a moving frame (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called **time dilation**.\n*   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ × Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`. We can use the standard approximation for the speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n*   **Step a: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step b: Calculate (v/c)².**\n    `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nNow, let's find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate Δt using the time dilation formula.**\n    `Δt = γ × Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) × 50 s`\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`).\n\n*   **Step e: Calculate the distance d.**\n    `d = v × Δt = 60,000 km/s × ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) × 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 × 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we will use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000.0  # km/s\n# Use the common approximation for c consistent with the problem's likely design\nc = 300000.0 # km/s\ndt_prime = 50.0 # s (proper time in ejecta's frame)\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(distance_in_galaxy_frame)\n```\n```output\n3061862.17847847\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options and Conclude**\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nOur calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A (`3,060,000 km`). The small difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\nLet's also note that the non-relativistic distance would be `d = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). Since the ejecta is moving at a relativistic speed, the time measured in the Galaxy frame is longer, so the distance covered must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This rules out options B, C, and D. Option A is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the principles involved:** This is a classic problem in special relativity. The core concepts are time dilation and the definition of distance in different inertial reference frames.\n\n2.  **Define the reference frames:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The clock in this frame measures the proper time.\n\n3.  **List the given quantities:**\n    *   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\".\n    *   Speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the goal:** We need to calculate the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n5.  **Formulate the plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   We don't know `Δt` directly. We only know `Δt'`, the time in the ejecta's frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time measured in the ejecta's own frame (`Δt'`).\n    *   The time dilation formula connects these two times: `Δt = γ × Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   So, the full plan is:\n        a. Calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n        b. Use `γ` to find the dilated time, `Δt`.\n        c. Use `Δt` to calculate the distance, `d`.\n\n6.  **Execute the plan (calculations):**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate γ (Lorentz factor).**\n        First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n        Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate Δt (time in the Galaxy frame).**\n        `Δt = γ × Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) × 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate d (distance in the Galaxy frame).**\n        `d = v × Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s × [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) × 50 s ]`\n        `d = (60,000 × 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation and Comparison with Options:**\n    The Python code outputted `3061862.178... km`. Let's compare this with the given options:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A (`3,060,000 km`). The slight discrepancy is common in physics problems where the options are rounded.\n\n    A quick logical check: The relativistic effect of time dilation means that more time passes in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance covered must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance `(60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km)`. This immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, leaving A as the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
