    "*   **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the distinguishability of their energy levels. This directly points to the Heisenberg's Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (τ, which is the uncertainty in time, Δt). The mathematical relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π). A common approximation used in this context is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This ΔE represents the \"energy width\" or the inherent blurriness of the energy level. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy width, making the energy level less precisely defined.\n\n3.  **Calculate the value of ħ in convenient units:** The energy options are given in electron-volts (eV) and the time is in seconds (s). So, we should use the value of ħ in eV·s.\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J\n    *   ħ ≈ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:**\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n5.  **Determine the condition for resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than their intrinsic energy widths. A common and reasonable criterion is that the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be larger than the largest of the two energy widths. An even stricter condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two widths.\n    *   The larger energy width is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The sum of the widths is ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:** We need to find an energy difference option that is greater than the required minimum separation (which is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV).\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This would allow for clear resolution.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷). The energy widths would overlap significantly.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two quantum states, as their intrinsic energy widths due to their finite lifetimes are on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **Computational verification**\nThe following Python script automates the calculations.\n```python\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # s\ntau2 = 1e-8  # s\n\n# Calculate the energy width for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the energy widths.\n# The most significant width is the larger one.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be > {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-11,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor key, val in options.items():\n    print(f\"Option {key}: {val:.1e} eV.

    "The problem revolves around Heisenberg's Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), its energy (E) is not perfectly defined. There is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE) in its energy level. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≈ ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**2. Determine the condition for resolution:**\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" their energy separation (the difference between their central energies, E₁ - E₂) must be larger than their respective energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two \"blurry\" energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\nThe total width of the system can be considered as the sum of the individual widths, or at the very least, it must be larger than the largest individual width. The larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, to clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value.\n\n**3. Evaluate the given options:**\n\nWe need to find the option for the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| that is greater than ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This separation is large enough.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the required separation. The levels would overlap significantly.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required separation. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, given their lifetimes and the resulting energy broadening.\n\n<<<A>>>"
