    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, i.e., `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The problem states to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (total energy radiated per unit time) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = A * σ * T^4`, where `A` is the surface area (`4 * π * R^2`), `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the surface temperature.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body:** The temperature of a black body is related to the peak wavelength (`λ_max`) of its emitted radiation by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max * T = b`, where `b` is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity of a star affects the wavelength of light we observe from it. If a star is moving relative to us, the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) will be different from the wavelength emitted in the star's own rest frame (`λ_emitted`). This effect is described by the Doppler shift formula. Since the velocity (700 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the relativistic formula is more accurate: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`. A positive velocity `v` typically denotes recession (moving away), which causes a redshift (`λ_obs > λ_emitted`).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Step A:** Write down the formula for the luminosity ratio `L1 / L2` using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   **Step B:** Determine the ratio of the stars' temperatures, `T1 / T2`. This will involve using Wien's Law and the Doppler shift formula.\n    *   **Step C:** Combine the results from A and B to calculate the final luminosity ratio.\n\n4.  **Executing the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Luminosity Ratio Formula**\n        From the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n        `L1 = 4 * π * R1^2 * σ * T1^4`\n        `L2 = 4 * π * R2^2 * σ * T2^4`\n        Dividing the two equations, the constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out:\n        `L1 / L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4`\n        The problem gives `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `R1/R2 = 1.5`.\n        `L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4`\n        Now I need to find the temperature ratio, `T1/T2`.\n\n    *   **Step B: Temperature Ratio (`T1/T2`)**\n        From Wien's Law, `T = b / λ_emitted`. Therefore, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their *emitted* peak wavelengths:\n        `T1 / T2 = (b / λ_emitted1) / (b / λ_emitted2) = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1`\n\n        Now, I must relate the *emitted* wavelengths to the *observed* wavelengths. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`.\n\n        *   For Star_1: `v_r1 = 0`. There is no Doppler shift. So, `λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1`.\n        *   For Star_2: `v_r2 = 700 km/s`. This velocity causes a Doppler shift. Assuming recession (redshift), the formula is `λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c))`.\n\n        Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we can set the expressions for them equal:\n        `λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c))`\n\n        Now I can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n        `λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c))`\n\n        So, `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c))`.\n        This makes physical sense: for the observed wavelengths to be the same, the light from the receding Star_2 must have been \"bluer\" (shorter wavelength) when it was emitted. A shorter emitted wavelength means a higher temperature. Therefore, `T2 > T1`, and the ratio `T1/T2` must be less than 1, which my formula gives.\n\n    *   **Step C: Final Calculation**\n        Substitute the expression for `T1/T2` back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4`\n        `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (sqrt((1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c)))^4`\n        `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c))^2`\n\n        Now, I need to plug in the numbers. It's best to use a calculator or a simple script for precision.\n        *   `v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n        *   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 299,792,458 m/s`\n\n        Let me set up a python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nradius_ratio = 1.5\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v_r2 / c\n\n# Calculate the square of the temperature ratio (T1/T2)^2\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))\n# (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))^2\ntemp_ratio_fourth_power = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * temp_ratio_fourth_power\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n2.229033333342352\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately `2.229`. Looking at the options:\n    A) ~2.25\n    B) ~2.23\n    C) ~2.35\n    D) ~2.32\n\n    The value `2.229` is closest to `2.23`. The small difference is due to the Doppler effect correction. Without the Doppler correction (`T1 = T2`), the ratio would have been exactly `1.5^2 = 2.25`. The Doppler effect slightly reduces the final ratio. The mass information was indeed irrelevant.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2 (`L1 / L2`).\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = A * σ * T⁴\n    where A is the surface area (4πR²), R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n    So, L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁²/R₂²) * (T₁⁴/T₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂) ² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *Note: The information about the mass is not needed for this calculation, as the black body luminosity formula depends on radius and temperature, not mass.*\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\n    *   **Wien's Law:** The temperature of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_emitted_max`) by Wien's Displacement Law: T = b / `λ_emitted_max`, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio from Wavelength:** This implies that the ratio of temperatures is inversely proportional to the ratio of their *emitted* peak wavelengths:\n        T₁/T₂ = `λ_emitted_max,2` / `λ_emitted_max,1`\n\n6.  **Account for the Doppler Effect:**\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs,1` = `λ_obs,2`). However, the temperature depends on the wavelength *emitted* by the star. The motion of the star relative to the observer causes a Doppler shift between the emitted and observed wavelengths.\n    *   **Star_1:** Has a radial velocity of 0. There is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength: `λ_obs,1` = `λ_emitted,1`.\n    *   **Star_2:** Has a radial velocity (v) of 700 km/s. This velocity is significant enough to require the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Assuming the star is moving away from us (recession, a standard convention for positive radial velocity), its light is redshifted:\n        `λ_obs,2` = `λ_emitted,2` * √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)), where c is the speed of light.\n\n7.  **Combine Wavelength Information:** Since `λ_obs,1` = `λ_obs,2`, we can write:\n    `λ_emitted,1` = `λ_emitted,2` * √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))\n    Now, we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths needed for the temperature ratio:\n    `λ_emitted,2` / `λ_emitted,1` = 1 / √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)) = √((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))\n\n8.  **Finalize the Temperature Ratio:** Substituting this back into the temperature ratio expression from step 5:\n    T₁/T₂ = √((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))\n    Therefore, the fourth power of the temperature ratio is:\n    (T₁/T₂)⁴ = [√((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))]⁴ = ((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))²\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now, substitute this expression back into the equation from step 4:\n    L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c))²\n    To get the final numerical answer, we plug in the values `v = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s` and `c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s`. The provided python script has already performed this calculation.\n\nThe script's calculation is:\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - 700000/299792458) / (1 + 700000/299792458))² ≈ 2.22908\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
