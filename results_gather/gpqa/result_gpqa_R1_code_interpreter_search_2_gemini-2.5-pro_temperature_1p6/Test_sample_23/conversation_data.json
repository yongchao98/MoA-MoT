    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H)`. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we have:\n        `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n        So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   The general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This implies that all components of both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which rearranges into Z upon hydrogenation. Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is cyclohexane (`C6H12`).\n    *   Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n        Mass fraction H = `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n    *   This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**. All compounds in mixtures X and Y must therefore be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed by the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction of cyclic hydrocarbons over a platinum catalyst typically involves hydrogen transfer to form a more saturated compound (cycloalkane) and a more unsaturated, stable compound (aromatic ring).\n    *   So, the products are likely cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if Y = {benzene, cyclohexane} fits the description:\n        *   Equimolar mixture: This is possible if the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1.\n        *   Two liquids: Benzene and cyclohexane are liquids at room temperature.\n        *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Correct. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y: Correct, cyclohexane is in the mixture.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X.**\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, so X1 and X2 are C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. This suggests a 1:1 reaction between the components of X:\n        `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    *   We can determine the formulas of X1 and X2 by balancing the atoms. The total number of carbon atoms on both sides is 12. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        `H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(C6H6) + H_atoms(C6H12)`\n        `H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 6 + 12 = 18`\n    *   We are looking for two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. Let's consider the possibilities:\n        *   Cyclohexene: `C6H10`. This has one C=C bond and is not conjugated.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene: `C6H8`. This has two non-conjugated C=C bonds.\n        *   (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene, `C6H8`, is conjugated, so it is explicitly excluded).\n    *   Let's try the combination of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene:\n        *   Number of hydrogen atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   So, the reaction is:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized to benzene (loses 2H) and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane (gains 2H). All conditions are met.\n    *   Thus, **mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n    *   H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
