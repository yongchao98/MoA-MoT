    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` represents a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The bridgehead carbons where the fusion occurs are C1 and C6. The oxygen atom is denoted as O7.\n    *   There are methyl substituents at carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given by the R/S descriptors: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S.\n\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. In this reaction, it acts as a source of a methyl nucleophile (effectively \"CH₃⁻\").\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The problem describes the reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate. This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of the epoxide. Two key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methyl group) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n**2. Identify the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We need to determine which one is less sterically hindered.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center within the epoxide system.\n*   Carbon C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom (implied, as its valency is not filled by a named substituent), making it a secondary carbon center.\n*   A tertiary carbon is more sterically hindered than a secondary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\n*   **At C6 (Site of Attack):** The problem states that C6 has an **S** configuration in the reactant. According to the rule of inversion, its configuration will become **R** in the product.\n*   **At C1 (Other Epoxide Carbon):** The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds to the chiral center C1 itself are broken or formed. The nucleophile does not attack this carbon. Therefore, the configuration at C1 is **retained**. It was **R** in the reactant and will remain **R** in the product. After the ring opens and is protonated (in a workup step), the epoxide oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to C1.\n*   **At C3 and C4:** These chiral centers are not part of the epoxide ring and are not involved in the reaction. Their configurations will be **retained**. C3 remains **R** and C4 remains **R**.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n*   The reaction opens the bicyclic system to form a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   Let's track the substituents from the reactant to the product ring:\n    *   **Reactant C1** becomes a carbon with an -OH group and a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Reactant C6** is attacked by a methyl group, so it becomes a carbon with a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Reactant C3** still has its -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Reactant C4** still has its -CH₃ group.\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol. To name it correctly using IUPAC rules, we must number the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group, so the carbon it is attached to is designated **C1** of the product. This corresponds to C1 of the reactant.\n    *   We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Let's trace the ring from the new C1 in both directions:\n        *   **Path A (counter-clockwise):** The carbons are numbered C1(from reactant C1) -> C2(from R-C6) -> C3(from R-C5) -> C4(from R-C4) -> C5(from R-C3) -> C6(from R-C2). The methyl groups are on product carbons 1, 2, 4, and 5. This gives the locant set **{1, 2, 4, 5}**.\n        *   **Path B (clockwise):** The carbons are numbered C1(from reactant C1) -> C2(from R-C2) -> C3(from R-C3) -> C4(from R-C4) -> C5(from R-C5) -> C6(from R-C6). The methyl groups are on product carbons 1, 3, 4, and 6. This gives the locant set **{1, 3, 4, 6}**.\n    *   Comparing the sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the first point of difference is 2 vs 3. The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Thus, this is the correct numbering scheme.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name**\n\n*   **Base Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We now map the configurations we determined onto the new numbering system.\n    *   **Product C1:** Corresponds to reactant C1. Configuration is retained as **R**. -> **(1R)**\n    *   **Product C2:** Corresponds to reactant C6. Configuration is inverted from S to **R**. -> **(2R)**\n    *   **Product C4:** Corresponds to reactant C4. Configuration is retained as **R**. -> **(4R)**\n    *   **Product C5:** Corresponds to reactant C3. Configuration is retained as **R**. -> **(5R)**\n*   The full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  (Incorrect C2 configuration)\nB) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol      (Incorrect structure and stereochemistry)\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol       (Incorrect structure)\nD) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  (Matches our result)\n\nThe correct product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
