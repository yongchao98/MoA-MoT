    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on a benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   **Reagents:** Nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generate the electrophile, the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺).\n*   **Product 1:** The electrophile (NO₂⁺) will add to the positions ortho or para to the methyl group. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is the major product. Therefore, **Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the oxidation of the methyl group on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is 4-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent that can oxidize a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to this oxidation.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, **Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an acid-base reaction.\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Acetone is the solvent, and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base.\n*   **Product 3:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-nitrobenzoic acid will be deprotonated by the hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from NaOH. This forms a carboxylate salt and water. Therefore, **Product 3 is sodium 4-nitrobenzoate**, which consists of the sodium cation (Na⁺) and the 4-nitrobenzoate anion.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3 (the 4-nitrobenzoate anion).**\n\nTo find the point group, we analyze the symmetry elements of the 4-nitrobenzoate anion. The anion consists of a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at opposite (para) positions.\n\n1.  **Principal Axis (Cₙ):** There is a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the centers of the C1-C4 bond of the benzene ring and bisects the O-C-O angle of the carboxylate group and the O-N-O angle of the nitro group. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged. So, n=2.\n\n2.  **Perpendicular C₂ Axes:** There are two additional C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal C₂ axis.\n    *   One C₂ axis lies in the plane of the molecule, passing through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   Another C₂ axis is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passes through the center of the benzene ring.\n    Since there are n=2 C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal C₂ axis, the molecule belongs to a **D** group. Specifically, a **D₂** group.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σₕ):** A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is a plane perpendicular to the principal axis. The plane of the benzene ring itself is a mirror plane. Since this plane is perpendicular to the C₂ axis that passes through the center of the ring and is perpendicular to the ring plane, this mirror plane can be considered a σₕ.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** A point group that has a C₂ principal axis, two perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) is the **D₂h** point group.\n\nThe presence of a D₂ axis system and a σₕ plane automatically implies the existence of two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) and a center of inversion (i), which are all present in the 4-nitrobenzoate anion, confirming the D₂h assignment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
