    "An optically active compound is a chiral molecule that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All atoms directly attached to the double bond lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bridged bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The stereodescriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` indicate the specific configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons).\n    *   When a specific stereoisomer is designated with R/S notation and it is not a meso compound, it refers to a single enantiomer. A pure enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. The complex and asymmetric structure makes it highly unlikely to be a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are identical to the substituents on C3. This configuration allows for the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration for 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is the meso form. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond when viewed in an eclipsed conformation, and a center of inversion in its anti-periplanar conformation.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active** (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereoisomers are (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), which are a pair of enantiomers, and (2R,3S), which is the meso form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, indicating a single enantiomer.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH=CH-` (part of the ring), and `-CH2-CH2-` (the other part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name refers to the cis-isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three -OH groups pointing up. The molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the carbon atom directly opposite it in the ring (e.g., the plane containing C1 and C4).\n    *   Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers: There are none. For instance, the carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are attached to two hydrogen atoms, except for the one bonded to the carbonyl group, which is attached to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the symmetric ring.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the carbonyl group, the `alpha-CH2` group, the `beta-CH` group, and bisects both the cyclopentyl ring and the two methyl groups of the isobutyl fragment.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
