    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. We use the term symbol notation `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(initial) = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the total orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the initial NN system is given by `P(initial NN) = (-1)^L(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe total parity of the initial state is just that of the NN system: `P(initial) = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\nThe final state consists of the NN system (`NN(final)`) and particle X.\n\nWe need to check three conservation laws and two given conditions:\n1.  **Fundamental State Existence:** The quantum numbers for the NN state must be possible for a system of two spin-1/2 particles (nucleons). This means the total spin `S(NN)` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet).\n2.  **Pauli Principle for Final NN State:** The problem states that for the final NN state, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also specifies that `T(NN) = 0`.\n    Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes `0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which simplifies to `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an **odd** number.\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^L(NN)`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given for particle X).\n    *   `P(orbital) = (-1)^L(X)` where `L(X)` is the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN system.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1) = (-1)^(L(NN) + L(X))`.\n    *   This means `L(NN) + L(X)` must be an **odd** number.\n4.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum vector must be conserved: `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J(final))`.\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `vec(J(final)) = vec(J(NN)) + vec(j(X))`, where `j(X)` is the total angular momentum of particle X. Assuming X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion), `j(X) = L(X)`.\n    *   The conservation equation becomes `0 = vec(J(NN)) + vec(L(X))`.\n    *   This vector equation can only be satisfied if the magnitudes are equal: `J(NN) = L(X)`.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe will now check each option against the four conditions derived above. The spectroscopic notation for X is: `s` (L=0), `p` (L=1), `d` (L=2), `f` (L=3).\n\n| Option | Final NN | Final X | `S(NN)` | `L(NN)` | `J(NN)` | `L(X)` | **1. S valid?** (`0` or `1`) | **2. Pauli?** (`S+L` odd?) | **3. Parity?** (`L+L(X)` odd?) | **4. Ang. Mom.?** (`J=L(X)`?) | **Permitted?** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A | `3D3` | `f` | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **Yes** (S=1) | **Yes** (1+2=3) | **Yes** (2+3=5) | **Yes** (3=3) | **Yes** |\n| B | `3S1` | `p` | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | **Yes** (S=1) | **Yes** (1+0=1) | **Yes** (0+1=1) | **Yes** (1=1) | **Yes** |\n| C | `3P0` | `s` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | **Yes** (S=1) | **No** (1+1=2) | **Yes** (1+0=1) | **Yes** (0=0) | **No** |\n| D | `7D1` | `p` | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | **No** (S=3) | **Yes** (3+2=5) | **Yes** (2+1=3) | **Yes** (1=1) | **No** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe find that two options describe forbidden transitions:\n\n*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition given in the problem. For the final state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) with `T=0`, `S+L = 1+1=2` (even), which contradicts the requirement that `S+L` must be odd for `T=0`.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is not permitted because the final NN state `7D1` implies a total spin `S=3`. A system of two spin-1/2 nucleons can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. Therefore, the state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nThe question asks for the *one* partial wave that is not permitted. Option C is forbidden because it fails a specific rule that the problem instructs the solver to use. Option D is forbidden for a more fundamental reason (the state's non-existence) which is not explicitly listed as a check. In the context of applying the given rules, Option C is the most direct answer as it fails one of the explicit checks (the Pauli rule).\n\n<<<C>>>"
