The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Goal:** To study the developmental fate of a new ligand-receptor pair from the neural crest.\n    *   **Tool:** A bicistronic lox-Cre-dependent reporter mouse.\n    *   **The DNA Construct:**\n        *   A single mRNA is transcribed under the CBA promoter (a strong, ubiquitously active promoter).\n        *   The mRNA structure is: `[Ligand ORF] - [loxP-stop-loxP] - [mCherry] - [IRES] - [Receptor ORF] - [lox2272-stop-lox2272] - [eGFP]`.\n    *   **How it's supposed to work (in the presence of Cre recombinase):**\n        *   Cre recombinase recognizes `loxP` sites and cuts out the intervening \"stop\" sequence. This joins the Ligand ORF in-frame with the mCherry ORF, producing a red fluorescent fusion protein (Ligand-mCherry).\n        *   Cre recombinase also recognizes `lox2272` sites (a different type of lox site) and cuts out the intervening \"stop\" sequence.\n        *   The IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) allows ribosomes to start translating independently at the Receptor ORF.\n        *   After the `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette is removed, the Receptor ORF should be joined in-frame with the eGFP ORF, producing a green fluorescent fusion protein (Receptor-eGFP).\n    *   **The In-Vitro Test:** The construct was transfected into astrocytes (which do not express Cre recombinase). A Western blot using antibodies against the ligand and receptor proteins showed a signal. This is expected. Without Cre, the \"stop\" cassettes are present. The ribosome translates the Ligand ORF and stops. The IRES allows the ribosome to translate the Receptor ORF and stop. So, the untagged ligand and receptor proteins are made, which the antibodies would detect. This test confirms the basic ORFs and promoters are functional, but it *does not* test the fusion tags (mCherry and eGFP).\n    *   **The In-Vivo Experiment:**\n        *   A mouse homozygous for this construct is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n        *   SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells, which is the cell population of interest.\n        *   Therefore, in the offspring, any cell that expressed SOX10 at any point will now also express Cre recombinase.\n        *   In these SOX10-lineage cells, Cre should excise both stop cassettes, leading to the expression of Ligand-mCherry (red signal) and Receptor-eGFP (green signal).\n    *   **The Result:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\" The experiment failed for the green channel.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Potential Reasons (The Options):**\n\n    *   **A) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** If the fusion protein was being made but improperly folded or trafficked, it would likely accumulate in a cellular compartment like the Endoplasmic Reticulum or Golgi. However, eGFP would still be synthesized and would fluoresce. You would see a green signal, even if it's in the wrong place (e.g., as bright spots near the nucleus instead of at the cell membrane). The problem states there is *no* green signal, suggesting the fluorescent protein isn't being made at all. This makes option A unlikely.\n\n    *   **B) Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship describes how the cells communicate (one cell secretes the ligand, a neighboring cell receives the signal). This is a biological characteristic the experiment aims to study. It has no bearing on whether the reporter proteins (mCherry, eGFP) are successfully synthesized within the cells where the construct is active. This option is irrelevant to the technical failure of the reporter.\n\n    *   **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** An enhancer is a DNA sequence that boosts transcription. However, the construct uses the **CBA promoter**, which is a very strong, constitutive promoter designed to drive high levels of expression in almost all cell types, independent of the cell's native enhancers for that gene. The expression of the construct is driven by the CBA promoter, not the endogenous promoters/enhancers of the ligand and receptor genes. Therefore, a missing endogenous enhancer is not the problem.\n\n    *   **D) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a very common technical pitfall in designing this type of reporter construct. When Cre recombinase removes the `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette, a single `lox2272` site (34 bp long) is left behind. For the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein to be made correctly, the reading frame must be maintained. This means the number of base pairs from the end of the Receptor ORF, through the remaining `lox2272` site, to the start of the eGFP ORF must be a multiple of three. If it is not, a frameshift mutation occurs. The ribosome will read the Receptor part correctly, but then it will read the eGFP part in the wrong frame. This will almost immediately lead to a premature stop codon or result in a nonsensical, non-fluorescent peptide. This scenario perfectly explains a complete lack of a green signal, even though the DNA recombination event happened as planned. The preliminary Western blot test wouldn't have detected this problem because it was done without Cre and only detected the non-fused receptor protein.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The most plausible technical explanation for the complete absence of a green signal, given that the rest of the system is expected to work, is a frameshift mutation between the receptor and the eGFP ORFs that is only revealed after Cre-mediated recombination.\n\n<<<D>>>"
