    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (like a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). Its frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated to an aromatic ring (e.g., Ar-COOR). It is too high for a conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** The broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group, which is consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The presence of two distinct signals for the aromatic protons means the two substituents are different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG), and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The signal at 8.0 ppm is significantly deshielded (downfield), indicating these protons are ortho to a strong EWG (like the -COOCH2CH3 group). The signal at 7.0 ppm is more shielded (upfield), indicating these protons are ortho to an EDG (like the -NH2 group).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\n    This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amine (-NH-), not primary. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ester, ethyl group on the ester, and a para-disubstituted ring with EDG/EWG. This is the correct structure.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Also, the C=O is an amide (~1650 cm-1), not an ester (1720 cm-1). Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the connectivity is different. It's a phenyl ester, and the carbonyl group is part of a propionyl group (-C(=O)CH2CH3). The NMR for the ethyl part would show a quartet around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that fits all the spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
