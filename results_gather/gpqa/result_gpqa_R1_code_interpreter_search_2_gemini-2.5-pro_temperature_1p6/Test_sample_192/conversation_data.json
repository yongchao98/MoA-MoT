    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In astrophysics and physics problems, this phrasing typically refers to the number density or distribution function. So, the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = k * (1/plx^5)`\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. This corresponds to the quantity `dN/dr`. We need to find the proportionality between `dN/dr` and the distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related. Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance when the distance is measured in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds. The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    To find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    Using the relationship `plx = 1/r`, we differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr = [k * (1/plx^5)] * [-1/r²]`\n\n    To get the final relationship in terms of `r`, we must replace `plx` with its equivalent in `r` (`plx = 1/r`):\n    `dN/dr = [k * (1 / (1/r)⁵)] * [-1/r²]`\n    `dN/dr = [k * r⁵] * [-1/r²]`\n    `dN/dr = -k * r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr = -k * r³`\n\n7.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr = -k * r³` shows that `dN/dr` is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign arises because distance `r` and parallax `plx` are inversely related (as one increases, the other decreases). When discussing the number of stars per unit distance (a density), we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. Therefore, the number density of stars with respect to distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
