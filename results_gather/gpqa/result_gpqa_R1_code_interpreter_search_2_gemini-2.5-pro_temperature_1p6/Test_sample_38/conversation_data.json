    "The problem requires finding the value of the normalization constant \"a\" for a given wave function ψ(x).\n\n**1. The Normalization Principle**\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. This means that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1. The probability density is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². The normalization condition is expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found.\n\n**2. Defining the Space (Limits of Integration)**\nThe problem states that particles were only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, these are the limits of our integration. The normalization equation becomes:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**3. Calculating the Modulus Squared |ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function is given as a complex number:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nA complex number z = R + iI has a modulus squared |z|² = R² + I².\nFor our wave function:\n*   Real part, R(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part, I(x) = -0.5\n\nSo, the modulus squared is:\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4. Setting up and Solving the Integral**\nNow we substitute this into our normalization equation:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) [ a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫ (from 1 to 3) 0.25 dx = 1\n\nLet's solve each part:\n*   The first integral: ∫ [a² / (1 + x)] dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n*   The second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x ] (from 1 to 3) = 1\n\nSubstitute the limits:\n(a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\n\n**5. Solving for \"a\"**\nGroup the terms:\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25) = 1\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n**6.
