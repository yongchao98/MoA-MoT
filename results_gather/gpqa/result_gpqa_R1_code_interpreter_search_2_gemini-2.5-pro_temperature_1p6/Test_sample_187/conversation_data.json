    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Parameters:** The problem states we have a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are:\n    *   Lattice parameter (interatomic distance), `a = 10` Angstrom.\n    *   Interaxial angles, `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The plane of interest is (hkl) = (111).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Interplanar Distance:** For a rhombohedral crystal system, the formula for the interplanar distance `d` for a plane (hkl) is given by:\n\n    1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the necessary components:**\n    *   For the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.\n    *   h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n    *   hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n    *   a = 10, so a² = 100\n    *   α = 30°\n        *   sin(30°) = 0.5\n        *   cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:** The formula involves several trigonometric and algebraic terms, which are best computed using a calculator or a script to ensure accuracy.\n\n    Let's set up the calculation to be performed by a Python script.\n    *   `a = 10`\n    *   `alpha_deg = 30`\n    *   `h, k, l = 1, 1, 1`\n\n    The script will calculate:\n    *   `alpha_rad = math.radians(30)`\n    *   `cos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)`\n    *   `sin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)`\n    *   **Numerator:** `(3 * sin_alpha**2) + (2 * 3 * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha))`\n    *   **Denominator:** `(100 * (1 - 3*cos_alpha**2 + 2*cos_alpha**3))`\n    *   `inv_d_squared = Numerator / Denominator`\n    *   `d = 1 / math.sqrt(inv_d_squared)`\n\n5.  **Execute the calculation:** The following Python code performs the computation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30.0\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Convert angle to radians for math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\ncos2_alpha = cos_alpha**2\ncos3_alpha = cos_alpha**3\n\n# Numerator of the 1/d^2 formula\nnumerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * (sin_alpha**2) + 2 * (h*k + k*l + l*h) * (cos2_alpha - cos_alpha)\n\n# Denominator of the 1/d^2 formula\ndenominator = (a**2) * (1 - 3*cos2_alpha + 2*cos3_alpha)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\n# The denominator can be very small, so it's good practice to check it's not zero.\nif denominator == 0:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero. The parameters result in an invalid crystallographic state.\")\nelse:\n    inv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n    d = 1 / math.sqrt(inv_d_squared)\n    print(d)\n```\n<execute_result>\n9.54269553556855\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   C) 9.54 Angstrom\n    *   D) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An analysis of the user's code output indicates no errors were generated, and a numerical result was produced.\n\n**Code Output Analysis:**\n*   The code calculated the interplanar distance `d` for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n*   The input parameters were: a = 10 Å, α = β = γ = 30°, and (h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1).\n*   The calculated output is `d ≈ 9.543` Angstrom.\n\n**Comparison with Provided Options:**\nThe calculated value of 9.543 Å is compared with the given multiple-choice options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 9.08 Angstrom\nC) 9.54 Angstrom\nD) 10.05 Angstrom\n\nThe result from the code, `9.543 Å`, most closely matches option C, `9.54 Angstrom`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
