    "*   **Analysis of the Observations:**\n    1.  **<sup>1</sup>H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton). They have similar chemical shifts but are resolved. Their integrals are roughly equal and sum up to the expected value for one proton (1H). This indicates the presence of two different species in a roughly 1:1 ratio, where the alpha-proton in each species is in a slightly different chemical environment. The problem statement explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause.\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the crude compound into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms there are two different compounds or isomers that have different interactions with the stationary phase of the LC column, allowing them to be separated. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they have different 3D arrangements, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton, to have different chemical shifts. Two peaks for one proton type are expected.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can typically be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This would result in two separate peaks in the LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. This option fits all the observations perfectly. A common source of diastereomers in peptide synthesis is either epimerization at an alpha-carbon or the formation of *cis/trans* isomers around an amide bond (these are a form of diastereomer known as atropisomers if the rotation is hindered).\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight from the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product, ruling out this option.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. You would see only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** On a standard, achiral LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and co-elute, producing a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, this option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was incorporated into the peptide chain. This would create a new molecule with a significantly higher mass. The MS data, which shows the mass of the expected molecule, rules this out.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but have different physical properties (separable by LC) and different NMR spectra is the defining characteristic of a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
