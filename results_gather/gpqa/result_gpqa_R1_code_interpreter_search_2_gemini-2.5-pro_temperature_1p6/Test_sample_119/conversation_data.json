    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement of a star's apparent shift in position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        Therefore, the distance to a star can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** This assumption means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density ρ (rho).\n\n2.  **Consider the Number of Stars in a Volume of Space:**\n    *   Let's calculate the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from Earth, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area of Sphere) * (thickness)`\n        `dV = (4 * π * d²) * dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the number density (ρ) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax (plx):**\n    *   Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now, let's find the relationship between the differential `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   When considering the number of stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related).\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * |dd|`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms with `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the last equation:\n        `dN / d(plx) = (ρ * 4 * π) / plx⁴`\n    *   Since ρ, 4, and π are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
