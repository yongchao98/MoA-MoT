    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    In relativistic mechanics, for a particle moving in a one-dimensional potential U(x), the total energy E is conserved. The total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy, but it's more convenient to express it in terms of the total relativistic energy γmc² and the potential energy U(x). The conservation law is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\text{constant}$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy at position $x$.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy of a Harmonic Oscillator:**\n    The force is given by Hooke's law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ corresponding to this force is:\n    $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy to the Oscillator's Motion:**\n    We will evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the motion where we know the values of position and velocity.\n\n    *   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        At the maximum displacement, the particle momentarily comes to rest.\n        *   Position: $x = A$\n        *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n        *   Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the particle's speed is at its maximum.\n        *   Position: $x = 0$\n        *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy at this point is:\n            $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we isolate $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides of the equation:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The derived expression for the maximum speed $v_{max}$ is identical to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
