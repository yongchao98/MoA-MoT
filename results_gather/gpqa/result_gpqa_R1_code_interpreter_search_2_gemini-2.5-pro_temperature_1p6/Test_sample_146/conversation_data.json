    "*   **1. Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n*   **2. Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume it is at rest.\n    *   Typically, in such problems, the proton is also considered to be at rest in the lab frame (e.g., a stationary target).\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. Let's find this value.\n    <search>proton rest mass energy in MeV</search>\n<information>The accepted value for the proton's rest mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c². Therefore, its rest mass energy (mc²) is approximately 938.272 MeV.</information>\n    *   So, $m_{p}c^2 = m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **3. Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_{A}c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy in the final state ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is its velocity.\n    *   To conserve momentum (initial momentum is zero), the final particles must fly off in different directions such that the total vector momentum is zero. By symmetry, all four final particles will have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same energy, $E_A$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n*   **4. Applying Energy Conservation:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n    *   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$.\n    *   $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Plugging in the values:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n*   **5. Calculating the Velocity:**\n    *   Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v_A$.\n    *   $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v_A/c)^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1-(v_A/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v_A/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n    *   $(v_A/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n    *   $v_A/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Let's compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma = 938.3 / 600\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\nprint(f\"{beta=}\")\n```\n<execution_result>\nbeta=0.769493188899805\n</execution_result>\n*   **6. Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that $v_A/c \\approx 0.7695$.\n    This means the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 0.77c\n    B) 0.96c\n    C) 0.91c\n    D) 0.86c\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    *   The system initially consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. We assume the proton is also at rest (as is typical for a target in such problems).\n    *   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is the same as that of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since these are particle-antiparticle pairs, they all have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   After the annihilation, these four particles will move away with some velocity, $v_A$.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of these four particles.\n    *   The relativistic energy of one particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor associated with the velocity $v_A$.\n    *   To conserve momentum (the initial momentum is zero), the four particles must move in such a way that their total vector momentum is zero.
