    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reagents**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is `2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid`. Let's first determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   The base structure is a six-membered ring (`cyclohex`).\n    *   It has a double bond between carbon 3 and 4 (`-3-en`).\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (`-carboxylic acid`), which by IUPAC convention is at position 1.\n    *   It has a formyl group (`-CHO`) at position 2.\n    *   It has a vinyl group (`-CH=CH2`) at position 5.\n\n*   **Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    Let's count the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxylic acid (-COOH) + 1 in the formyl group (-CHO) + 2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count them on the structure.\n        *   Ring Hydrogens: H on C1(1), C2(1), C3(1), C4(1), C5(1), C6(2) = 7 H.\n        *   Group Hydrogens: H in -COOH(1), H in -CHO(1), H in -CH=CH2(3) = 5 H.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12 H.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the carboxylic acid (-COOH) + 1 in the formyl group (-CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n\n**2. Determine the Chemical Reaction and the Product**\n\n*   The reaction with Red P and excess HI is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   Here's how each part of the reactant molecule will be transformed:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** Reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO):** Reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Alkene double bond in the ring (-C=C-):** Reduced to a single bond (-CH-CH-).\n    *   **Alkene double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2):** Reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The cyclohexane ring itself is stable and will not be opened under these conditions.\n\n*   **Structure of the Product:**\n    Based on the transformations above, the product will be:\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `-COOH` at C1 becomes a `-CH3` group.\n    *   The `-CHO` at C2 becomes a `-CH3` group.\n    *   The `-CH=CH2` at C5 becomes a `-CH2CH3` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    Let's determine the formula for `1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane`.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the methyl group at C1 + 1 in the methyl group at C2 + 2 in the ethyl group at C5 = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** A saturated monocyclic alkane (cycloalkane) has the general formula CnH2n. For n=10, the formula is C10H20. We can also count them manually:\n        *   Ring H: H on C1(1), C2(1), C3(2), C4(2), C5(1), C6(2) = 9 H.\n        *   Substituent H: H in one -CH3(3), H in the other -CH3(3), H in -CH2CH3(5) = 11 H.\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 9 + 11 = 20 H.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\n*   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n*   The formula for IHD for a molecule with the formula CxHyOz is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    (Note: Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.)\n\n*   Let's apply this formula to our product, C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe IHD of the product is 1. This value corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton, as the product molecule is otherwise fully saturated (it has no double or triple bonds).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated IHD of 1 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
