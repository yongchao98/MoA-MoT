    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position C2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) dissolved in condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the active species being the amide ion, NH₂⁻), and this set of reagents is characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, specifically involving a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n    *   The benzyne mechanism begins with the abstraction of a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The strong base, NH₂⁻, can abstract a proton from either position. However, a C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than a C-D bond. This difference in reaction rates is known as the **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**.\n    *   Because of the KIE, abstracting the proton from C6 is faster than abstracting the deuteron from C2. This leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6.**\n        1.  NH₂⁻ removes the H⁺ from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2.**\n        1.  Although slower, it is still possible for NH₂⁻ to remove the D⁺ from C2.\n        2.  This leads to the elimination of Br⁻ from C1.\n        3.  This forms a different benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne (C₆H₄)**.\n\n         \n\n    Since both pathways are possible (even if one is much faster), we must consider the products from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), then attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond in the benzyne intermediate. This is followed by protonation of the resulting aryl anion by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the D is at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the -D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the -D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n        *   Thus, the major pathway leads to two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        *   This intermediate is the standard, symmetrical benzyne.\n        *   NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2 of the triple bond (which are equivalent), and the other carbon is protonated by NH₃.\n        *   The resulting product contains no deuterium. It is simply **aniline (C₆H₅NH₂) **.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    *   By considering all possible (major and minor) pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n        1.  2-Deuterioaniline\n        2.  3-Deuterioaniline\n        3.  Aniline\n\n    Therefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
