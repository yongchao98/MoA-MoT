    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For an electron in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number, *n*) and its spin state (spin quantum number, *m_s*). Since the spin can be either up (+1/2) or down (-1/2), each energy level *n* can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n\n3.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** For a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n    The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the energy of a particle in the *n*-th level is $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$):**\n    To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The lowest energy level is n=1. It can hold two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n    *   The next lowest energy level is n=2. It can hold the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        $E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting a single particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   We promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   **Excitation A (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total Energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n    *   **Excitation B:** Promote one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest available level, n=3.\n        *   Configuration: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Excitation C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to the next available level, n=4.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Excitation D (two particles):** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), we can order them:\n    *   Ground State: 10E\n    *   First Excited State: 15E\n    *   Second Excited State: 18E\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# The energy of a particle in level n is n^2 * E. Let E=1 for calculation.\ndef energy_level(n):\n    return n**2\n\n# Ground State (GS)\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\nE_gs = 2 * energy_level(1) + 2 * energy_level(2)\n\n# First Excited State (1st)\n# Configuration: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3\nE_1st = 2 * energy_level(1) + 1 * energy_level(2) + 1 * energy_level(3)\n\n# Second Excited State (2nd)\n# We need to find the next lowest energy state.\n# Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3\n# Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nE_2nd_A = 1 * energy_level(1) + 2 * energy_level(2) + 1 * energy_level(3)\n\n# Possibility B: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3\nE_2nd_B = 2 * energy_level(1) + 2 * energy_level(3)\n\n# Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4\n# Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4\nE_2nd_C = 2 * energy_level(1) + 1 * energy_level(2) + 1 * energy_level(4)\n\n# The second excited state is the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n# We compare the energies from possibilities A, B, and C.\nE_2nd = min(E_2nd_A, E_2nd_B, E_2nd_C)\n\nprint(f\"The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:\")\nprint(f\"{E_gs}E, {E_1st}E, {E_2nd}E\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
