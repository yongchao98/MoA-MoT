    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations required to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water.\n*   The initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) are:\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.\n*   The new total volume after adding water is:\n    Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n*   The concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    New Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   Titrating a weak acid (CH₃COOH) with a strong base (NaOH) creates a buffer solution in the region before the equivalence point. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where HA is acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and A⁻ is its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate (A⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid (HA) remains unreacted.\n*   Therefore, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n    Moles of Acid = Moles of Base\n    0.001 moles = (0.1 mol/L) × Volume of NaOH\n    Volume of NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) in the solution:\n    [A⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   We can set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Let x = [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   Solving for x gives us the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].\n*   From [OH⁻], we calculate the pOH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n*   Finally, we find the pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nTo perform these calculations precisely, we can use the following Python code:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25/75 = 1/3\nratio_25 = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(ratio_25)\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\n\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n\n# Initial moles of acetic acid\ninitial_acid_moles = 0.05 * 0.020 # M * L\n\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence point\neq_vol_naoh = initial_acid_moles / 0.1 # moles / M\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\n# Initial diluted acid volume (40mL) + NaOH volume (10mL)\ntotal_vol_eq = 0.040 + eq_vol_naoh\n\n# Concentration of acetate (A-) at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus_eq = initial_acid_moles / total_vol_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = x^2 / [A-]\n# x = [OH-]\nx = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(x)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The step-by-step reasoning and Python code provided have successfully calculated the pH at both specified points in the titration.\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration**: The calculation using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])) correctly determined the pH to be 4.26. At this point, the ratio of conjugate base (acetate) to acid (acetic acid) is 25:75 or 1:3.\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: The calculation first determined the concentration of the acetate ion formed at the equivalence point. Then, by treating the acetate as a weak base hydrolyzing in water, it calculated the resulting [OH⁻] concentration, the pOH, and finally the pH, which was found to be 8.52.\n\nThe code output confirms these results:\n*   pH at 25% titration: 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThese calculated values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
