    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR*: The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to determine what chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Using the atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1, O≈16):\n        *   The fragment `[COOH]+` has a mass of 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 1.01 ≈ 45.\n        *   The fragment `[CH3CH2O]+` (ethoxy) also has a mass of (2 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + 16.00 ≈ 45.\n    *   Given the overwhelming evidence for a carboxylic acid from the FTIR data, the fragment at m/z = 45 is almost certainly the carboxyl group, `[COOH]+`, a very common and characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   All evidence points to a molecule that is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   Let's check which of the proposed chemical formulas matches this description. A key tool is the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**, which tells us the number of rings and pi-bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU for a compound with C, H, and O is: `DoU = C - H/2 + 1`.\n    *   Our identified functional groups are a C=C bond (1 DoU) and a C=O bond from the carboxylic acid (1 DoU). Therefore, the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n    *   Additionally, a carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for each option and check the oxygen count:\n    *   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1. Only one oxygen. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **B) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2. Correct DoU, but only one oxygen. A carboxylic acid has two. **Incorrect.**\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2. This has the correct DoU (for a C=C and a C=O) and the correct number of oxygens (two) for a carboxylic acid. **This is a perfect match.** An example of such a compound is 4-hexenoic acid.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1. Two oxygens are present, but the DoU is too low to accommodate both an alkene and a carboxylic acid. **Incorrect.**\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that accommodates all the spectroscopic evidence—a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and a fragment of m/z=45—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
