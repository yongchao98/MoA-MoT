    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the spectral data provided:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectra for each individual compound listed in the options.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent aromatic proton. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (one signal, 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Summary: 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C1-C2 and C4-C3 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but coupling between chemically equivalent protons is not observed, so they appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry (one signal, 6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (second signal, 6H).\n        *   This results in **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (ratio 1:1).*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The formula is C10H14. This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one **singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. This gives one **quartet** (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and one **triplet** (for the 6H of the CH3 groups).\n    *   The presence of a quartet and a triplet immediately disqualifies any option containing this compound, as the problem states only singlets are observed in the alkyl region.\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, these two singlets will likely have different chemical shifts. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal represents 2H, we get **two singlets with a 1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, we have three signals. The integral ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   This option is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet. The problem specifies only singlets in the alkyl region. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only combination of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
