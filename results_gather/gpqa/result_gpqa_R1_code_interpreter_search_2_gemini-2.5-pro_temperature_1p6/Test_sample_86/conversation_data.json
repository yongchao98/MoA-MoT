    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached to it. The base formula for the ring part is C6H4.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's represent this substituent as -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X (0 carbons).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -COCH3.\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n\n3.  **Count the Protons:**\n    *   The benzene ring part (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) has 3 methyl protons.\n    *   The total number of protons is 4 + 3 = 7 hydrogens. All the given options (A, B, C, D) have a total integration of 7 protons, so we must rely on chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their integration will be **3H**. The electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group will deshield them, so their chemical shift (δ) should be in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-):** There are 4 aromatic protons. Their splitting pattern depends on the relative positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n        *   **ortho (1,2-disubstitution):** This would result in a complex pattern with four distinct signals for the 4 inequivalent protons.\n        *   **meta (1,3-disubstitution):** This would also result in a complex pattern, typically with four distinct signals.\n        *   **para (1,4-disubstitution):** This is a highly symmetrical arrangement. There are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. This results in a very characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically δ = 7.0-8.0 ppm, deshielded by the electron-withdrawing groups.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   It has a 3H singlet, but the chemical shift of 1.3 ppm is too low for a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n        *   The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This perfectly matches the predicted signal for the acetyl methyl group (singlet, 3H, δ ≈ 2.0-2.6 ppm).\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   This data is fully consistent with the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, not 3H. This does not match the methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n        *   There is no 3H singlet for the methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone is B. The specific compound is a para-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4'-bromoacetophenone or 4'-chloroacetophenone).\n\n<<<B>>>"
