    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial state:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. Their spins are ignored. The combined system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2=1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l=2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:** A measurement is performed on the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenstates of these operators are the uncoupled states, denoted by $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$, or more simply $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ in this context.\n\n3.  **Identify the target outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_{l1}\\hbar$. So, we want the outcome where $m_{l1}=-1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_{l2}\\hbar$. So, we want the outcome where $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    *   The target state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics:** The probability of measuring the system to be in the target state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, when it is initially in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$, is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the target state. This projection is represented by an inner product:\n    $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1\\rangle|^2$.\n\n5.  **Use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:** The inner product $\\langle m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients relate the coupled basis ($|l,m\\rangle$) to the uncoupled basis ($|m_{l1},m_{l2}\\rangle$). A crucial property (or selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of the angular momentum add up:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n6.  **Check the selection rule:**\n    *   For the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the target measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare $m$ and $m_{l1} + m_{l2}$: Is $-1 = -2$? No, it is not.\n\n7.  **Conclude the result:** Since the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1\\rangle = 0$.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result can also be understood from the principle of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. The target state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with a different eigenvalue: $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar = (-1 - 1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since states with different eigenvalues for the same Hermitian operator are orthogonal, the projection of the initial state onto the target state must be zero.\n\nTo confirm with a calculation:\n```python\nimport sympy.physics.quantum.cg as CG\n\n# We need to find the probability P = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>|^2\n# The parameters are:\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n# The desired measurement outcome is:\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\n\n# The sympy.physics.quantum.cg.CG function calculates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n# The arguments are (j1, m1, j2, m2, j, m).\n# We check if the selection rule m = m1 + m2 holds.\n# m = -1\n# m1 + m2 = -1 + -1 = -2\n# Since -1 is not equal to -2, the coefficient must be 0.\n\ncg_coefficient = CG.CG(l1, m1, l2, m2, l, m).doit()\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n>0\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons. We are given the initial state of the 2-electron system and the desired final measurement outcome.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\nThe system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator $L^2$ and the total z-component of angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Final (Measured) State:**\nA measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of getting the specific outcome where:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the state with quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the state with quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. It is also an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Probability:**\nThe probability of measuring the initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ and finding it in the final state $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of their inner product:\n\n$P = |\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless the z-components of angular momentum are conserved, i.e., $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nLet's check this condition:\n*   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n*   From the final state, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. Their sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle -1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThis can also be understood as the initial state and the final state being eigenvectors of the same operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. The probability of transitioning between orthogonal states is zero.\n\nThe provided Python code confirms this result, calculating the probability to be 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
