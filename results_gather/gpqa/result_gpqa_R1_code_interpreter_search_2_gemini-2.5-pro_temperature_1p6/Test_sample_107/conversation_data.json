    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling of an electron's orbital angular momentum to an external magnetic field is described by the Zeeman effect. The energy shift, which we can denote as $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$, is given by:\n\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B \\cdot m \\cdot B$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, which is the natural unit for expressing the magnetic moment of an electron.\n*   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n*   $B$ is the magnitude of the external magnetic field.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The magnetic field $B = 1$ T.\n*   We should consider \"small values of m\". A representative small, non-zero integer value for the magnetic quantum number is $m=1$.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is a physical constant. It is most convenient to express it in units of electron-volts per Tesla (eV/T) for this problem.\n$\\mu_B = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot (1) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $10^{-5}$ eV.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe problem provides the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of a photon associated with a specific electronic transition in the Hydrogen atom:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the transition from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level in the Hydrogen atom (the blue line in the Balmer series), but we don't need this information to find the energy. The energy ($\\Delta E$) of a photon can be calculated directly from its wavelength using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J路s).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\nA very useful and time-saving constant in these calculations is the product $hc$ expressed in eV路nm:\n$hc \\approx 1240 \\text{ eV路nm}$\n\nFirst, we convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy $\\Delta E$:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV路nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude of the transition energy is approximately $1$ eV.\n\n### **3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values we have calculated:\n\n*   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare them, we can find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, meaning that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$\nThis means that the energy splitting of orbitals due to a 1 Tesla magnetic field is vastly smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic shells in the Hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<D>>>"
