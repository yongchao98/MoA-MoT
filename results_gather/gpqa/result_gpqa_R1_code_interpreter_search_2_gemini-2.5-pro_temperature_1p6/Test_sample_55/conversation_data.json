    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step \"cascade\" decay from the hydrogen atom's |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state. This process occurs via an intermediate state, and each step is an electric dipole transition.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:** For a transition from a state |n,l,m> to |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first transition:** |3,0,0> → intermediate state |n',l',m'>.\n    *   Initial state: |i> = |3,0,0>, so n=3, l=0, m=0.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = l' - 0 = ±1  =>  l' = 1. The intermediate state must be a *p*-state (l=1).\n        *   Δm = m' - 0 = 0, ±1 => m' can be 0, 1, or -1.\n    *   The problem options suggest the intermediate state has n'=2. A transition from n=3 to n'=2 is allowed.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second transition:** Intermediate state |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>.\n    *   Final state: |f> = |1,0,0>, so n''=1, l''=0, m''=0.\n    *   Let's check if the transition from our possible intermediate states is allowed:\n        *   Initial state: |2,1,m'> (with m' = -1, 0, or 1).\n        *   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'. This must be 0 or ±1. This is true for all possible m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n    *   Conclusion: All three potential intermediate states, |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>, can decay to the final state |1,0,0> via a dipole transition. So the routes proposed in options A, B, and C are all valid according to the selection rules.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability of a specific route:**\n    *   The problem asks for the probability of one specific route, for example, |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>. This probability corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step.\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0> (a 3s state). This state is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay is a spontaneous emission process. The atom emits a photon and transitions to a lower energy state. The three possible intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> correspond to the emission of photons with different angular momentum projections.\n    *   Because the initial state |3,0,0> has no angular dependence (it's spherically symmetric), the probability of emitting a photon and transitioning into any of the three degenerate `m'` sub-levels of the `l'=1` state must be equal.\n    *   Let Γ be the transition rate. The rates are calculated from the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element: Γ ∝ |<n',l',m'| **d** |n,l,m>|², where **d** is the dipole operator.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the |3,0,0> state, we have:\n        Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = Γ(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>)\n    *   There are three equally probable decay channels for the first step.\n    *   The total probability of decaying from |3,0,0> to the n=2, l=1 manifold is the sum of the probabilities of the three channels. If we normalize the total probability for this decay to 1, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n    *   Probability (Path via |2,1,m'>) = Γ(to |2,1,m'>) / [Γ(to |2,1,-1>) + Γ(to |2,1,0>) + Γ(to |2,1,1>)] = Γ / (Γ + Γ + Γ) = Γ / (3Γ) = 1/3.\n    *   The second step, the decay from any of the |2,1,m'> states to |1,0,0>, will happen with probability 1, as this is the only dipole-allowed decay channel from the 2p state.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}: The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   D) ...\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}: The probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
