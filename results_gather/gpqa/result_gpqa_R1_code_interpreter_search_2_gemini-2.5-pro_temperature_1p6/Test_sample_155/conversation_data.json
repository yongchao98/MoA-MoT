    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. The structure is symmetric, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr     H\n          \\   /\n           C=C\n          /   \\\n         H     Pr   (where Pr = CH₂CH₂CH₃)\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation. The epoxidation of an alkene is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a *trans*-alkene, this stereospecific reaction produces a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent is achiral, the reaction must produce either an achiral product or a racemic mixture. In this case, attack from the top face and bottom face of the alkene produces two different molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   Attack from one face gives (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the other face gives (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   The result is a racemic mixture (50:50) of these two enantiomers.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, where water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's consider the hydrolysis of each enantiomer from the first step:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-addition, resulting in the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide undergoes anti-addition, also resulting in the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers, but it also has a center of inversion, which makes it an achiral molecule. This type of compound is called a *meso* compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral product: the *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr     Pr\n          \\   /\n           C=C\n          /   \\\n         H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, the resulting cis-4,5-epoxyoctane has a plane of symmetry, making it a *meso* compound ((4R,5S)-epoxyoctane). Even though it has chiral centers, the molecule as a whole is achiral.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The *anti*-addition of two -OH groups to the *meso*-epoxide will produce a racemic mixture of diols.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4) of the protonated meso-epoxide will invert its stereochemistry, leading to one enantiomer of the product, for example, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) is equally likely and will lead to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture (a 1:1 ratio) of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (2) and (3) are **enantiomers**.\n*   (1) is a **diastereomer** of both (2) and (3).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. They will appear as distinct peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol) will produce one peak. The *meso*-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and produce a second, separate peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will also be separated, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
