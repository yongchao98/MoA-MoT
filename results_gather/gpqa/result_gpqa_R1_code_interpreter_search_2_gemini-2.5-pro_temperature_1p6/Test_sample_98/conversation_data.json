    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This multiplicity arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n    Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal has three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (CH), a methylene group (CH₂), and a methyl group (CH₃). The order (dtq) depends on the magnitude of the coupling constants (J), but the combination of neighbors is what matters.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This multiplicity arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to another set of 2 neighboring protons.\n    Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal has three distinct neighboring groups: a single proton (CH) and two different methylene groups (CH₂).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Each Candidate**\n\nThe key is to find a structure that has protons matching both the `dtq` and `dtt` splitting patterns. We will analyze the methine (CH) protons on the main chain, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. The IUPAC numbering for a carboxylic acid starts from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's draw and label the structure:\n```\n      (d) C₂H₅   (f) C₂H₅\n            |         |\n(e)CH₃ -- (c)CH --- (b)CH --- (a)CH₂ --- COOH\n  (5)     (4)       (3)       (2)       (1)\n```\n*   **Analyze H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The two protons of the CH₂(a) group -> **Triplet (t)**\n    *   The single proton H(c) at C4 -> **Doublet (d)**\n    *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in the ethyl substituent (f) -> **Triplet (t)**\n    The predicted splitting for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n\n*   **Analyze H(c) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The three protons of the CH₃(e) group -> **Quartet (q)**\n    *   The single proton H(b) at C3 -> **Doublet (d)**\n    *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in the ethyl substituent (d) -> **Triplet (t)**\n    The predicted splitting for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Structure A exhibits signals with both `dtt` and `dtq` multiplicities. It is a very strong candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis represents **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n      (d) CH₃    (f) CH₃\n            |          |\n(g)CH₃-CH₂-(e)-CH(c) -- CH(b) -- COOH\n```\n*   **H(c) at C3:** Coupled to H(e) (2H -> t), H(d) (3H -> q), H(b) (1H -> d). This gives a **dtq**. (Matches one signal).\n*   **H(b) at C2:** Coupled to H(c) (1H -> d), H(f) (3H -> q). This gives a `dq`.\n*   No proton in this molecule is coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, there is **no `dtt` signal**. Structure B is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis represents **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n      (d) C₂H₅   (f) C₂H₅\n            |          |\n(g)CH₃-CH₂-(e)-CH(c) -- CH(b) -- COOH\n```\n*   **H(c) at C3:** Coupled to H(e) (2H -> t), CH₂ of ethyl group (d) (2H -> t), H(b) (1H -> d). This gives a **dtt**. (Matches one signal).\n*   Let's search for a `dtq`. We need a proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃. No such proton exists in this structure. For example, H(b) is coupled to H(c) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (f) (2H), giving a `dt`. Thus, there is **no `dtq` signal**. Structure C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis represents **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n      (d) CH₃   (f) CH₃\n            |         |\n(g)CH₃ -- (c)CH --- (b)CH --- (a)CH₂ --- COOH\n```\n*   **H(b) at C3:** Coupled to H(a) (2H -> t), H(c) (1H -> d), H(f) (3H -> q). This gives a `tqd`, which is equivalent to a `dtq`. (Matches one signal).\n*   **H(c) at C4:** This proton is part of an isopropyl group `(CH₃)₂CH-`. It is coupled to H(b) (1H -> d) and the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups (g and d) (6H -> septet). This gives a `doublet of septets`. There is **no `dtt` signal**. Structure D is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
