    "The user wants to determine the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principle:**\nThe interaction Lagrangian provided is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f X \\psi_f $$\nThis describes the interaction between the boson field X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ (where 'f' labels the type of fermion, e.g., an electron, a bottom quark, etc.). This interaction allows the boson X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$).\n\nFor a decay to be \"kinematically allowed,\" the mass of the initial particle (the boson X) must be greater than the sum of the masses of the final state particles (the fermion $f$ and its antiparticle $\\bar{f}$).\nLet $m_X$ be the mass of the boson X and $m_f$ be the mass of the fermion $f$. The mass of an antiparticle is the same as its corresponding particle, $m_{\\bar{f}} = m_f$.\nThe condition for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$ to be kinematically allowed is:\n$$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\n$$ m_X > 2m_f $$\n\n**2. List the Relevant Masses:**\nWe are given the mass of the boson X:\n*   $m_X = 6$ GeV\n\nNow, we need the masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to check which ones satisfy the kinematic condition.\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up (u): ~2.2 MeV = 0.0022 GeV\n    *   Down (d): ~4.7 MeV = 0.0047 GeV\n    *   Strange (s): ~95 MeV = 0.095 GeV\n    *   Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV\n    *   Bottom (b): ~4.18 GeV\n    *   Top (t): ~173 GeV\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV\n    *   Muon ($\\mu$): ~105.7 MeV = 0.1057 GeV\n    *   Tau ($\\tau$): ~1.777 GeV\n\n**3. Apply the Kinematic Condition:**\nWe need to find all fermions $f$ for which $m_X > 2m_f$, with $m_X = 6$ GeV. This is equivalent to finding all fermions with a mass $m_f < \\frac{m_X}{2} = 3$ GeV.\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   **Up (u):** $m_u \\approx 0.0022$ GeV. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   **Down (d):** $m_d \\approx 0.0047$ GeV. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   **Strange (s):** $m_s \\approx 0.095$ GeV. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   **Charm (c):** $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   **Bottom (b):** $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **forbidden**.\n    *   **Top (t):** $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **forbidden**.\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   **Electron (e):** $m_e \\approx 0.000511$ GeV. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   **Muon ($\\mu$):** $m_\\mu \\approx 0.1057$ GeV. Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   **Tau ($\\tau$):** $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n**4. Compile the List and Compare with Options:**\nThe complete list of kinematically allowed decays is:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$, $s\\bar{s}$, $u\\bar{u}$, $d\\bar{d}$, $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$, $e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nNow, we compare this list with the given options:\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$)\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and is missing allowed decays)\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (**Correct**, matches our derived list)\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes forbidden $t\\bar{t}$)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
