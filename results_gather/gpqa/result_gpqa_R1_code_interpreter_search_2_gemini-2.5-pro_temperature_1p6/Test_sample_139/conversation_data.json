    "Here is my reasoning process to solve this complex chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the problem statement into individual clues to analyze them one by one.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This immediately suggests the presence of isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc. Deuterium is a very common one in organic chemistry reagents.\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This indicates a highly exothermic and rapid reaction, typical of reagents like alkali metal hydrides or organometallics with protic substances like water.\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's list some possibilities for gas W:\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. **This is a perfect match.**\n        *   ⁴He (Helium gas): 2 protons and 2 neutrons. A possible match.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. N₂ has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. A match.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen gas): Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. O₂ has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. A match.\n        *   ¹²CD₄ (Deuterated methane): C (6p, 6n) + 4xD (1p, 1n) = 10 protons and 10 neutrons. A match.\n        *   ¹⁴ND₃ (Deuterated ammonia): N (7p, 7n) + 3xD (1p, 1n) = 10 protons and 10 neutrons. A match.\n        Given that X contains a heavy isotope (likely D), the formation of D₂ gas is a very strong possibility.\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G is formed, which, when heated, releases B.** This tells us G is likely an unstable compound that decomposes upon heating, like a hydroxide.\n    *   **Clue 5: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.** 277 K is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). **This is a near-perfect match, so B is almost certainly D₂O.**\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has a structure like R-C(=O)-(...)-COOH, which contains at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the keto group, two in the acid group). A reaction that reduces the number of oxygens from 3+ to 2 implies a powerful reduction. Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids. R-C(=O)-COOH would be reduced to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which has **2 oxygen atoms.** This is a very strong clue for the identity of X.\n    *   **Clue 7: Substance X and its very close analog are used as a reagent in organic chemistry.** This supports the idea of X being a common chemical reagent.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues and Form a Hypothesis:**\n\n    *   From Clue 5, B = D₂O.\n    *   From Clue 4, G releases B(D₂O) on heating. This is consistent with G being a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2M(OD)n -> M₂On + nD₂O.\n    *   From Clue 6, X must be a very powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The deuterated version of Lithium Aluminium Hydride, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description perfectly. Its analog, LiAlH₄, is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against all other clues.\n\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄):**\n\n    *   **Clue 1 (Heavy Isotope):** LiAlD₄ contains Deuterium. ✓ **Check.**\n    *   **Clue 7 (Organic Reagent):** LiAlD₄ and its analog LiAlH₄ are widely used. ✓ **Check.**\n    *   **Clue 6 (Keto Acid Reaction):** As established, LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid to a diol, which has 2 oxygen atoms. ✓ **Check.**\n    *   **The Reaction (Clues 2, 3, 4, 5):** Now let's see what happens when X (LiAlD₄) reacts with a liquid Y. For all parts of the puzzle to fit, especially the generation of D₂ gas and D₂O as final products, the reactants must provide only deuterium, not protium (normal hydrogen). Therefore, liquid Y must be **heavy water, D₂O.**\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n        *   **Clue 2 (Violent Reaction):** The reaction between LiAlH₄ and water is famously violent. The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be similarly violent. ✓ **Check.**\n        *   **Clue 3 (Gas W):** The gas produced is **D₂**. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (equal numbers). ✓ **Check.**\n        *   **Clue 4 (Precipitate G):** In the products, LiOD is soluble, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is an insoluble solid that would precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃. ✓ **Check.**\n        *   **Clue 5 (Heating G releases B):** Heating Aluminium Deuteroxide would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3**D₂O**(g). The released substance B is D₂O. The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. ✓ **Check.**\n\n    The hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** successfully explains every single clue in the problem.\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Li=3, Al=13, H=1.\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**. The heaviest element is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question includes a specific instruction: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Let's apply this instruction using integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes (D=2, Al=27).\n    *   **Contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are **four** instances of hydrogen (as Deuterium atoms) in LiAlD₄. According to the instruction, we must sum their masses.\n        *   Total mass from Hydrogen = Mass(D) + Mass(D) + Mass(D) + Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is **one** instance of Aluminium in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative (Summed) Mass:** The final step is to sum these two values.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
