    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5). The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the methoxy group (-OCH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone functional group (C=O) at C3 into a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)).\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction. It remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The hydride anion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible stereoisomers at C3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the starting molecule is chiral (C5 is S), the two products will be diastereomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces a mixture of **two** distinct diastereomeric compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This product molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and meso.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers are identical and represent a single meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, the reaction will produce all possible stereoisomers. The two chiral products, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), are enantiomers and will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of the first)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all 5 compounds produced (2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II).\n\n*   **Compound 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Compound 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Compound 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Compound 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Compound 5:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 3 and 4) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compounds 1 and 2) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   The meso compound (5) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair (3 and 4), so it will also be separated from them.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are constitutional isomers with different structures and polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n*   Counting the peaks:\n    1.  A peak for compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    2.  A peak for compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    3.  A peak for compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    4.  A single peak for the unresolved enantiomeric pair of compounds 3 and 4.\n*   Thus, there will be a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Each of the 5 compounds in the mixture is a unique stereoisomer and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Counting the peaks:\n    1.  A peak for compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    2.  A peak for compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    3.  A peak for compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    4.  A peak for compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    5.  A peak for compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   Thus, there will be a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
