    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Determining Mass Dimensions of Fields and Operators**\n\nIn natural units ($\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S$ is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has units of (length)$^4$. Since mass and length have inverse units in this system ($[M] \\sim [L]^{-1}$), the mass dimension of $d^4x$ is $[d^4x]_M = [M]^{-4}$.\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[M]^4$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}]_M = [M]^4$.\n\nNow, let's find the mass dimensions of the fields involved in the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$.\n\n**a) Fermion field $\\psi$**\n\nThe kinetic term for a fermion field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic, \\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. This term, being part of the Lagrangian density, must also have a mass dimension of 4. Let's focus on the derivative part, $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n*   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of $[M]^1$.\n*   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n*   Let $[\\psi]_M$ be the mass dimension of the fermion field $\\psi$. Since $\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0$, it has the same mass dimension as $\\psi$, so $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$.\n\nNow we can write the dimension equation for the kinetic term:\n$[\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\gamma^\\mu]_M [\\partial_\\mu]_M [\\psi]_M = [M]^4$\n$[\\psi]_M \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^1 \\cdot [\\psi]_M = [M]^4$\n$2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$\n$2[\\psi]_M = 3$\n$[\\psi]_M = [M]^{3/2}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the fermion field $\\psi$ (and $\\bar{\\psi}$) is $3/2$.\n\n**b) Electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**\n\nThe kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic, A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = [M]^4$\n$2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n$[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = [M]^2$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ is 2.\n\n**c) The operator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**\n\nThe operator is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, any combination of them, like their commutator, is also dimensionless.\n$[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = [M]^0$.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ using the interaction Lagrangian term $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. As a term in the Lagrangian density, its mass dimension must be 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M [\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M [\\psi]_M [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = [M]^4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot [M]^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot [M]^{3 + 2} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M \\cdot [M]^5 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = [M]^{4-5} = [M]^{-1}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **3. Determining Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by power-counting, which relies on the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the theory. The rule of thumb is:\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** Coupling constant has a positive mass dimension ($[g]_M > 0$).\n*   **Renormalizable:** Coupling constant is dimensionless ($[g]_M = 0$).\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** Coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ($[g]_M < 0$).\n\nIn this case, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. When a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, it means that at higher orders of perturbation theory, loop corrections will have divergences that become increasingly severe. To cancel these divergences, an infinite number of different counterterms would be required, making the theory predictive only as an effective field theory up to a certain energy scale. Such a theory is considered non-renormalizable.\n\nTherefore, the theory described by this interaction is not renormalizable.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
