    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Stoichiometric Reaction and Moles Calculation**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical reaction that occurs when iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, dissolves in a strong acid. The strong acid provides H+ ions, which react with the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3 in a neutralization reaction.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation tells us that 1 mole of solid Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ we want to dissolve:\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 * (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**2. Determining the Required Acidity (pH)**\n\nFor the Fe(OH)₃ to be considered \"dissolved\", the ion product ([Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³) must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Kₛₚ. To find the *minimum* amount of acid, we'll calculate the conditions exactly at the saturation point, where [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = Kₛₚ.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final solution:\n*   Moles of Fe³⁺ = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol (from the 1:1 stoichiometry between Fe(OH)₃ and Fe³⁺).\n*   Total volume of the solution = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n*   [Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10⁻³ M.\n\nThe solubility product constant (Kₛₚ) for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹. Now we can calculate the maximum hydroxide ion concentration ([OH⁻]) allowed in the solution for the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved:\nKₛₚ = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.3575 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n[OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.3575 x 10⁻³) = 2.9818 x 10⁻³⁷\n[OH⁻] = (2.9818 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.680 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nNow, we can find the pOH and then the pH of the resulting solution at 25°C, using the ion product of water, Kₗ = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.680 x 10⁻¹³) = 12.175\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 12.175 = 1.825\n\nSo, the pH of the final solution must be 1.825. This allows us to determine the required concentration of H⁺ ions in the final 100 cm³ solution:\n[H⁺]final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻¹·⁸²⁵ = 0.01496 M.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Acid Needed and Volume**\n\nThe total number of moles of H⁺ we need to add must accomplish two things:\n1.  React stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Remain in the solution to maintain the required final pH of 1.825.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for reaction (n_react)**: From step 1, n_react = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 9.3575 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 0.002807 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution (n_final)**: n_final = [H⁺]final * V_total = 0.01496 M * 0.1 L = 0.001496 mol.\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ required (n_total)**: n_total = n_react + n_final = 0.002807 mol + 0.001496 mol = 0.004303 mol.\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to supply this total amount of H⁺:\n*   Concentration of acid = 0.1 M = 0.1 mol/L\n*   Volume = n_total / Concentration = 0.004303 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04303 L\n\nConverting this volume to cm³:\nVolume = 0.04303 L * 1000 cm³/L = 43.03 cm³.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe minimum volume of the 0.1 M strong acid required is 43.03 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution will be 1.825.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nC) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nD) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nNone of the options perfectly match our calculated result (pH 1.83; 43.03 cm³). This discrepancy suggests that the Kₛₚ value used in the problem's source material might be different from the commonly cited value of ~2.8 x 10⁻³⁹. For instance, some sources list values as high as 4 x 10⁻³⁸. Using this higher Ksp would lead to a slightly higher final pH and a lower required acid volume, moving the result closer to option A. However, based on standard chemical data, none of the options are correct.\n\nIf we must choose the *best* option, it's possible that the question designers made an error and ignored the excess acid needed to maintain the final pH, only considering the stoichiometric amount. In that case:\n*   Moles of H+ for reaction only = 0.002807 mol\n*   Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³\nThis volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ in option A. Let's see if the pH of 2.04 in option A is plausible under this assumption.\n*   If we add 28.05 cm³ of acid, all of it reacts, and the only H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺. This would result in a pH around 2, which matches the pH in option A.\n\nTherefore, it appears the question likely made the common simplification of ignoring the amount of acid required to lower the pH of the final solution, considering only the stoichiometric reaction. Based on this interpretation, option A is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
