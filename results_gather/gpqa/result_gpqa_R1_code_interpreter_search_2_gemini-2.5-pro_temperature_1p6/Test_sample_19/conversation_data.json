    "This question is about identifying the core assumptions of the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the \"impulse approximation\" and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\nThe impulse approximation simplifies the complex problem of a projectile interacting with a many-body system (the nucleus) into a much simpler problem: the projectile interacting with a single, free nucleon. The name \"impulse\" suggests a very short, sharp interaction, like a hammer striking a bell.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions needed for this approximation to be valid:\n\n1.  **The interaction must be localized on a single nucleon.** If the interaction probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) simultaneously interacts with two or more nucleons (a phenomenon known as a meson-exchange current, or MEC), then the picture of a single nucleon being struck is invalid. Therefore, **Statement 1 (\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons\")** is a fundamental prerequisite for the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **The interaction time must be much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus.** The nucleons are bound together by the strong force and are constantly moving and interacting. For the struck nucleon to be treated as \"free,\" the interaction must happen so quickly that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the effect of the nuclear binding potential *during* the projectile-nucleon collision. This directly implies **Statement 4 (\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces\")**. The binding energy and potential are considered negligible compared to the energy transferred in the impulsive collision.\n\n3.  **The projectile and the ejected nucleon must not significantly interact with the other nucleons on their way in or out.** After the primary interaction, the scattered projectile and the struck nucleon must leave the nucleus without further collisions. If they re-scatter off other nucleons (these are called \"final-state interactions\" or FSIs), the final measured state will be different from what one would expect from a simple, single-nucleon event. The simplest form of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA) assumes there are no such FSIs. This is captured by **Statement 2 (\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon\")**.\n\n4.  Now let's consider **Statement 3 (\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic\")**. This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is a model for how a *nucleon as a whole* behaves within a *nucleus*. It is concerned with the relationship between the nucleon and its nuclear environment, not the sub-structure of the nucleon. Whether the quarks inside the nucleon are relativistic or not is a separate physics question, relevant to understanding the nucleon's form factors but not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be and is used in regimes where the momentum transfer is high and nucleons (and their constituent quarks) must be treated relativistically. Therefore, Statement 3 is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are that the interaction happens with a single nucleon (1), the binding forces are negligible during the interaction (4), and the rest of the nucleus is essentially a spectator that doesn't interfere (2).\n\nThus, the correct combination of statements is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
