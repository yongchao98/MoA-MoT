    "This is a classic problem involving exponential decay, which is a \"memoryless\" process. Let's break down the reasoning.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Decay**\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability of an atom decaying in a given time interval is constant, regardless of how long the atom has already existed. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay.\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Model**\nLet T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom has not decayed by time *t* (i.e., it survives past time *t*) is given by the survival function:\nP(T > t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time *t* is:\nP(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. We can write this as:\nP(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nWe can solve for λ, but it's easier to keep e^(-100λ) as a known value for now.\n\n**4. Formulate the Question**\nWe are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nIn mathematical terms, we want to find:\nP(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)\n\n**5. Apply the Memoryless Property**\nBecause the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in its first 150 minutes.\nSo, the problem simplifies to calculating:\nP(T ≤ 150)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Probability**\nWe need to calculate P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\nWe can find the value of this expression using our result from Step 3 (e^(-100λ) = 0.68).\n\ne^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our probability formula:\nP(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nTo get the numerical value, we'll use a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of 0.68 raised to the power of 1.5\nval = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The probability of decay is 1 minus this value\nprobability = 1 - val\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{probability * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n>>>\n43.93%\n\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential decay law. A crucial characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\". Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Model**\n\nThe probability that an atom survives past a time `t` is given by the survival function:\n`P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `T` is the lifetime of the atom and `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays *by* time `t` is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF):\n`P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**3. Use the Given Data to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find a value related to our decay constant.\n\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nSolving for the exponential term:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nThis term, `e^(-100λ)`, represents the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes. We can use this relationship to solve the main question without needing to find the exact value of `λ`.\n\n**4. Formulate the Question Mathematically**\n\nWe want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived 50 minutes.\nThis is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\n**5. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nAs stated in step 1, the process is memoryless. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in its first 150 minutes.\n\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to calculating `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\nWe can relate `e^(-150λ)` to the term we found in step 3, `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, using exponent rules:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow substitute the value we found:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`:\n`(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nFinally, calculate the probability of decay:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n**7. Convert to Percentage and Choose the Answer**\n\nThe probability is 0.4393, which is equivalent to 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nThe python code from the initial thinking process confirms this calculation:\n```python\nimport math\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(f\"{probability * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nOutput: `43.93%`\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the \"Memoryless\" Property of Radioactive Decay**\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability that an atom will decay in a given future time interval is independent of its past history. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"closer\" to decaying. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n\n**2. Simplify the Problem**\nBecause of the memoryless property, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**3. Define the Decay Formula**\nThe probability `P` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom *survives* past time `t` is `e^(-λt)`.\n\n**4. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant's Term**\nWe are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nWe don't need to solve for `λ` itself; we can use the value of `e^(-100λ)` directly.\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\nWe can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` using our known term from step 4:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value `0.68` for `e^(-100λ)`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**6. Compute the Numerical Answer**\nThe calculation from the previous step confirmed that:\n`(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nNow, we can find the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**7. Final Answer Selection**\nConverting the probability to a percentage, we get `0.4393 * 100 = 43.93%`.\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
