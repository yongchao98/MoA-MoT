    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis\n\n**Goal:** Identify which compound, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Key Concept:** Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is a chemical equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process requires a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, known as an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen).\n\n1.  **Analyze Benzoquinone:**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   Let's examine the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons). These α-carbons are part of the C=C double bonds.\n    *   Each of these α-carbons is bonded to another carbon within the ring (via a double bond) and the carbon of the carbonyl group. They have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n     ![Structure of Benzoquinone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/1%2C4-Benzoquinone.svg/150px-1%2C4-Benzoquinone.svg.png) \n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are saturated (CH₂ groups).\n    *   Let's examine the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to two carbonyl groups each.\n    *   Each of these carbons (C2, C4, C6) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These are available α-hydrogens.\n    *   The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the molecule to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound and therefore very stable. The equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n     ![Tautomerism of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/P/phloroglucinol01.png) \n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis\n\n**Goal:** Identify which compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Key Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 atom is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl Fumarate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioate.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. Carbons involved in a double bond cannot be chiral centers.\n    *   There are no other carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry), which makes it achiral. If you trace a line from any atom through the center of the C=C bond, you will find an identical atom at the same distance on the opposite side.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
