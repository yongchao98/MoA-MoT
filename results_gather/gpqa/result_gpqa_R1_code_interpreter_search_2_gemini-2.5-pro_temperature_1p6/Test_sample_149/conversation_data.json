    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation suggests a double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule (1+2=3 peaks -> triplet). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment. The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The signal is a doublet (d), confirming it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks -> doublet). This further supports the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable with trace acid/water, causing the signal to be broad.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The two substituents are the amino group (-NH2) and the ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The structure is consistent with all the given data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **1. NaNO2 + HCl:** This is a standard **diazotization reaction**. It converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N2+Cl-.\n    The product is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **2. H2O:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water. This is a hydrolysis reaction (a variation of the Sandmeyer reaction) that replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). These are the conditions for a **base-catalyzed aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Addition):** The nucleophilic enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product after protonation.\n            The aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n\n             \n\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group at C-3 and the acidic proton at C-2 are removed, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This dehydration step is called condensation.\n\n            The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The formation of the C=C bond creates a large, conjugated system (conjugated with both the C=O group and one of the aromatic rings), which is thermodynamically very stable. This stability drives the reaction to completion.\n\n            The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option D).\n\n             \n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product of the entire reaction sequence. While the aldol addition product (Option C) is formed as an intermediate, the application of heat in the final step ensures that the dehydration (condensation) reaction occurs to yield the more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
