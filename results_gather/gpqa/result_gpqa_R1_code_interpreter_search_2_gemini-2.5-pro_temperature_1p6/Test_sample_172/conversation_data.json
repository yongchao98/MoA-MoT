    "This problem requires us to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum for a relativistic particle.\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Speed of the electron, `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`. This speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s), so we must use relativistic mechanics.\n*   Uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m`.\n\n**2. State the relevant physical principles:**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** for position and momentum states: `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s`). This principle gives us a way to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`) from the given uncertainty in position (`Δx`).\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`. To find the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`) and the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`), we can find the derivative of energy with respect to momentum, `dE/dp`.\n\n**3. Derive the relationship between ΔE and Δp:**\nDifferentiating the energy-momentum equation with respect to `p`:\n`d/dp(E²) = d/dp[(pc)² + (m₀c²)²]`\n`2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c²`\n`dE/dp = pc² / E`\n\nFrom special relativity, we also know that relativistic momentum `p = γm₀v` and relativistic energy `E = γm₀c²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\nSubstituting these into our expression for `dE/dp`:\n`dE/dp = (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) = v`\n\nThis gives us a simple and powerful relationship: `dE/dp = v`. For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as `ΔE / Δp ≈ v`, which means `ΔE ≈ v * Δp`.\n\n**4. Calculation Steps:**\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    From the uncertainty principle, the minimum uncertainty is `Δp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    Using the relationship we derived, `ΔE_min ≈ v * Δp_min`.\n    Substituting `Δp_min` from Step 1, we get `ΔE_min ≈ v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Substitute the numerical values and compute the result.**\nWe can use a python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\nv = 2e8  # Speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # Uncertainty in position in m\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_p_min = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p_min = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# Delta_E ~ v * Delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p_min\n\nprint(f\"The minimum uncertainty in momentum is {delta_p_min:.3e} kg.m/s\")\nprint(f\"The minimum uncertainty in energy is {delta_E:.3e} J\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> The minimum uncertainty in momentum is 5.273e-25 kg.m/s\n> The minimum uncertainty in energy is 1.055e-16 J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is `1.055 * 10⁻¹⁶ J`.\n\n**5.
