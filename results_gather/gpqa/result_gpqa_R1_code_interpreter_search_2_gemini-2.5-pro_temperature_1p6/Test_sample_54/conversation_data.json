    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\n    First, let's sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    Integration: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Proposed Structures based on the Proton Count:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate** (CH3COOCH=CHCH3): The molecular formula is C5H8O2. It contains 3+1+1+3 = 8 hydrogens. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3): The molecular formula is C6H10O2. It contains 3+1+1+2+3 = 10 hydrogens. This does not match the data.\n\n    Based on the total number of protons, we can immediately eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate (B)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (A)**. The correct answer must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Assign the Signals to the Propenyl Acetate Structure:**\n    Let's analyze the structure of propenyl acetate: CH3(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d).\n\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet with an integration of 3H in the 2.0-2.2 ppm range is characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH3COO-). This corresponds to the protons labeled **H(a)**. It is a singlet because there are no protons on adjacent atoms.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet with an integration of 3H around 1.6-1.8 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a double bond (-C=C-CH3). It is a doublet because it is split by the single proton on the adjacent carbon, H(c). This corresponds to the protons labeled **H(d)**.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to a vinylic proton (a proton on a C=C double bond). The multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one proton and a group of three protons. This matches proton **H(c)**, which is coupled to H(b) (giving the doublet) and the three H(d) protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):** This is the second vinylic proton. It is significantly downfield (deshielded) because it is attached to the electronegative oxygen atom (-O-CH=). It appears as a doublet because it is only coupled to the other vinylic proton, H(c). This corresponds to proton **H(b)**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n    *   For **trans** isomers, the coupling constant between the vinylic protons (³J_trans) is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For **cis** isomers, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n    The provided data for the signal at 7.0 ppm (H(b)) shows it is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large coupling constant falls squarely within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, and splitting patterns) are consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons definitively indicates a trans stereochemistry. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
