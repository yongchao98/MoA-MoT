  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the C=O stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's assemble the side chain.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives a `CH₃-CH₂-` fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This gives a `CH₃-CH-` fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this must be the -CH₂- group of the ethyl part. It is adjacent to the CH₃ (3 protons) and likely another proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the -CH- proton. Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ group (3 protons, giving the doublet at 1.4 ppm) and the adjacent -CH₂- group (2 protons).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments `CH₃-CH₂-` and `CH₃-CH-` are connected through the -CH- and -CH₂- groups. The -CH- group is attached to the ring. This forms a sec-butyl group: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** Putting all the pieces together, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P / HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **The Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will not be affected by this reagent.\n        *   Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure; it's still a carboxylic acid.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product of the reduction.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
