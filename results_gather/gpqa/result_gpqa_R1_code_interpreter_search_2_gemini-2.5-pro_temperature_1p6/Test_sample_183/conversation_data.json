    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at C2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe three substituents are adjacent (1,2,3-substitution). This is a sterically crowded arrangement that is often difficult to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\nLet's consider the directing effects of these groups:\n*   **-OEt**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, meta- director.\n\nDirectly substituting onto a disubstituted ring would not lead to this product. For instance, nitrating 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene would place the nitro group at C4 or C6, not C3. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, likely involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is most likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This requires sodium hydroxide and an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr).\n    *   Precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   Reaction: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + NaOH, then EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n*   **Making the Phenol:** A phenol is often made from a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   Precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   Reaction: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), then H3O+/Heat (hydrolysis) → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Making the Key Aniline Intermediate:** The core of the problem is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   Structure: -NH2 at C1, -tBu at C2, -NO2 at C3.\n    *   Direct routes to this are not feasible. We cannot simply add these groups to benzene. This strongly implies the use of a **blocking group** (like -SO3H, which can be added and later removed) and a sequence of functional group manipulations.\n\n**3. Propose a Forward Synthesis using the Available Reagents**\n\nLet's look at the reagents provided in the options. They all contain the same set: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `HNO3/H2SO4` (x2), `SO3/H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+/Heat`, `dilute H2SO4`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nHere is a logical pathway that leads to the target molecule:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** Use a sulfonic acid group to block the para position, which is sterically favored.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **First Nitration:** Now nitrate the ring. Both the -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position.\n    *   4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` → **4-tert-Butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Structure: -SO3H at C1, -NO2 at C3, -tBu at C4.\n\n4.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-Butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `Fe/HCl` → **3-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Structure: -SO3H at C1, -NH2 at C3, -tBu at C4.\n\n5.  **Second Nitration:** This is a crucial step. We nitrate again. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+), which is a meta-director.\n    *   Intermediate: 3-Anilinium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   Let's check the directing effects for an electrophile:\n        *   -SO3H (at C1, m-director) → directs to C5.\n        *   -NH3+ (at C3, m-director) → directs to C5.\n        *   -tBu (at C4, o,p-director) → directs to C5 (ortho position; C3 and para C1 are blocked).\n    *   All three groups direct the second nitro group to C5.\n    *   Product: **3-Amino-4-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n6.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt.\n    *   3-Amino-4-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `NaNO2/HCl` → Diazonium salt intermediate.\n\n7.  **Hydrolysis to Phenol:** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group.\n    *   Diazonium salt + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` → **3-Hydroxy-4-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Structure: -SO3H at C1, -OH at C3, -tBu at C4, -NO2 at C5.\n\n8.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking):** Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group.\n    *   3-Hydroxy-4-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H2SO4` → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (After removing the -SO3H group from C1, renumbering the ring starting from the -OH group as C1 gives this structure).\n\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether.\n    *   2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the target molecule.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe sequence of steps derived above is complex but chemically sound. Now we must find the option that represents this sequence. The options list the reagents, but the order appears scrambled in the question text. We should look for the option that contains the correct set of reagents and has the most logical ordering, particularly for the critical final steps.\n\n*   My derived correct sequence of reaction types: Alkylation → Sulfonation → Nitration → Reduction → Nitration → Diazotization → Hydrolysis → Desulfonation → Etherification.\n*   My derived required reagent order (referencing the steps in Option B): `i, ii, iii, iv, vi, v, vii, viii, ix`. The order of `v` and `vi` is swapped in Option B as written.\n\nLet's re-examine the sequence *as written* in Option B: `i → ii → iii → iv → v → vi → vii → viii → ix`.\nThis involves nitrating a diazonium salt (step vi). Let's check the directing effects for that specific step (nitrating 3-diazonio-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid):\n*   -SO3H (at C1, m-director) → C5.\n*   -N2+ (at C3, m-director) → C5.\n*   -tBu (at C4, o,p-director) → C5.\nAll directors point to C5. The nitration would yield **3-diazonio-4-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Subsequent hydrolysis (vii), desulfonation (viii), and etherification (ix) would still lead to the same final product.\n\nTherefore, whether we nitrate the amine (in its ammonium form) and then diazotize, or diazotize first and then nitrate the diazonium salt, the regiochemical outcome of the second nitration is the same. The pathway works. The reagent list in option B is correct for this complex synthesis. While there might be ambiguity in the order of the middle steps (iv, v, vi), the overall strategy is encapsulated within this set of reagents. The other options either contain nonsensical final steps (e.g., sulfonating the final product in C) or start with a non-viable reaction (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on nitrobenzene implied in D). Option B presents the only plausible set of reagents and overall strategy, especially the key final steps: `vii) H2O/Heat → viii) dilute H2SO4 → ix) NaOH/EtBr` (hydrolysis → desulfonation → etherification).\n\n<<<B>>>"
