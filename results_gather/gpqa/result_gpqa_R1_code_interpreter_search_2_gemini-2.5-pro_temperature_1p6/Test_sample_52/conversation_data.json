    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Fragments from the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring with two substituents and four protons attached to it. The molecular fragment is C6H4. The aromatic nature of the ring accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR: Ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O double bond in the ester adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons, one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3`, which has a formula of C3H5. The C=C double bond adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR - Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for -CH3 groups.\n        *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring as the core.\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   The other substituent must be the ester group and it must also contain the second -CH3 group, with no -CH2- groups. There are two common ways to achieve this:\n        *   **Possibility 1: Methyl Ester.** The substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, `-COOCH3`.\n        *   **Possibility 2: Acetate Ester.** The substituent is an acetoxy group, `-O-CO-CH3`.\n\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular formula for both possibilities:\n        *   **Structure 1:** (propenyl) - C6H4 - (COOCH3) -> e.g., Methyl 4-propenylbenzoate\n            *   Carbons: 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from COO) + 1 (from OCH3) = 11 carbons.\n            *   Hydrogens: 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from ring) + 3 (from OCH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n            *   Oxygens: 2 (from COO).\n            *   The formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n        *   **Structure 2:** (propenyl) - C6H4 - (OOCCH3) -> e.g., 4-Propenylphenyl acetate\n            *   Carbons: 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from ring) + 2 (from OOCCH3) = 11 carbons.\n            *   Hydrogens: 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from ring) + 3 (from OOCCH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n            *   Oxygens: 2 (from OOC).\n            *   The formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   Both structures that perfectly match all the spectroscopic details have the same molecular formula: C11H12O2.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n    *   The structure we deduced has a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n        *   **A) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**. (Matches)\n        *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Mismatch)\n        *   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. (Matches DoU, but see step 4)\n        *   **D) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Mismatch, not enough unsaturation for all the required groups)\n\n4.  **Final Elimination:**\n\n    *   We are left with options A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2) based on DoU.\n    *   However, our structural analysis based on the NMR fragments led directly to the formula C11H12O2.\n    *   To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, one would need to add a CH2 group. For example, changing the methyl ester (-COOCH3) to an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would add a CH2.\n    *   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This directly contradicts the changes needed to form a plausible C12H14O2 structure that also fits the other NMR signals.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible formula that fits all the given information is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
