    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to place a bromine atom on the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, which is an α-haloketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate (a cyclopropane ring fused to a cyclopentane ring). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the cyclopropane ring opens to form a more stable carbanion. The ring contracts, leading to the formation of a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the reagent for this transformation, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic, selective reduction reaction. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, **Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde (-CHO) group.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 (1 on the aldehyde, 1 on the carbon attached to the aldehyde, and 8 on the other four carbons of the ring).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** We analyze the molecule for symmetry to determine which hydrogens are chemically equivalent. Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the rest of the ring.\n\n    ```\n          C3--C4\n         /      \\\n        C2--------C5\n         \\      /\n           \\ C1 /\n             |\n            CHO\n    ```\n\n    This plane of symmetry makes:\n    *   Carbon C2 equivalent to Carbon C5.\n    *   Carbon C3 equivalent to Carbon C4.\n\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogen signals:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is a methine proton (CH) attached directly to the ring and the aldehyde group. It is unique. (1 signal)\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent due to symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by symmetry) because they are on a prochiral center in a molecule with a chiral center (C1 is a stereocenter). The same applies to the two protons on C5. The symmetry plane makes one proton on C2 equivalent to one on C5, and the other proton on C2 equivalent to the other on C5. This results in two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 signals)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the protons on C4. This gives another two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 signals)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct signals: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5-H's) + 2 (from C3/C4-H's) = **6** distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe final product has 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
