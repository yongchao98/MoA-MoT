    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   **System:** A spin-1/2 particle. Its spin is described by the spin operator `S = (S_x, S_y, S_z)`.\n*   **Magnetic Moment:** The magnetic moment `μ` is proportional to the spin: `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   **Initial Magnetic Field:** The magnetic field `B_initial` is uniform and points in the +Z direction: `B_initial = B ẑ`.\n*   **Hamiltonian (t < 0):** The energy of the particle in the magnetic field is given by the Hamiltonian `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γS · (B ẑ) = -γB S_z`.\n*   **State:** The problem states the particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". In quantum mechanics, this means the system is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down).\n    *   Energy for spin-up (`m_s = +1/2`): `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Energy for spin-down (`m_s = -1/2`): `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state. Therefore, at `t=0`, the particle is in the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`. Let's denote this state as `|+Z>`.\n*   **Initial Expectation Value:** At `t=0`, the expectation value of `S_z` is `<S_z>(0) = <+Z|S_z|+Z> = ħ/2`. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(0) = γ<S_z>(0) = γħ/2`.\n\n### 2. The Change and Subsequent Evolution (t > 0)\n\n*   **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the +Y direction: `B_new = B ŷ`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):** The system's evolution is now governed by the new Hamiltonian `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γS · (B ŷ) = -γB S_y`.\n*   **Time Evolution:** According to the Schrödinger equation, the state of the system evolves as `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+Z> = exp(iγB S_y t/ħ) |+Z>`.\n*   **Larmor Precession:** This setup describes the Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the direction of the new magnetic field (the Y-axis) with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n*   **Larmor Frequency:** The Larmor frequency is given by `ω_L = γB`. (Sometimes a negative sign is included depending on the convention for the charge, but since we are looking for the magnitude of the oscillation frequency, this is not critical).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Observable `<μ_z>(t)`\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment as a function of time: `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n\nLet's use the classical picture of Larmor precession which is valid for expectation values (Ehrenfest's theorem).\n\n*   **Initial Spin Vector:** At `t=0`, the spin vector points entirely along the Z-axis: `<S>(0) = (0, 0, ħ/2)`.\n*   **Precession:** For `t > 0`, this vector `<S>(t)` will precess around the Y-axis with angular frequency `ω = γB`. The rotation of a vector `(0, 0, c)` around the y-axis by an angle `θ = ωt` is given by:\n    *   `<S_x>(t) = c * sin(θ) = (ħ/2)sin(ωt)`\n    *   `<S_y>(t) = 0` (The component along the axis of rotation remains unchanged, and it was initially 0).\n    *   `<S_z>(t) = c * cos(θ) = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n*   **Oscillation of the Z-component:** From the above, the expectation value of `S_z` is:\n    ` <S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos((γB)t) `\n*   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    ` <μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t) `\n\n### 4. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for `<μ_z>(t)` is a cosine function. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(Ωt + φ)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `Ω`.\n\nIn our case, `<μ_z>(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)`.\n\nBy comparing the forms, the angular frequency of the oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which in this context is the angular frequency.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
