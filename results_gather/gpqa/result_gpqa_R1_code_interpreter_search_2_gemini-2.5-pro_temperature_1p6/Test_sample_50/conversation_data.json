    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the System:**\n    The problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system (the charge `q` plus the sphere with its induced charges).\n\n2.  **The Method of Images:**\n    This problem is a classic electrostatic problem that is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" The core idea is to replace the complex system of the sphere and its induced surface charges with a simpler, equivalent system. We can replace the sphere with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. This replacement is valid for calculating the electric field and potential *outside* the original sphere's volume.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    The image charge `q'` and its position `b` must be chosen such that the potential on the surface where the sphere used to be (a spherical surface of radius `R`) is zero, satisfying the \"grounded\" condition. Standard derivations in electromagnetism show that for a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center, the equivalent image charge is:\n    *   Magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Position: `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the line connecting the center to `q`).\n\n    So, our original system (charge `q` and the grounded sphere) is now replaced by a much simpler system of two point charges:\n    *   The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n    *   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    There are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n    **Method 1: Using the definition of potential energy (`U = (1/2) Σ qV`)**\n    The total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. So:\n    `U = (1/2) * (q * V_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere)`\n\n    *   `V_sphere` is the potential of the sphere, which is 0 because it is grounded. So, the second term `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere` is zero.\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    The potential created by the induced charges at the location `d` is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location. Let's calculate this potential:\n    *   The potential at distance `d` from the center due to the image charge `q'` (which is at distance `b = R^2/d`) is:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substitute the values for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    *   Simplify the denominator: `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n        `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method 2: Work Done to Assemble the System**\n    The potential energy is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the energy is zero) to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. The force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (for `x > R`) is the attractive force from the grounded sphere, which is equal to the force from its image charge.\n    *   Force on `q`: `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` (This is an attractive force, hence the negative sign if x is positive).\n    *   The work done `U` is `∫ F_ext ⋅ dx` from ∞ to `d`. `F_ext = -F(x)`.\n    *   `U = ∫(∞ to d) [-F(x)] dx = ∫(d to ∞) F(x) dx`\n    *   `U = ∫(d to ∞) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   Performing this integration (using a u-substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`) yields the same result:\n        `U = [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (x^2 - R^2) ]` from `d` to `∞`\n        `U = 0 - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The potential energy is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere. The system is in a bound state.\n\n    The final expression is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
