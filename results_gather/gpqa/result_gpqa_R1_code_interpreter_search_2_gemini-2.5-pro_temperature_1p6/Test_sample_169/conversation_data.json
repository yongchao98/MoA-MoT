    "An electron is in the spin state given by the spinor `|ψ⟩`. A spinor is a two-component column vector. The given state is `(3i, 4)`, which can be written as:\n`|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\nwhere `T` denotes the transpose, so it's a column vector.\n\nThe spin operator in the y-direction is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (hbar) and `σ_y` is the Pauli-y matrix.\n`σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated using the formula:\n`⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nIn this case, `A = S_y`, so we need to calculate:\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n\nLet's break down the calculation into steps.\n\n**1. Define the ket `|ψ⟩` and the bra `⟨ψ|`**\nThe ket is the column vector:\n`|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`\n\nThe bra `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket:\n`⟨ψ| = [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**2. Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**\nThis is the inner product of the state with itself.\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, we have:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**3. Calculate the term `S_y|ψ⟩`**\nFirst, we apply the `S_y` operator to the ket `|ψ⟩`.\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, 3i² ]^T`\n`S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T`\n\n**4. Calculate the numerator `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`**\nNow we take the inner product of the bra `⟨ψ|` with the result from step 3.\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T )`\nWe can pull the constant `ħ/2` out.\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( 12(-1) - 12 )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`\n\n**5. Calculate the final expectation value `⟨S_y⟩`**\nNow, we divide the result from step 4 by the result from step 2.\n`⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n`⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\n\nUsing `hbar` for `ħ`, the result is `-12*hbar/25`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) 25*hbar/2\nC) -12*hbar/25\nD) 12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\nTo verify the result, let's use python.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the spin state vector (ket)\n# Using 1j for the imaginary unit i\npsi_ket = np.array([[3j], [4]])\n\n# Define the bra (conjugate transpose of the ket)\npsi_bra = psi_ket.conj().T\n\n# Define the Pauli-y matrix\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], \n                    [1j,  0]])\n\n# The spin operator S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y\n# We can calculate the expectation value of sigma_y first,\n# and then multiply by hbar/2 at the end.\n\n# Calculate the normalization factor <psi|psi>\nnorm_factor = np.dot(psi_bra, psi_ket)[0, 0]\n# norm_factor = (-3j)*(3j) + 4*4 = -9j^2 + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\n# Calculate the numerator <psi|sigma_y|psi>\n# First, calculate sigma_y|psi>\nsigma_y_psi = np.dot(sigma_y, psi_ket)\n# sigma_y_psi = [[0, -1j], [1j, 0]] @ [[3j], [4]] = [[-4j], [-3]]\n\n# Then, calculate <psi|sigma_y|psi>\nnumerator = np.dot(psi_bra, sigma_y_psi)[0, 0]\n# numerator = [-3j, 4] @ [[-4j], [-3]] = (-3j)*(-4j) + 4*(-3) = 12j^2 - 12 = -24\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of sigma_y\nexp_sigma_y = numerator / norm_factor\n\n# The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * <sigma_y>\n# So, <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (-24 / 25) = -12*hbar / 25\n\n# Print the fraction for <S_y> without hbar\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nresult_fraction = Fraction(exp_sigma_y.real).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(f\"The expectation value of sigma_y is: {numerator.real}/{norm_factor.real} = {exp_sigma_y.real}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * ({numerator.real}/{norm_factor.real}) = {int(numerator.real/2)}*hbar/{int(norm_factor.real)}\")\nprint(f\"Comparing this with option C: -12*hbar/25.
