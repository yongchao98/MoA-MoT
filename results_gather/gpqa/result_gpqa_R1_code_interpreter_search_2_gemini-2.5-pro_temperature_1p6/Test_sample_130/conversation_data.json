    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR (indicating two equivalent vinylic protons) and two peaks in the ¹³C NMR at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This is the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with a C₅ ring, two double bonds, and four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4). The C5 carbon is a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The C1-C4 portion of the diene reacts with the two carbons of the alkene in maleic anhydride to form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   The CH₂ group (C5) from the diene becomes a one-carbon bridge (the C7 bridge) in the bicyclic product.\n    *   The reaction produces two stereoisomers: an *endo* product and an *exo* product.\n    *   According to the **endo rule**, the kinetically favored product (and therefore usually the major product) is the *endo* isomer. The thermodynamically more stable *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo) and Spatial Proximity:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C7-CH₂ bridge. This places the two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them **H_anhydride**) spatially close to the protons of the C7-CH₂ bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) with respect to the C7-CH₂ bridge. This means the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent in the minor product.\n    *   Based on our stereochemical analysis, this specific cross-peak must be due to the interaction between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **H_bridge** protons, as this proximity exists only in the major (*endo*) isomer.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    Now we need to assign the chemical shifts and multiplicities given in the options to the specific protons in the product structure. The product contains several types of protons:\n    *   **H_anhydride (2H):** These are the two protons on the former maleic anhydride part. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so they will be shifted downfield. They are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet**. A shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **H_bridge (2H):** These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (in a different chemical environment) and will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as a pair of doublets. They are on a saturated carbon, so their shift will be relatively low. The description **a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** perfectly matches one of these bridge protons.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (6H):** These are the two methyl groups on the newly formed double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be in the vinyl region, around **~1.7 ppm**. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (6H):** These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (saturated carbons). They are equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. They are on saturated carbons and should be the most upfield signal, around **~1 ppm**. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Identify the Cross-Peak:**\n    *   We established that the key NOE interaction distinguishing the major product is between **H_anhydride** and **H_bridge**.\n    *   We assigned the signal for **H_anhydride** as the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   We assigned the signal for one of the **H_bridge** protons as the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    The cross-peak connects the \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" and the \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\". This corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H). Plausible, but this interaction would exist in both isomers and is not the key differentiator described.\n*   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the major (*endo*) product and weak/absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This matches the problem statement.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me). These are on adjacent carbons and would show an NOE, but in both isomers.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H). These protons are far apart in the major (*endo*) product and close in the minor (*exo*) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\n<<<B>>>"
