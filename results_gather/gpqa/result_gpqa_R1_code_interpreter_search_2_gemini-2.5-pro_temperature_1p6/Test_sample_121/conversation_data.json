    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar in outcome to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-protons (on the CH3 group) of acetic acid are acidic and can be replaced by bromine. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the reaction, and heating provides the necessary energy.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid is brominated at the alpha-carbon.\n    CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (alpha-bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with the alcohol (ethanol) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (sulfuric acid) to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl bromoacetate) + H2O\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) + NaBr\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process to form a cyclic compound.\n    1.  **First deprotonation and alkylation:** The CH2 group in ethyl cyanoacetate is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and -COOEt), making its protons acidic. The strong base, NaH, deprotonates the alpha-carbon to form a carbanion (enolate).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n        This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    2.  **Second deprotonation and cyclization:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the intermediate product, which still has one acidic alpha-proton.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n        The resulting carbanion then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This cyclization forms a six-membered ring (the alpha-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nLet's break down the molecule:\n\n1.  **Ethoxy Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent to each other. They will appear as one signal (a triplet).\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are equivalent to each other. They will appear as a second signal (a quartet).\n    *   **Total signals from the ethoxy group = 2.**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry has important consequences for the equivalence of the ring protons.\n    *   Due to this plane:\n        *   C2 and C6 are chemically equivalent.\n        *   C3 and C5 are chemically equivalent.\n        *   C4 is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry.\n        *   C1 has no protons.\n    *   Now let's consider the protons on each unique carbon position:\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** Each of these carbons has two protons (e.g., axial and equatorial in a chair conformation). Because the molecule is substituted at C1, these two protons on C2 (or C6) are not equivalent; they are *diastereotopic*. Therefore, they give two distinct signals. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, this results in two signals, each corresponding to two protons (e.g., H2-ax/H6-ax and H2-eq/H6-eq). **(2 signals)**\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similar to C2/C6, the two protons on C3 (or C5) are diastereotopic. Since C3 and C5 are equivalent, this also results in two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic because their relationship to the C1 substituents is different. Thus, they give two separate signals, each corresponding to one proton. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Total signals from the cyclohexane ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.**\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethoxy group and the cyclohexane ring:\nTotal Signals = 2 (from ethoxy group) + 6 (from ring) = 8.\n\nThere will be 8 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
