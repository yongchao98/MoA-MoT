    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The species present are:\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free `Co^2+` concentration, `[Co^2+]`, the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN-]`, and the overall stability constants (β).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Formulate the mole fraction (α):** The percentage of a specific complex is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. We are interested in `α2` for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 2 and 3, we get:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + ...)`\n\n    We can factor out `[Co^2+]` from the denominator, which then cancels out with the numerator:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means that only a fraction of the thiocyanate will be used to form complexes. For simplification, we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate `[SCN-]` at equilibrium is approximately equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n6.  **Calculate the mole fraction:** Now, we can plug the given values into the formula for `α2`.\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\nI will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the mole fraction equation, often denoted as the alpha function Φ or the sum S.\n# S = 1 (for free Co2+) + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*scn_conc + beta2*(scn_conc**2) + beta3*(scn_conc**3) + beta4*(scn_conc**4)\n\n# The term for the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2], in the sum.\nnumerator_term = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The mole fraction (α2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex.\nalpha2 = numerator_term / denominator\n\n# The percentage of the [Co(SCN)2] complex.\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n# Print the output to the console\nprint(output)\n```\nThe calculation yields a result of 16.9%. This value corresponds directly to one of the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we first need to find its mole fraction (`α2`) relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:** The species in solution are the free hydrated cobalt ion `Co(H2O)6^2+` (abbreviated as `Co^2+`) and the various thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\n2.  **Define the mole fraction:** The mole fraction of a specific species `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)` is given by its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`. For the dithiocyanato complex (`n=2`), the mole fraction `α2` is:\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n3.  **Use stability constants to relate concentrations:** The concentrations of the complexes are related to the free cobalt ion `[Co^2+]` and free thiocyanate ion `[SCN-]` concentrations through the overall stability constants (β):\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n    Substituting the expressions based on the stability constants:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+](1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the mole fraction equation:** Now, we can write the formula for `α2` by substituting the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+](1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving an equation that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` and the stability constants:\n    `α2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:** The initial total concentration of thiocyanate (`[SCN-]total = 0.1 M`) is ten times the total concentration of cobalt (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`). Since the ligand is in significant excess, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate, `[SCN-]`, with its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n6.  **Calculate the mole fraction:** Now we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    First, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   `β1[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    Sum the denominator:\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term for `[Co(SCN)2]`:\n    Numerator = `β2[SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\n    Calculate `α2`:\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the mole fraction by 100:\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the value from the code output.\n\n<<<C>>>"
