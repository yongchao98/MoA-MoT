    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will act as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Ketone and Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is **2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**. Let's identify the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group C=O). These are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, can only abstract the proton from C6. This is the only possible site for deprotonation to form an enolate. The resulting enolate will have a double bond between C1 (the carbonyl carbon) and C6.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The formed enolate is the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is **C6**.\n    *   Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the Michael acceptor. The electrophilic site is the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The electrons rearrange to reform the ketone's carbonyl group and generate an intermediate carbanion α to the ester group.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Final Product (A):**\n    *   The carbanion intermediate is protonated during the work-up step (implicitly, using a proton source like water or weak acid) to give the final stable product.\n    *   The new substituent attached to C6 is a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the ester, so the compound is named as a derivative of **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The substituent at the 3-position of the propanoate chain is the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   We number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment (original C6) as C1'.\n        *   The methyl group from the original C6 is at C1'.\n        *   The oxo group (C=O) from the original C1 is at C2'.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups from the original C2 are at C3'.\n    *   Combining these, the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for A in options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Nitroalkane and Nucleophile Formation:**\n    *   The starting compound is **1-nitropropane** (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10) due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the resonance stabilization of the conjugate base (the nitronate anion).\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at the carbon atom bonded to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Final Product (B):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate, a carbanion alpha to the nitrile group, is protonated by the solvent (water) to yield the final product.\n    *   The bond is formed between C1 of 1-nitropropane and C3 of but-2-enenitrile.\n        Product structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂CN`\n\n     \n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**. We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The chain is `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   There is a **methyl group** at C3.\n    *   There is a **nitro group** at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options B and C.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n*   A) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = correct\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n\nThe correct option is B, as it correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
