    "This problem requires us to apply the principles of special relativity to calculate the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nIn special relativity, velocities do not simply add or subtract. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction), we can find their relative speed using the formula:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂ / c²))\n\nWhere:\n*   v₁ is the speed of the first astronaut = 0.6c\n*   v₂ is the speed of the second astronaut = 0.5c\n*   c is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass `m₀` moving at a relativistic speed `v` is given by:\n\nE = γm₀c²\n\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together to find the total energy of the system (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass m₁ = 2m\n*   Speed v₁ = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate γ₁:\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₁:\n    E₁ = γ₁m₁c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass m₂ = 3m\n*   Speed v₂ = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₂:\n    E₂ = γ₂m₂c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n*   E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc²\n*   E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\nTo confirm these results, let's execute a python script for precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv1_c = 0.6  # v1 in terms of c\nv2_c = 0.5  # v2 in terms of c\nm1_m = 2.0  # m1 in terms of m\nm2_m = 3.0  # m2 in terms of m\n\n# 1. Calculate relative speed\nv_rel_c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\nprint(f\"Relative speed in terms of c: {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\n\n# 2. Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma) for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma) for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\n\n# 4.

    "The problem is solved in two parts: calculating the relative speed of the two astronauts and calculating the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, we would simply subtract the speeds (0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c). However, at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction, the formula for their relative speed is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - v₁v₂/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c (speed of the first astronaut)\n*   v₂ = 0.5c (speed of the second astronaut)\n*   c is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**2. Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle with rest mass `m₀` moving at speed `v` is given by Einstein's relativistic energy formula:\n\nE = γm₀c²\n\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\n*   Mass m₁ = 2m\n*   Speed v₁ = 0.6c\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor, γ₁:\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₁:\n    E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\n*   Mass m₂ = 3m\n*   Speed v₂ = 0.5c\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor, γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Now, calculate the energy E₂:\n    E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n*   E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc² = 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\nThe calculated values are a relative speed of **0.14c** and a total energy of **5.96 mc²**, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
