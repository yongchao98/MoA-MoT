    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can be in one of two states: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n**2. The Energy Equation**\n\nThe energy of the system for a given state (S1, S2, S3) is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\n**3. The Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_{all states} e^(-βE)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\n**4. Enumerate States and Calculate Energies**\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible states, calculate the energy for each, and then group them by their energy levels to find the degeneracies. Let's calculate the value of X = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state. The energy will then be E = -J*X.\n\nThe 8 states can be categorized by the number of spins pointing up (+1):\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (+1, +1, +1)\n        X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        E = -J(3) = -3J\n    *   State 2: (-1, -1, -1)\n        X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n        E = -J(3) = -3J\n    These two states have the same energy, E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy (number of states with this energy) is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   States with one spin down and two spins up:\n        *   (+1, +1, -1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 -> E = -J(-1) = J\n        *   (+1, -1, +1): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 -> E = -J(-1) = J\n        *   (-1, +1, +1): X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 -> E = -J(-1) = J\n    *   States with one spin up and two spins down:\n        *   (+1, -1, -1): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 -> E = -J(-1) = J\n        *   (-1, +1, -1): X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 -> E = -J(-1) = J\n        *   (-1, -1, +1): X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 -> E = -J(-1) = J\n    All six of these states have the same energy, E₂ = J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\n**5. Assemble the Partition Function**\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by their degeneracies.\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3βJ) + 6 * e^(-βJ)\n\nTo match the format of the options, we write Jβ instead of βJ:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
