    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    `T_eq1 = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq2 = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\n    When we divide T_eq1 by T_eq2, the terms `T_eff`, `R_star`, and `(1 - A)^(1/4)` cancel out because they are the same for both planets.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Observations:** The problem does not provide the semi-major axes (`a1`, `a2`) directly. We need to derive them from the given radial velocity (RV) data.\n\n5.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) is used to find the star's maximum radial velocity (K) caused by the orbiting planet.\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n    From this, we can see that the radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the Doppler shift `Δλ`.\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n6.  **Connect K to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's radial velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). The detection by the transit method implies an inclination `i` close to 90°, so we can assume `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity, `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\n    Substituting `v_p`:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    `K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio a2 / a1:** Now we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out.\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n9.  **Substitute Known Ratios:** We already know `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`. Substituting this into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n10. **Plug in the Numerical Values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n    *   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n    `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n    `a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n    `a2 / a1 = 225 / 784`\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula from step 3.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n12. **Compute the Final Decimal Value:**\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio as a decimal number.\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n1.  **Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_eff` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n    We need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n    `T_eq1 = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq2 = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo. Therefore, `T_eff`, `R_star`, and `A` are the same for both planets and will cancel out in the ratio.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star))`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n    To find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity Data:**\n    The amplitude of the radial velocity (RV) variation (`K`) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit and assuming the inclination `i` is ~90 degrees (which is a good assumption for planets detected via the transit method), the formula is:\n    `K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n4.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a2 / a1`):**\n    Using the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n5.  **Relating RV Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):**\n    The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ_0 = v / c`, where `K` is the maximum radial velocity `v`.\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    This shows that the RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the Doppler shift `Δλ`.\n    Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n6.  **Substituting and Calculating:**\n    Now substitute the ratio of Doppler shifts into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n    The problem provides the following values:\n    *   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n    *   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n    *   `Δλ_1 = 0.03` Å\n    *   `Δλ_2 = 0.04` Å\n\n    Now plug these values into the equation:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2`\n    `a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)^2`\n    `a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n    `a2 / a1 = 225 / 784`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio:**\n    Now that we have the ratio `a2 / a1`, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n    This value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.30\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 0.98\n    D) ~ 1.05\n\n    The calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
