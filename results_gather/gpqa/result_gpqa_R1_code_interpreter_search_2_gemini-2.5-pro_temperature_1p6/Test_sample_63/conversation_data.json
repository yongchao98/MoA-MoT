    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental results to identify the decomposition products.**\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is heated and completely decomposes into a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃). The mass of the tube did not change, which means no CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂, NO₂) were present in the gas mixture. This implies that the original salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, such as oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Remaining gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the reagents used.\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the chemical composition of the gases.**\n    *   The products contain Hydrogen (from H₂O), Oxygen (from H₂O and the gas reacting in tube 3), and Nitrogen (since N₂ is the most common inert gas in such decompositions).\n    *   The salts A and B must be composed of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts, they likely consist of an ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and a nitrogen-containing oxyanion (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the reaction in Tube №3 and determine the initial gas mixture.**\n    There are two plausible scenarios for the reaction with hot copper:\n    *   **Scenario A:** The gas reacting is O₂. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The 0.80 g mass increase is from O₂. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol. The inert gas C would be N₂. So, the initial gas mixture was H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n    *   **Scenario B:** The gas reacting is N₂O. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. The 0.80 g mass increase is from the oxygen atom in N₂O. Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol, which means moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas. Gas C is the total N₂ collected at the end, which is 0.1 mol. This total N₂ is the sum of N₂ produced from N₂O and any N₂ that was originally in the gas mixture.\n        *   Total N₂ = N₂(from N₂O) + N₂(original)\n        *   0.1 mol = 0.05 mol + N₂(original) => Moles of original N₂ = 0.05 mol.\n        *   So, the initial gas mixture was H₂O, N₂O, and N₂.\n\n4.  **Identify salts A and B based on the decomposition products.**\n    Scenario B is more chemically accurate for the given temperature (200°C), as ammonium nitrate typically decomposes to N₂O and H₂O at this temperature, while ammonium nitrite decomposes to N₂ and H₂O.\n    Let's test this hypothesis. Assume:\n    *   Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    The decomposition reactions are:\n    *   A: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   B: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n    The problem states the mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let `n` be the number of moles of salt A and salt B.\n    *   From `n` moles of A (NH₄NO₃), we get `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   From `n` moles of B (NH₄NO₂), we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n    Total products from the mixture:\n    *   Total Moles of N₂O = `n`\n    *   Total Moles of N₂ = `n`\n    *   Total Moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\n    Now, we match this with the moles we calculated from the experimental data in step 3 (Scenario B):\n    *   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol  => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol   => `4n = 0.2` => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    All calculations yield a consistent value of `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our identification of the salts.\n\n5.  **Verify the total mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₃) = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₂) = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (moles of A × M_A) + (moles of B × M_B)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** The formula can be written as N₂H₄O₂.\n        *   Number of atoms = 2 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\nFinal Answer Check: All data points (masses, volumes) are consistent with the identified salts and their decomposition products. The calculation of the number of atoms is straightforward from the chemical formulas. The answer is 17, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nH_mass = 1.008\nN_mass = 14.007\nO_mass = 15.999\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80 # g, this is mass of Oxygen\nvol_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / (2 * H_mass + O_mass)\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / O_mass\nmoles_gas_C = vol_gas_C / 22.4 # Assuming N2\n\n# Scenario: Initial gases are H2O, N2O, N2\n# From tube 3, moles_N2O = moles_O_atoms\nmoles_N2O = moles_O_atoms\n# Gas C (N2) is from N2O decomposition and original N2\nmoles_N2_from_N2O = moles_N2O\nmoles_N2_original = moles_gas_C - moles_N2_from_N2O\n\n# Let n be the moles of each salt (NH4NO3 and NH4NO2)\n# From NH4NO3 -> N2O + 2H2O, moles N2O = n\n# From NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O, moles N2 = n\n# Total moles H2O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n# So, we can find n from any of the products\nn_from_N2O = moles_N2O\nn_from_N2 = moles_N2_original\nn_from_H2O = moles_H2O / 4\n\n# Salt Formulas and Atom Counts\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 (N2H4O3)\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 (N2H4O2)\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O: {moles_H2O:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles of N2O: {n_from_N2O:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles of original N2: {n_from_N2:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Value of n from H2O data: {n_from_H2O:.3f}\")\nprint(\"The calculated moles are consistent, around 0.05 mol.\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in NH4NO3 and NH4NO2 is: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
