    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactants:**\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as a Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction occurs between a conjugated diene and a dienophile, typically promoted by heat.\n    *   **Diene:** 2,5-dimethylthiophene. In this reaction, the thiophene ring acts as the 4π-electron system. The diene component consists of atoms C2, C3, C4, and C5 of the thiophene ring.\n    *   **Dienophile:** Furan-2,5-dione, which is the common name for Maleic Anhydride. This provides the 2π-electron system from its C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Determine the Product's Connectivity:**\n    *   In the Diels-Alder reaction, a new six-membered ring is formed.\n    *   New sigma bonds form between the ends of the diene system (C2 and C5 of thiophene) and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n    *   The original double bonds in the diene rearrange, forming a new double bond between the central carbons (C3 and C4 of thiophene).\n    *   The sulfur atom from the thiophene ring is not part of the reacting diene system but becomes a bridge connecting the former C2 and C5 carbons. This forms a bicyclic structure with an \"epithio\" bridge.\n    *   The maleic anhydride molecule becomes fused to the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The resulting molecular framework is named as a derivative of `isobenzofuran-1,3-dione` (the system formed by the anhydride) with a `4,7-epithio` bridge. The methyl groups from the diene are at positions C4 and C7. The hydrogenation is indicated by `3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro`.\n    *   The full base name is `4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-epithioisobenzofuran-1,3-dione`. This matches the chemical names in options A and C, and eliminates options B and D, which incorrectly describe the structure as an \"epoxybenzo[c]thiophene\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry (EXO Product):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two primary stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*. The term typically refers to the orientation of the substituents on the dienophile relative to the diene's bridge.\n    *   The question specifies the **EXO product**. In the context of a bridged bicyclic system, \"exo\" means the substituent (the anhydride ring, in this case) is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the main bridge (the sulfur bridge).\n    *   We also need to determine the orientation of the methyl groups from the diene. During the cycloaddition, the planar diene puckers. To minimize steric hindrance with the incoming dienophile and the resulting fused ring, the methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C4 and C7) will preferentially orient themselves on the same side as the sulfur bridge (*syn* to the bridge). This orientation is sometimes referred to as `endo` with respect to the bridge.\n    *   Therefore, the final EXO product has a specific relative stereochemistry: the anhydride ring is *anti* to the sulfur bridge, and the two methyl groups are *syn* to the sulfur bridge. This means the anhydride ring and the methyl groups are on opposite faces of the molecule (*trans* relationship).\n\n4.  **Assign the IUPAC Stereochemical Descriptors (R/S):**\n    *   The final step is to match this 3D arrangement to the correct set of R/S descriptors provided in the options. Assigning these from scratch is complex. A reliable method is to find a known, analogous structure.\n    *   The reaction of 2,5-dimethylfuran (oxygen analog of the diene) with maleimide derivatives (similar to the dienophile) is well-documented. The EXO adduct of this reaction has the same relative stereochemistry: the substituent from the dienophile is *anti* to the oxygen bridge, and the methyl groups are *syn* to the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The IUPAC name for one enantiomer of this analogous furan-derived product (e.g., with N-methylmaleimide) is (3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-...\n    *   The priority rules for assigning R/S configuration at the chiral centers (C3a, C4, C7, C7a) are determined by the atoms attached. Replacing the oxygen atom of the bridge with a sulfur atom does not change the order of priorities of the substituents at any of the chiral centers (S > C, O > C; S has higher priority than O, but both have higher priority than C).\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemical descriptors for the thiophene-derived product should be the same as for the furan-derived product with the same relative stereochemistry.\n    *   The set of descriptors is (3aR, 4S, 7R, 7aS).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The correct option must have the correct base name and the stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 4S, 7R, 7aS) corresponding to the specific enantiomer of the EXO product shown.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
