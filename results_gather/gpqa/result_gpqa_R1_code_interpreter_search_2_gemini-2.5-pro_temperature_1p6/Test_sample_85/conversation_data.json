    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products**\n\nBoth reactions produce an enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** This is a lactone (a cyclic ester). The \"pyran\" part indicates a 6-membered ring containing an oxygen atom. The \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group at position 2 (next to the ring oxygen). This is a δ-lactone.\n*   **Precursor:** 6-membered lactones (δ-lactones) are formed by the intramolecular esterification of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids (also called δ-hydroxycarboxylic acids).\n*   **Drawing the lactone and its precursor:**\n    *   The product is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's draw it and determine its open-chain precursor. The IUPAC numbering for the heterocycle starts with the ring oxygen as position 1 and the carbonyl carbon as position 2.\n    \n         \n        *Structure of (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and its precursor, (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.*\n    \n    *   To find the precursor, we break the ester bond (O1–C2). We add -H to the oxygen (O1) and -OH to the carbonyl carbon (C2).\n    *   This gives a linear molecule: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The cyclization reaction (lactonization) does not affect the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the lactone product is the same as the stereochemistry of its hydroxy acid precursor.\n    *   (R)-lactone comes from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   (S)-lactone comes from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   This compound is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid, **3-ethylpentanedioic acid**.\n*   It has two reducible functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu).\n*   Structure: **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu**.\n*   The chiral center is at C-3, which corresponds to the chiral center in the hydroxy acid precursor and the final lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and ketones but **does not** typically reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is unchanged.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + LiBH₄  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    2.  The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction pathway preserves the stereocenter, the starting material A must have the same configuration as the product. To produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group is unchanged during this step.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu  + BH₃  →  HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n        The intermediate is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) serves two purposes here. First, it catalyzes the **hydrolysis** of the isobutyl ester back to a carboxylic acid.\n        HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu + H₂O/H⁺ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH + iBu-OH\n    3.  The molecule formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**, the same type of intermediate as in Reaction A.\n    4.  The acidic conditions then promote the lactonization of this intermediate to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This pathway also preserves the stereocenter. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
