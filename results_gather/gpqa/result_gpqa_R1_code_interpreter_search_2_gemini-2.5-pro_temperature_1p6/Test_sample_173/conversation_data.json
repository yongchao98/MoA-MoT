    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of a fission fragment using both relativistic and classical physics, and then find the difference.\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Initial Conditions\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest mass: `M`\n*   Initial nucleus rest energy: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   Rest masses of the two fragments: `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Kinetic energies of the two fragments: `T1` and `T2`.\n*   The more massive fragment is `m1`.\n*   Given: `m1 = 2 * m2`\n*   Given: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe can work with rest energies directly, as `E_rest = m*c^2`.\nFrom the given relations:\n1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n2.  `(m1 + m2)*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find the rest energy of the more massive fragment, `m1`:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, we have:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `E_rest_1 = 198 GeV`\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `E_rest_2 = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the parent nucleus. The final energy is the sum of the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n`300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n`300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n\nThis gives us the total kinetic energy released, also known as the Q-value of the reaction:\n`T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. The fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n`p1 + p2 = 0` => `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\nWe can write `(pc)^2` in terms of kinetic energy `T`:\n`E = T + mc^2`\n`(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2) + (mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2`\n`(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)`\n\nSince the fragments have equal momentum magnitude `p`:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have the following values and relations:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron-volts (MeV). Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
