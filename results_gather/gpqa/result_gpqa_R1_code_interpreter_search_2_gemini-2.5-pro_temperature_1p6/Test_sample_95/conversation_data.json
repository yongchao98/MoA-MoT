Identify Necessary Physics Formulas:**\n*   **Small-angle approximation:** To relate the physical size (diameter D) of an object to its angular size ($\\theta$) and distance (d). The formula is $D \\approx d \\cdot \\theta$. The radius is $R = D/2$. For a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s$.\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Formula:** This formula relates the entropy (S) of a black hole to the area (A) of its event horizon.
