    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Modeling the Radiating Source**\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This oscillating charge will radiate electromagnetic waves. The radiation from any localized oscillating source can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The main contributions come from the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and so on.\n\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** This is the lowest order and usually the dominant form of radiation. It arises from a time-varying electric dipole moment. For a charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, there will be a non-zero oscillating electric dipole moment, `p_z(t)`.\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** This becomes the dominant term only if the electric dipole moment is zero for all time. This can happen in cases of specific symmetry, for example, a pulsating sphere or a spheroid oscillating between prolate and oblate shapes symmetrically.\n\nIn the absence of information suggesting that the electric dipole moment is zero, the standard and most reasonable assumption is that the radiation is dominated by the electric dipole term. The \"spheroid shape\" and \"z-axis symmetry\" serve to define the axis of the effective dipole.\n\n**2. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Dipole)**\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n*   The radiated power `f(λ, θ)` is this quantity `dP/dΩ`.\n*   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis).\n*   So, we can write the radiated power as `f(λ, θ) = C * sin²(θ)`, where `C` depends on other factors like wavelength and the source strength. The maximum power is `A = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n*   Therefore, the power at any angle can be expressed in terms of the maximum power `A`: `f(λ, θ) = A * sin²(θ)`.\n\nNow, we need to find the fraction of `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n\nFraction = `f(λ, 30°) / A = (A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`.\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**3. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power (Electric Dipole)**\n\nNow we need to determine the dependence of the radiated power `f` on the wavelength `λ`.\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating dipole is related to the square of the acceleration of the charges.\n*   Let the oscillation be described by a position `z(t) ∝ cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   The acceleration is the second time derivative: `a(t) = d²z/dt² ∝ -ω²cos(ωt)`.\n*   The radiated power is proportional to the time-average of the acceleration squared: `P ∝ <a(t)²> ∝ <(-ω²cos(ωt))²> ∝ ω⁴`.\n*   So, the radiated power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by:\n`ω = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c/λ)`\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n`f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\nSo, a possible form of the function `f` includes a **λ⁻⁴** dependence.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The functional form depends on wavelength as **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results match option A.\n\n(Note: If one were to assume the source is an electric quadrupole, the angular dependence would be `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and the wavelength dependence would be `λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of 3/4 and a `λ⁻⁶` dependence, corresponding to option D. However, as argued in step 1, the electric dipole is the most fundamental and expected source of radiation in this context.)\n\n<<<A>>>"
