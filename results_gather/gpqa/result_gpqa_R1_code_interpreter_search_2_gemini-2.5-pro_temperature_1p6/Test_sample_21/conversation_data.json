    "E1. **Analyze the first part of the statement: Thermodynamics**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine if oxygen is a \"stronger\" or \"weaker\" oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   **Concept:** The strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value corresponds to a stronger oxidant.\n*   **Reactions:** We need to compare the standard reduction potentials for the reduction of oxygen in acidic and basic media.\n    *   **Acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    *   **Basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Data Retrieval:** Standard electrochemical potential tables provide the following values:\n    *   E°(O₂/H₂O) in acidic solution is +1.23 V.\n    *   E°(O₂/OH⁻) in basic solution is +0.40 V.\n*   **Comparison:** Since +1.23 V > +0.40 V, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solution than in basic solution.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**2. Analyze the second part of the statement: Kinetics**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine if oxygen reacts \"faster\" or \"slower\" in acidic solutions.\n*   **Concept:** The rate of reaction is a matter of kinetics, not thermodynamics. The reduction of O₂ to H₂O is a four-electron transfer process. Such multi-electron transfers are often slow because they involve several intermediate steps and high activation energy barriers.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    *   In both acidic and basic solutions, the reduction of O₂ proceeds through intermediates like hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The overall reaction is O₂ → H₂O₂ → H₂O.\n    *   The first step, the reduction of O₂ to H₂O₂ (O₂(g) + 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → H₂O₂(aq), E° = +0.70 V), has a significantly lower reduction potential than the overall four-electron reduction (+1.23 V). This difference indicates that the initial reduction step is kinetically challenging, making the overall process slow. This is often referred to as the \"oxygen overpotential.\"\n*   **Comparing Acidic vs. Basic media:** While the reaction is slow in both environments, the presence of protons (H⁺) in acidic solutions can facilitate the bond-breaking and forming steps in the reaction mechanism. Protons can stabilize the peroxide intermediate and catalyze its further reduction. The kinetic barriers for the multi-electron transfer are generally lower in acidic media compared to basic media.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions than in basic solutions (though still relatively slowly overall).\n\n**3. Combine the conclusions**\n\n*   First blank: **weaker**\n*   Second blank: **faster**\n\nThe correct combination is weaker – faster.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
