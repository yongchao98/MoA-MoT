    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Particle Decay Law:**\n    The number of particles, N, remaining after a time t' in their own rest frame follows an exponential decay law:\n    N(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)\n    where:\n    *   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n    *   τ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (a constant for a given particle type).\n    *   t' is the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (the proper time).\n    The fraction of particles that survive is N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ).\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame Time to Proper Time (Time Dilation):**\n    The time measured in the laboratory frame (t), where the detector is at rest, is longer than the time experienced by the moving particle (t'). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    t = γ * t'\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor, defined as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is t' = t / γ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius R = 30 meters. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities (v ≈ c). The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    t = Distance / Velocity ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for t' and t into the decay equation:\n    *   First, find t':  t' = t / γ ≈ (R/c) / γ = R / (γc)\n    *   Then, find the survival fraction: N/N₀ = exp[-(R / (γc)) / τ] = exp[-R / (γcτ)]\n\n    The term `cτ` is the mean distance a particle would travel at the speed of light during its proper lifetime. This is a constant for the particle. Let's call the constant `K = R / (cτ)`.\n    So, the survival fraction `P = N/N₀` can be written as:\n    P = exp(-K / γ)\n\n5.  **Use the Given Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor:**\n\n    **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Survival fraction, P₁ = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n    Plugging these values into our formula:\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Survival fraction, P₂ = 2/3\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂\n    ln(3/2) = K / γ₂\n    So, γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for K from Scenario 1 into the equation for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = [20 * ln(3)] / ln(3/2)\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b):\n    γ₂ = [20 * ln(3)] / [ln(3) - ln(2)]\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The relationship derived from the physics is:\n# gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n```output\n54.18553556064426\n```\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. This is very close to 54.\n\nFinal Answer Check: A higher Lorentz factor means time is more dilated for the particles (they experience less time passing). Therefore, fewer particles should decay, and a higher fraction should reach the detector. Since the fraction increases from 1/3 to 2/3, the Lorentz factor must increase from 20, which is consistent with our result (54 > 20).\n\nAmong the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 40\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value of ~54 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires us to relate the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor, which is a measure of how relativistic they are. The core concepts are the exponential decay law and relativistic time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction of particles, `P`, that survive after a time `t'` has passed in their own rest frame (proper time) is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `P = N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle, a constant characteristic of the particle type.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (where the detector is at rest), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time `t` measured in the lab frame is related to the proper time `t'` by the time dilation formula:\n    `t' = t / γ`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    `t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** We can substitute the expressions for `t` and `t'` into the decay law to get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    *   First, find the proper time `t'` the particle experiences during its flight: `t' = t / γ ≈ (R / c) / γ = R / (γc)`\n    *   Now, plug this `t'` into the decay equation: `P(γ) = exp[-(R / (γc)) / τ] = exp[-R / (γcτ)]`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Unknowns:** The expression `R / (cτ)` is a constant value for this specific experimental setup and particle type. Let's call this constant `K`. So, the survival fraction is:\n    `P(γ) = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    We are given two scenarios which we can use to solve for the required Lorentz factor.\n\n    **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Survival fraction, `P₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n\n    Plugging these values in:\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Survival fraction, `P₂ = 2/3`\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\n    Plugging these values into the same formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\n    Now we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `K` that we found from Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the numerical values for the logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.
