As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental data to determine the genetic interactions.\n\n**1. Analyze the single-mutant phenotypes:**\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% decrease in resistance. This means G1 contributes to the resistance pathway, but it's not the most critical component on its own.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% decrease. G3 is a more significant contributor to resistance than G1.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function leads to a complete loss of resistance. This strongly suggests that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the double-mutant phenotypes to understand epistasis and other interactions:**\n*   **Epistasis:** This occurs when the mutation in one gene masks the effect of a mutation in another. The phenotype of the double mutant will be the same as the phenotype of the epistatic (masking) single mutant.\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0%). The `g1` mutation (which would result in 75% resistance) has no effect in the absence of G2. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0%). The `g3` mutation (which would result in 50% resistance) has no effect in the absence of G2. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   **Conclusion from epistasis:** When one gene (G2) is epistatic to others (G1, G3), it usually means it acts downstream in a linear pathway (e.g., G1/G3 -> G2 -> Resistance) or that its function is absolutely required for the final output, overriding any contribution from the other genes.\n\n*   **Gene Redundancy/Synergy:** This occurs when two genes perform similar or overlapping functions. The double mutant exhibits a phenotype that is much more severe than the additive effects of the single mutants.\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance.\n    *   Loss from g1 alone = 25%. Loss from g3 alone = 50%.\n    *   Expected additive loss = 25% + 50% = 75%, which would leave 25% resistance.\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected 25%. This synergistic effect is a classic indicator of **gene redundancy**. G1 and G3 have overlapping functions, and the pathway is much more severely affected when both are knocked out.\n\n**3. Identify the Transcription Factor (TF):**\n*   The problem states \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\".\n*   A key test for an upstream TF regulating downstream targets is to compare the phenotype of the TF mutant with the phenotype of the double (or multiple) mutant of its targets. If G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3 (Pathway: G2 -> [G1, G3] -> Resistance), then knocking out G2 should produce the same (or very similar) result as knocking out both G1 and G3.\n    *   `g2` phenotype = 0% resistance.\n    *   `g1g3` phenotype = 10% resistance.\n*   These two phenotypes are almost identical (a complete or near-complete loss of resistance). This provides very strong evidence that **G2 is the transcription factor that acts upstream to activate G1 and G3**. The minor 10% residual resistance in the `g1g3` mutant could be due to a minor, independent function of G2 or some low-level basal expression of other resistance genes.\n\n**4. Synthesize the findings and evaluate the options:**\nOur model of the pathway is:\n*   G2 is an upstream transcription factor.\n*   G2 activates G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 are functionally redundant and act downstream of G2 to confer resistance.\n*   The essential nature of G2 makes it epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n\nNow let's check the given options against our conclusions:\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   G2 is a TF: Correct.\n    *   G1/G3 same promoter: Plausible, but a hypothesis, not a direct conclusion.\n    *   G3 epistatic to G1: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n    *   G1 is a TF: Incorrect. The evidence points to G2.\n    *   G2 is epistatic to G1: Correct, but the main premise of the option is wrong.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   G2 is a TF: Correct.\n    *   Pleiotropy: Cannot be determined from the given data.\n    *   G1 epistatic to G3: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n    *   **G2 is a transcription factor:** Correct, as supported by the `g2` vs. `g1g3` phenotypes.\n    *   **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** Correct, as supported by the synergistic interaction in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n    *   **G1 is epistatic towards G3:** Incorrect. As with option C, this statement is not supported by the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption D contains two correct statements that are strongly supported by direct analysis of the experimental data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). While its third statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, it is the option that most accurately describes the genetic relationships that can be concluded from the experiment. The incorrect clause is likely a flaw in the question's options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
