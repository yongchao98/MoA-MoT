    "The user wants to identify the mutation most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a gene. Eliminating the compound requires inactivating the protein encoded by the gene. The most effective way to inactivate a protein is through a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation (shifting the reading frame and scrambling the amino acid sequence).\n\nHere is the breakdown and analysis of each mutant:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    The provided sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon (Methionine), and ends with `TGA`, a stop codon. Let's break the initial part of the intact sequence into codons (triplets of nucleotides):\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ... -3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val ...\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutant Sequences:**\n    We need to compare each mutant to the intact sequence to determine the type of mutation and its likely effect.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Intact:   `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n        *   Mutant 1: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...` (based on the sequence `ATGTTCTACGCT...`)\n        *   **Changes:** The second codon, `TTT`, is changed to `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a *silent mutation*. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid.\n        *   **Effect:** A single amino acid change may or may not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to cause complete loss of function compared to more severe mutations.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Intact:   `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n        *   Mutant 2: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...` (based on the sequence `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`)\n        *   **Changes:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Effect:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to terminate prematurely at the third codon. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). Such a drastically shortened protein is virtually certain to be non-functional. This is a very effective way to eliminate the gene's product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Intact:   `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...`\n        *   **Changes:** Comparing the sequences reveals two separate point mutations. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   **Effect:** These are two distinct **missense mutations**. While changing two amino acids increases the chance of disrupting protein function compared to changing just one, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Intact:   `5’-...GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `5’-...GCT --- ACT...` (based on the sequence `...GCTACT...`)\n        *   **Change:** The codon `GGT`, which codes for Glycine, has been deleted from the sequence.\n        *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes a single amino acid but leaves the rest of the downstream reading frame intact. The resulting protein will be one amino acid shorter. This might disrupt the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed. The impact is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the potential impacts of the four mutations:\n*   **Mutant 1 (Missense):** Low probability of complete inactivation.\n*   **Mutant 2 (Nonsense):** Extremely high probability of complete inactivation due to a premature stop codon early in the sequence.\n*   **Mutant 3 (Two Missense):** Moderate probability of inactivation.\n*   **Mutant 4 (In-frame Deletion):** Moderate probability of inactivation.\n\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and therefore the most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
