    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], from a solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as [CaY]^2-, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and the EDTA ligand, Y^4-. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    [CaY]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which we'll call K_f.\n    K_f = [[CaY]^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5 x 10^10\n    The question states that the pH is \"ideal\". This is a simplification meaning we can consider the EDTA to be fully deprotonated as Y^4- and don't need to worry about conditional formation constants (K'f) which are pH-dependent.\n\n3.  **Set up an equilibrium problem (ICE table):** We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, [CaY]^2-. We want to find how much of it dissociates. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ that forms at equilibrium.\n    *   **Initial:** [[CaY]^2-] = 0.02 M, [Ca^2+] = 0 M, [Y^4-] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:** As the complex dissociates, [[CaY]^2-] decreases by 'x', while [Ca^2+] and [Y^4-] each increase by 'x'.\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   [[CaY]^2-] = 0.02 - x\n        *   [Ca^2+] = x\n        *   [Y^4-] = x\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Because the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10 >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the left (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    5 x 10^10 = 0.02 / x^2\n\n    Rearrange to solve for x^2:\n    x^2 = 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n\n    Now we can perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nKf = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / Kf\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / Kf\n\n# x = sqrt(x^2)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is equal to 'x'.\n\n[Ca^2+] = 6.32 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]^2- (where Y^4- is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand), is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n2.  **Use the given formation constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant, K_f, for the complex. The expression for K_f is:\n    K_f = [[CaY]^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-])\n    We are given K_f = 5 x 10^10. The problem states that the pH is \"ideal,\" which is a simplification meaning we can consider the EDTA to be fully deprotonated as Y^4- and we do not need to account for pH effects on the EDTA species (i.e., we don't need a conditional formation constant, K'_f).\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates to some extent. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that form at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**         [CaY]^2-    ⇌    Ca^2+   +   Y^4-\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M          0 M        0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x              +x         +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**   0.02 - x         x          x\n\n4.  **Substitute into the equilibrium expression:** Now we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10^10), which indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, favoring the formation of the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation significantly:\n    5 x 10^10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n\n6.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca^2+].\n    x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10^10)\n    x^2 ≈ 4 x 10^-13\n    x = √(4 x 10^-13)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.
