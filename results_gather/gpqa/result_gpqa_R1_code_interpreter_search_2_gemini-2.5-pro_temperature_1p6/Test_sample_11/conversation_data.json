    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\nThe nuclear decay process is given by:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nwhere:\n*   Pi(+) is the positive pion.\n*   mu(+) is the positive muon (an antimuon).\n*   nu is a muon neutrino.\n\nThe problem states that the pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c^2\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c^2\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (nu) is considered to be zero (m_nu = 0 MeV/c^2), which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\nWe will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve this problem. For simplicity, we can work with energies in MeV and momenta in MeV/c. The speed of light `c` will be implicitly handled by the units.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its kinetic energy is zero. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu).\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n\n    Equating initial and final energies:\n    E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV  ---(1)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (p_mu) and the neutrino (p_nu).\n    p_final = p_mu + p_nu\n\n    Equating initial and final momenta:\n    p_mu + p_nu = 0\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as `p`.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):**\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (105.7)^2  ---(2)\n\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** Since we assume its rest mass is zero (m_nu = 0):\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0)^2\n    E_nu = p*c  ---(3)\n\n**4. Solving the Equations**\nNow we solve the system of equations.\nSubstitute E_nu from equation (3) into equation (2):\nE_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (105.7)^2\nE_mu^2 - E_nu^2 = (105.7)^2\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula (a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)):\n(E_mu - E_nu)(E_mu + E_nu) = (105.7)^2\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation (1), we know (E_mu + E_nu) = 139.6. Substitute this value:\n(E_mu - E_nu) * 139.6 = (105.7)^2\nE_mu - E_nu = (105.7)^2 / 139.6\nE_mu - E_nu = 11172.49 / 139.6\nE_mu - E_nu ≈ 80.032 MeV  ---(4)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n(1) E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV\n(4) E_mu - E_nu = 80.032 MeV\n\nAdd equations (1) and (4) to solve for E_mu:\n2 * E_mu = 139.6 + 80.032\n2 * E_mu = 219.632\nE_mu = 109.816 MeV\n\nSubtract equation (4) from equation (1) to solve for E_nu:\n2 * E_nu = 139.6 - 80.032\n2 * E_nu = 59.568\nE_nu = 29.784 MeV\n\n**5. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nThe kinetic energy of a particle is the difference between its total energy and its rest mass energy (KE = E - m*c^2).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu):**\n    KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2\n    KE_mu = 109.816 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE_mu = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    Since the rest mass of the neutrino is assumed to be zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu * c^2\n    KE_nu = 29.784 MeV - 0 MeV\n    KE_nu = 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's execute a simple script.\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV/c^2\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\nm_nu = 0\n\n# From conservation of energy: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi\n# From conservation of momentum and energy-momentum relation:\n# E_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\n# E_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\nE_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Calculate total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi**2 + m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Kinetic energy (KE) = Total Energy (E) - Rest Mass Energy (mc^2)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\nKE_nu = E_nu - m_nu  # Since m_nu is 0, KE_nu = E_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n>>>KE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\nThe code confirms the manually calculated values.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle into two other particles. We can solve it using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define the System**\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (Pi+).\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu) moving in opposite directions.\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Rest mass energy of Pi+,  m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of mu+, m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of neutrino, m_nu * c^2 ≈ 0 MeV (a standard approximation)\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Energy Before (E_initial):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Energy After (E_final):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_mu) and the neutrino (E_nu). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (E = mc^2 + KE).\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n\n*   **Equating Energies:**\n    E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV  ---(Equation 1)\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Momentum Before (p_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    p_initial = 0\n\n*   **Momentum After (p_final):** The momentum after is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (p_mu) and the neutrino (p_nu). For the total momentum to remain zero, they must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    p_mu + p_nu = 0  =>  |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Use the Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** Since its rest mass is zero, its equation simplifies to:\n    E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + 0^2  =>  E_nu = p*c\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):**\n    E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    Since p*c = E_nu, we can substitute this into the muon's equation:\n    E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies**\nRearrange the equation from the previous step:\nE_mu^2 - E_nu^2 = (m_mu*c^2)^2\n(E_mu - E_nu)(E_mu + E_nu) = (105.7 MeV)^2\n\nFrom the conservation of energy (Equation 1), we know (E_mu + E_nu) = 139.6 MeV. Substitute this value:\n(E_mu - E_nu) * (139.6 MeV) = (105.7 MeV)^2\nE_mu - E_nu = 11172.49 / 139.6 MeV\nE_mu - E_nu ≈ 80.03 MeV  ---(Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV\n2.  E_mu - E_nu = 80.03 MeV\n\nAdd the two equations to solve for E_mu:\n2 * E_mu = 219.63 MeV\nE_mu = 109.815 MeV\n\nSubstitute E_mu back into Equation 1 to find E_nu:\n109.815 MeV + E_nu = 139.6 MeV\nE_nu = 139.6 - 109.815 MeV\nE_nu = 29.785 MeV\n\n**6. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - m*c^2).\n\n*   **KE of muon (KE_mu):**\n    KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = 109.815 MeV - 105.7 MeV = **4.115 MeV**\n\n*   **KE of neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu*c^2 = 29.785 MeV - 0 MeV = **29.785 MeV**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV and KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV. These values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
