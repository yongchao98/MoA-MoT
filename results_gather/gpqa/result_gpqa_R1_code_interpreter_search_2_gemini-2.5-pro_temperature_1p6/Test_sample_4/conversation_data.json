    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector `n`:**\n    The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$, which represents the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis. The Cartesian components of this unit vector are:\n    $n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n    $n_y = 0$\n    $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator `P_n` along the direction `n`:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$:\n    $P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operators $P_x, P_y, P_z$:\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    $P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z)$\n\n4.  **Write the matrix representation of `P_n`:**\n    Now, substitute the matrix forms of $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n \\chi = \\lambda \\chi$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the eigenvector components:**\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    (i) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    (ii) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $b = a\\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form $\\chi' = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    To simplify and normalize, we can choose a convenient value for the constant $a$. Let $a = k \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some normalization constant $k$. Then $b = k \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = k \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    The eigenvector is $\\chi = k \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The normalization condition requires that the inner product $\\chi^\\dagger \\chi = 1$:\n    $|k|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^*, (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = 1$\n    Since $\\theta$ is a real angle, the components are real.\n    $|k|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    $|k|^2 (1) = 1$, which implies $|k|=1$.\n    We can choose the simplest phase, $k=1$.\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $\\chi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\n8.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
