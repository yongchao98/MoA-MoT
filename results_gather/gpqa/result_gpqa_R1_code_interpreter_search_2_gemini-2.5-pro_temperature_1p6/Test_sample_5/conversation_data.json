    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:** The given potential is in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n    $V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often helpful to work in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ if the potential simplifies.\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** We use the standard conversion formulas:\n    $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n    $y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n    $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, we have:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:** Combine the terms:\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n4.  **Separate the Hamiltonian:** The potential is now a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on $x$ and the other only on $y$:\n    $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\n    where $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$ and $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$.\n    This means the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation is separable. The total energy $E$ will be the sum of the energies for the one-dimensional motion in $x$ and $y$, i.e., $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\n5.  **Solve the 1D Schrödinger Equation for the x-direction:** The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$. This is the potential for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, which has the general form $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{eff}x^2$.\n    Comparing the two forms, we find the effective spring constant for the x-motion:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} k_{eff,x} = 2k \\implies k_{eff,x} = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency of the x-oscillator is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,x}}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy levels for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n6.  **Solve the 1D Schrödinger Equation for the y-direction:** The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$. This is the standard form for a harmonic oscillator with an effective spring constant $k_{eff,y} = k$.\n    The angular frequency of the y-oscillator is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,y}}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$, where $n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:** The total energy is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    Let's factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n    $E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    $E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)\\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
