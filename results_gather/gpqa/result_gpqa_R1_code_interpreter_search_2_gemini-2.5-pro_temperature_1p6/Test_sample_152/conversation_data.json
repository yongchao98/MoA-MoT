These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-hydrogen located between the two carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `[:CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for the Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, and subsequently, the π-electrons of the carbonyl group move to the oxygen atom, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   This intermediate is then protonated at the α-carbon by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product (A):**\n    *   The product is a derivative with three methyl ester (tricarboxylate) groups. Let's analyze the name given in the options.\n    *   **\"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\"**: This name implies a propane (3-carbon) backbone. Let's number this hypothetical chain C1-C2-C3.\n        *   Two carboxylate groups are at C1: `C1H(COOCH₃)₂`.\n        *   One p-tolyl group is at C2: `-C2H(p-tolyl)-`.\n        *   One carboxylate group is at C3: `-C3H₂(COOCH₃)`.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the one derived from our mechanistic analysis. Therefore, this is the correct name for product A among the choices. The alternative name, \"trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate\", would correspond to an entirely different structure, `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(COOCH₃)-CH₂(p-tolyl)`, which cannot be formed from the given reactants.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation followed by Hydrolysis):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate on the cyclohexane ring and a carbanion on the nitrile part, which is then protonated.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The net result is the addition of a substituent to the α-carbon (C2) of the original cyclohexanone.\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile fragment: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: `2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (CN). We number the carbon chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   Chain: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(Subst.)-C(4)H₃`. The parent chain is a butanenitrile.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring, attached via its C2 position. This group is called `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The substituent is on C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   The alternative name involving \"hydroxy\" corresponds to the enol tautomer, which is not the major product under these acidic workup conditions.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the Michael donor, reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic α-carbon of the donor and the electrophilic β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from MVK in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃`, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n    *   This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   By removing the `3-oxobutyl` group from C2 of the product and replacing it with a hydrogen atom, we get the structure of the starting Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   Product - (Fragment from MVK) = Reactant C\n    *   [2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione] - [-CH₂CH₂COCH₃] → `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The protons at C2 of this β-dicarbonyl compound are very acidic (pKa ≈ 5) and are readily removed by KOH to form the required nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option C matches all three conclusions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
