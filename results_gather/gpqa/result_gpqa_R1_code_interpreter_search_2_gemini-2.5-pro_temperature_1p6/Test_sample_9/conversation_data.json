    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n**1. Understand Density**\n\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\n**2. Analyze the Concept of Gravitational Compression**\n\nA crucial concept for this problem is gravitational compression. When a planet forms, its own gravity pulls all its material inward. The more massive a planet is, the stronger its gravity, and the more it compresses its internal material. Therefore, for two planets made of the *same materials* (same composition), the more massive one will be squeezed into a proportionally smaller volume, resulting in a higher overall density. The density of the uncompressed material is lower than the planet's final, compressed density.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's use this as our baseline.\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   The density is given directly.\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   This is very similar to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   This planet is made of the same iron/silicate mix as Earth but is much more massive.\n    *   Due to the significantly stronger gravity of this 5 Earth-mass planet, its materials will be compressed much more than Earth's.\n    *   This increased compression means it will be denser than Earth.\n    *   Therefore, Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This planet is also made of the same material as Earth but is less massive.\n    *   Its gravity will be weaker than Earth's, leading to less gravitational compression.\n    *   Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**4. Compare the Densities**\n\nLet's order the densities based on our analysis:\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nThe ordering is clearly: **(c) > (a) > (b) > (d)**.\n\nThe planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth (c) will have the highest density due to greater gravitational compression.\n\nTo confirm with a calculation, a common approximation for the mass-radius relationship of rocky planets is R ∝ M^0.27. Density (ρ) is M/V, which means ρ ∝ M/R³ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ ∝ M^0.19.\n\nUsing this relationship:\n*   Density (c) / Density (Earth) = (5 M_Earth / M_Earth)^0.19 = 5^0.19 ≈ 1.34. So, Density (c) is about 34% higher than Earth's.\n*   Density (d) / Density (Earth) = (0.5 M_Earth / M_Earth)^0.19 = 0.5^0.19 ≈ 0.88. So, Density (d) is about 12% lower than Earth's.\n\nThis confirms our reasoning.\n\n<<<A>>>"
