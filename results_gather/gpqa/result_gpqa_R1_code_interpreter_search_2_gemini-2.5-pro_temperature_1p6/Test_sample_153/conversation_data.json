    "**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. The relative intensity of this peak is 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** The intensity ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes have a natural abundance ratio of roughly 3:1).\n*   **Molecular Formula Check:** Let's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (which is the formula for all the options).\n    *   Mass with ³⁵Cl = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu.\n    *   Mass with ³⁷Cl = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 amu.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The mass spectrometry data strongly suggests the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options are consistent with this.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, a carbonyl conjugated to an aromatic ring in a carboxylic acid appears around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate option A (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde and a phenol). We are left with options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a singlet (s) for one proton (1H) at a very downfield chemical shift. This is the classic chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** We have two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet (d) corresponding to two protons (2H).\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet (d) corresponding to two protons (2H).\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Splitting:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   In a *para*-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons due to symmetry. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.\n    *   The protons at positions 2/6 split the adjacent protons at 3/5 into a doublet, and vice versa.\n*   **Evaluating Remaining Options:**\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It has four chemically non-equivalent protons in the aromatic region, which would lead to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted ring. It has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets for its four aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm) than the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** Confirms molecular weight of 156 and presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
