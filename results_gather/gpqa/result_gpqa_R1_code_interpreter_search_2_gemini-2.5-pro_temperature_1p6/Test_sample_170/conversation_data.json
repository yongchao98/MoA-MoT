    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\n\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-) as either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. This classification determines whether the para-isomer is a major or minor product.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (Methyl):** Activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (Ethyl):** Activating, o,p-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating, but o,p-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer is a minor product.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl ester):** Deactivating, m-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, m-directing.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while substances with ortho/para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 2: Order the substances with meta-directing groups.**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer yield is very low. The order among them depends on their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group makes the substitution more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n    *   **-NO2** is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   **-COOH** is a strong deactivating group.\n    *   **-COOC2H5** is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the lone pairs on the ether oxygen can donate some electron density towards the carbonyl group, and the ethyl group has a weak +I effect, both of which slightly reduce the overall electron-withdrawing effect from the benzene ring.\n\n*   Since a stronger deactivator gives less para-product, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength: **-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5**.\n\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances with ortho/para-directing groups.**\n\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are major products. The question asks for the weight fraction of the yield, which is equivalent to the mole fraction of the para-isomer in the product mixture (since all isomers have the same molar mass). We need to determine the para/ortho ratio. This ratio is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more, favoring the formation of the para-isomer. The steric bulk of these groups increases in the order: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   **Electronic Effects:**\n    *   For alkyl groups (**-CH3**, **-C2H5**), activating effects (hyperconjugation, +I) are slightly stronger at the ortho positions, but this is usually outweighed by steric hindrance. Comparing the two, **-C2H5** is bulkier than **-CH3**, so it will give a higher para/ortho ratio. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1). Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   For the **-Cl** group, the situation is different. While it is less bulky, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution. In electrophilic bromination, this effect is very pronounced, leading to a very high percentage of the para-isomer, often higher than for alkylbenzenes.\n\n*   Combining these points, the typical para-isomer yield for bromination increases in the order: **-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**.\n\n*   This corresponds to the order of substances: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups to get the final order.**\n\nWe combine the ordered list of meta-directors with the ordered list of ortho/para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors (lowest para-yield): **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho/para-directors (highest para-yield): **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
