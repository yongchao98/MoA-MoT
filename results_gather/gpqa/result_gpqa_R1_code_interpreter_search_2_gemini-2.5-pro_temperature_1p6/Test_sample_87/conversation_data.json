    "The user is asking to identify the immunological process responsible for high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches after exposure to an antigen.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins.\n    *   **Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cells:** A proliferating cell population is isolated. In response to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, proliferating cells are often lymphocytes (B cells or T cells) undergoing clonal expansion.\n    *   **Molecular observation:** Sequencing of the *variable heavy chain gene* reveals *high variability*. The heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor and antibodies.\n\n2.  **Analyze the options in the context of B cell biology:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a humoral part of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This is a genetic process that occurs in activated B cells. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This process does *not* alter the variable region, so it doesn't account for the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain.\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that assembles the variable region genes of B cell receptors and T cell receptors *during* the initial development of lymphocytes in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells). While it creates the initial diversity, it happens *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure, in a population of already selected and proliferating cells.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the DNA encoding the *variable regions* of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate further (a process called affinity maturation). This mechanism is directly responsible for the \"high variability\" observed in the variable region of a B cell population responding to an antigen.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The scenario describes an active immune response in a germinal center within a Peyer's patch. The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation, which serves to fine-tune and increase antibody affinity for the specific antigen.\n\n<<<D>>>"
