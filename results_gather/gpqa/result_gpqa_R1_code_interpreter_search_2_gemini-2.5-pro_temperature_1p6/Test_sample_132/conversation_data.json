    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   We are given KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely into K+ (a spectator ion) and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion). H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely into 2Na+ (spectator ions), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water. HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   Since we have a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), this solution is a buffer.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal.**\n    *   The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n    *   The PO4^3- ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:\n        HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    *   This equilibrium is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka3.\n\n3.  **Formulate a plan.**\n    *   **Step A:** Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, [H2PO4-] and [HPO4^2-].\n    *   **Step B:** Use the buffer equilibrium (related to Ka2) to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+], in the solution. The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.\n    *   **Step C:** Use the [H+] calculated in Step B and the third dissociation equilibrium (related to Ka3) to find the concentration of [PO4^3-].\n\n4.  **Execute the plan (Calculations).**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate initial concentrations.**\n        *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2000 L\n        *   Mass of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g (Molar Mass = 136.09 g/mol)\n        *   Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g (Molar Mass = 177.99 g/mol)\n\n        *   Moles of H2PO4- = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n        *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n        *   Moles of HPO4^2- = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n        *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n        *   The buffer equilibrium is: H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n        *   The acid dissociation constant expression for this is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n        *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n        *   Given: Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n        *   [H+] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        *   [H+] = 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n        *   The relevant equilibrium is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n        *   The acid dissociation constant expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n        *   We rearrange this to solve for the unknown, [PO4^3-]:\n        *   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n        *   Given: Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n        *   At equilibrium, the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is very small, meaning very little dissociates.\n        *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        *   [PO4^3-] = 6.234 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   Our calculated value is 6.234 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n    *   The options are:\n        A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n        B) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n        C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n        D) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   The calculated value is closest to option C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
