    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial data to identify Element Y.**\n    *   The problem states there are five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. This points towards a transition metal or an actinide with multiple stable oxidation states. Elements like Cr, U, Re, Os are good candidates.\n    *   A bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (F2). This means A1 is unstable at room temperature and is a higher fluoride than A2. The decomposition reaction is of the form: `A1 -> A2 + F2` (or stoichiometrically `2A1 -> 2A2 + F2`, etc.).\n    *   A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing xenon under normal conditions. This points to a high-valent fluoride.\n    *   A crucial piece of data is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2: ɷF = 31.96%. The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine in a compound YFx is `ɷF = (x * M_F) / (M_Y + x * M_F)`. We can rearrange this to find the atomic mass of Y (M_Y) based on its oxidation state (x): `M_Y = (x * M_F * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF`.\n    Using M_F ≈ 19 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196:\n    `M_Y ≈ (x * 19 * 0.6804) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 * x`.\n\n2.  **Test potential candidates for Y.**\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer x (oxidation state) that satisfy `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * x` and the chemical properties described.\n    *   **Hypothesis: Actinides (Pu, Np, U).** The property of being a colored, highly oxidizing fluoride that decomposes and reacts with xenon is very characteristic of actinide hexafluorides (like PuF6 or NpF6). For x=6, `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 6 = 242.7 g/mol`. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, M≈244) or Americium (Am, M≈243).\n        *   Let's check PuF6 for A2. ɷF(PuF6) ≈ 31.84%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n        *   However, if A2 = PuF6, then A1 must be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF7), which is not a known stable compound. Also, the description of A1 (bright-red, decomposes at 293 K) perfectly matches PuF6 itself, which decomposes to PuF4 and F2. This creates a contradiction: A1 seems to be PuF6, but then A2 should be PuF4, and the mass percentage for PuF4 (≈24%) does not match the given value for A2 at all. This path suggests there is a flaw in the problem statement. Furthermore, if we assume Y=Pu, none of the possible molecular weights for its fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6) fall into the given answer ranges.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis: Antimony (Sb).** For x=3, `M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol`. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76).\n        *   Let's check SbF3 for A2. ɷF(SbF3) ≈ 31.88%, which is an excellent match.\n        *   However, Sb only forms two stable binary fluorides (SbF3, SbF5), not five. Also, if A2=SbF3, then A1 must be a higher fluoride like SbF5. But SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and it is stable, it does not decompose at 293 K. This hypothesis fails on the chemical properties.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis: Chromium (Cr).** This is another strong possibility.\n        *   **Chemical Properties:** Chromium fits the \"five binary compounds\" rule (CrF2, CrF3, CrF4, CrF5, CrF6 are all known). Let's test the decomposition. CrF5 is a red, volatile solid that decomposes upon heating. The reaction `CrF5 -> CrF4 + 1/2 F2` fits the description `A1 -> A2 + F2`. This makes A1=CrF5 and A2=CrF4. CrF5 is a powerful oxidizer and would react with xenon. So, the chemical descriptions fit Y=Cr very well.\n        *   **Mass Percentage:** If A2 = CrF4, let's check its mass percentage. `M(Cr) ≈ 52 g/mol`. ɷF(CrF4) = (4 * 19) / (52 + 4 * 19) = 76 / 128 = 59.4%. This does not match the given 31.96%.\n        *   This creates a major conflict. The chemical properties point strongly to Y=Cr, but the numerical data does not match. In such cases, it is common in complex problems that the textual chemical description is the intended key and the number is a typo. Let's proceed with the chromium hypothesis, assuming the mass percentage is an error.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and its molecular weight.**\n    *   Let's assume Y=Cr is correct. We have A1=CrF5 and A2=CrF4.\n    *   The next clue is: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This describes the reaction: `Y + A4 -> A5` with a `Cr : A4` ratio of 1:1.\n    *   This is a classic comproportionation reaction, where an element in oxidation state 0 reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state to form a product in an intermediate oxidation state. A 1:1 reaction of the form `Y(0) + Y(IV) -> 2Y(II)` is stoichiometrically balanced.\n    *   Let's test this with chromium fluorides: `Cr + CrF4 -> 2CrF2`. This is a balanced reaction and fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants.\n    *   This implies that A4 = CrF4 and A5 = CrF2.\n    *   The problem has some remaining inconsistencies (e.g., a \"colorless\" chromium solution is unlikely), but this path provides a chemically plausible reaction sequence and identifies A4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    *   Based on our deduction, A4 is Chromium tetrafluoride (CrF4).\n    *   Atomic mass of Cr ≈ 52.0 g/mol.\n    *   Atomic mass of F ≈ 19.0 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of CrF4 = M(Cr) + 4 * M(F) = 52.0 + 4 * 19.0 = 52.0 + 76.0 = 128.0 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the result with the given ranges.**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 128.0 g/mol.\n    *   This value falls within the range B) 110-130.\n\n<<<B>>>"
