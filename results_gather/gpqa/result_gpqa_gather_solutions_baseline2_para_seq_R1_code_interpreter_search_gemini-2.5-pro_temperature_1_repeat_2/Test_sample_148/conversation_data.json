The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.

This means the two peaks represent the same proton in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   Two separate peaks are observed in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   The intensities of these two LC peaks are equal. This indicates the two species are present in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Both LC peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the target molecule. This proves that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass) of the expected compound.\n        *   The observation of two peaks at an *elevated temperature* is a key clue. It suggests the two species are stable and do not interconvert rapidly upon heating. If they were, for example, rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers), heating would cause their signals to merge (coalesce) into a single peak.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations (the options provided):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but any side reaction that involves adding an extra molecule or fragment (like a \"double\" coupling) would result in a product with a different mass. Again, the MS data contradicts this. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. They would give only *one* peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC rules out enantiomers. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This can happen in peptide synthesis if one of the amino acid starting materials was a racemic mixture (a mix of L and D forms) or if epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) occurred at one of the alpha-carbons during the synthesis.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and exist in different chemical environments. It is expected that they would give distinct NMR spectra. A single proton type, like the alpha-proton, would show a separate peak for each diastereomer. If the diastereomers were formed in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., from a racemic starting material), their corresponding NMR peaks would have equal integrals. This perfectly matches the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard liquid chromatography, resulting in two distinct peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. The equal LC peak intensities confirm the 1:1 ratio.\n        *   This explanation is consistent with all the experimental evidence provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species with the same mass but different NMR and LC properties points directly to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of the observations:**\n    1.  **¹H NMR:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which do not arise from spin-spin coupling, indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals suggest these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct compounds that elute at different times. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both of these compounds have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would involve the addition of an extra amino acid, leading to a product with a higher molecular weight. This is also contradicted by the MS data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and have identical NMR spectra. Therefore, they would not produce two separate peaks for the alpha-proton. While they can be separated by chiral LC, they would co-elute as a single peak on a standard achiral LC column typically used for LC-MS. Thus, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because their chemical environments are different, corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton. Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, which is consistent with both LC peaks showing the same mass spectrum. This scenario is common in peptide synthesis, where epimerization at one of the chiral alpha-carbons can occur, converting an L-amino acid residue to a D-amino acid residue (or vice-versa), resulting in a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H. This means there's one proton in total, but it exists in two different chemical environments.\n        *   **Exclusion:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting isn't due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities and, crucially, both give the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected mass of the target peptide. The analysis is done at an elevated temperature.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (The Options):**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties in both chiral and achiral environments.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two complete sets of peaks. It's plausible that for many protons the peaks overlap, but for a specific proton (like the alpha-proton mentioned), two distinct signals could be resolved. This fits the observation.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This explains the two peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which explains why the mass spectra are identical. This also fits the observation perfectly.\n        *   **A common example in peptides:** A very common source of diastereomers in peptides is *cis-trans* isomerism around the amide bond, particularly for bonds involving a proline residue. These isomers (often called rotamers) interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale at room temperature, giving rise to two sets of signals. They are also separable by LC. The \"elevated temperature\" in the LC-MS might be relevant to the rate of this interconversion. This scenario is a specific type of diastereomerism.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Definition:** This implies a side reaction that changes the chemical structure, for example, by adding an extra amino acid or forming a branched structure.\n        *   **Consistency:** Such a reaction would create a new molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a *different mass*. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Definition:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis.\n        *   **Consistency:** Like the side product in option B, a precursor would have a different chemical structure and a *different mass* from the final product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are chemically identical and indistinguishable. They would give a single, identical NMR spectrum. You would not see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light) and cannot be separated by standard LC. A special chiral column would be required.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and the LC data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The only explanation that accounts for all the observations—two species that are distinguishable by both NMR and LC but have the identical mass—is that they are diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this suggests the presence of two different species in the sample. The fact that the exchange between these two species is slow on the NMR timescale (otherwise, a single, broadened peak would be observed) points towards isomerism. The similar chemical shifts suggest the two environments are structurally similar. The roughly equal integrals imply that the two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC (Liquid Chromatography) separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). The observation of two separate peaks confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated by chromatography. The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected product. This is a crucial piece of information: the two species are not a product and a precursor/impurity of a different mass; they are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass). The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the NMR data, suggesting a ~1:1 ratio of the two isomers. The mention of \"elevated temperature\" is a hint towards a dynamic process; for some isomers like conformers, raising the temperature can increase the rate of interconversion, which can affect the chromatography.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a procedural step in synthesis to improve yield. It would not result in two isomeric products.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard NMR experiment (without a chiral reagent) or on a standard (achiral) LC column. This contradicts both the NMR and LC observations.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is restricted rotation around the amide (C-N) bond. This creates cis and trans conformers (also known as rotamers or atropisomers), which are diastereomeric.\n        *   **NMR:** Because the chemical environments are different in the cis and trans forms, they give rise to separate sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum. The interconversion between them is often slow at room temperature, leading to two distinct peaks for the same proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different 3D shapes and polarities, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, resulting in two peaks. As isomers, they would have the identical mass spectrum.\n        *   This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two NMR peaks for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra for both species.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR is the hallmark of a mixture of diastereomers. In a peptide, this is most commonly due to cis/trans isomerism about an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Data:** Let's break down the key experimental observations provided.\n    *   **Compound:** A chemically synthesized small peptide. Peptides are chains of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Amino acids (except glycine) are chiral.\n    *   **¹H NMR Observation:** The spectrum for a specific alpha-proton (a proton on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of an amino acid) shows two distinct peaks.\n        *   The total area (integral) of these two peaks adds up to one proton (1H).\n        *   The individual integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal.\n        *   This means the sample contains two different species, in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and in both species, there is an alpha-proton in a slightly different chemical environment.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, meaning the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **LC-MS Observation:**\n        *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio that can be separated based on their physical properties (interaction with the chromatography column).\n        *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis shows that both of these separated peaks have the exact same mass.\n        *   This mass corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide molecule.\n        *   This tells us the two species are isomers – they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n        *   The analysis was done at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks are still \"clearly defined,\" which suggests the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert under these conditions.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with polarized light).\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC.\n        *   This option contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a molecule used in an earlier step of the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data clearly shows both separated components have the *same mass* as the final product, not a different mass corresponding to a precursor.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This is not a standard chemical term. If it implies an accidental addition of an extra amino acid, for instance, the resulting molecule would have a significantly different (higher) mass.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data, which shows the mass is correct for the expected molecule.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptides is epimerization at one alpha-carbon (e.g., a mix of L-Ala-L-Val and D-Ala-L-Val) or *cis/trans* isomerism about the amide bond.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. They will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for a mixture of diastereomers to show two sets of peaks for protons, especially those near the point of isomerism (like an alpha-proton). The observation of two peaks for the same proton is perfectly explained.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) LC. The observation of two LC peaks is expected. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. The observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum is also perfectly explained.\n        *   Therefore, this option is consistent with all the experimental data provided. The two species are isomers (same mass) that are not enantiomers (separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR). This is the definition of diastereomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two NMR signals for a single proton and two separable LC peaks with identical mass is the classic signature of a sample containing a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic problem in peptide analysis that points to a specific type of isomerism. Let's break down the evidence provided.\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the total integral is correct (1H).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This tells us that the alpha-proton exists in two distinct chemical environments. Since it's the same proton on the same molecule, this means there must be two different forms (isomers) of the molecule present in solution, in approximately a 1:1 ratio. The fact that we see two sharp peaks instead of one broad peak indicates that the exchange between these two forms is slow on the NMR timescale (typically, the rate of exchange is less than the difference in frequency between the two peaks).\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities at elevated temperature.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The liquid chromatography (LC) is able to physically separate the two forms of the molecule. This confirms they are distinct chemical species. The \"elevated temperature\" is a key clue; it often helps to sharpen peaks for compounds that are slowly interconverting, suggesting an energy barrier between the two forms.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass) and not an impurity like a precursor or a side-product from \"double coupling,\" both of which would have different masses.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). They would also give different NMR spectra. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **cis-trans isomerism** around the amide bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond in an amide, rotation is restricted, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomers and interconvert slowly, fitting all the observations perfectly: two species, same mass, separable by LC, and giving distinct NMR signals. This is especially common for X-Proline amide bonds. Another possibility is epimerization at an alpha-carbon during synthesis, which also produces diastereomers. In either case, the observation points to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished or separated by standard ¹H NMR or standard LC. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, resulting in a product with a higher molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule, directly refutes this. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would have a different chemical structure and almost certainly a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data rules this out. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of two isomers that are separable by standard analytical techniques and have the same mass. This eliminates enantiomers and impurities of different masses. The two species must be diastereomers. The most common phenomenon that explains this exact set of data in peptides is the slow interconversion of *cis* and *trans* isomers around an amide bond, which are a specific type of diastereomer called atropisomers or rotamers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The observation of two peaks for a single proton, with equal integrals summing to the expected value (1H), suggests the presence of two distinct chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers of some kind. The similar chemical shifts indicate that the chemical environments of the proton in the two species are very similar, but not identical.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The presence of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that there are two different compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity). The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, and that this mass is consistent with the expected product, confirms that these two compounds are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and mass but different three-dimensional arrangements. The separation is observed even at elevated temperatures, indicating that these are stable isomers, not just rapidly interconverting conformers with a low energy barrier.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are thus separable by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. They are also chemically distinct, meaning they will give different NMR spectra. For a peptide, this could easily arise from the racemization of an amino acid chiral center during synthesis, leading to, for example, a mixture of an L-L peptide and an L-D peptide. These are diastereomers. This explanation is fully consistent with both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC and give identical standard NMR spectra. To see two peaks, you would need a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent/reagent. This explanation contradicts the observations.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product. The mass spectrum data, which shows a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule for both peaks, rules out this possibility.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different chemical compound, almost certainly with a different mass (usually lower). The mass spectrum data, showing both peaks have the same, correct mass, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two distinct peaks in both NMR and standard LC, but with the same mass) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:** Let's list the key pieces of experimental evidence provided:\n    *   **Sample:** A chemically synthesized small peptide.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   The two peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal (1:1 ratio), and their sum is correct (1H).\n        *   The peak splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **LC-MS (at elevated temperature):**\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   The intensities (areas) of the two peaks are equal (1:1 ratio).\n        *   Both peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum.\n        *   The mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different molecular weight.\n        *   The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the *expected product*. This observation directly contradicts the possibility of contamination with a precursor. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral (non-chiral) environment.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks, not two. You would only see two sets of peaks if you used a chiral solvent or a chiral shift reagent.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard, achiral LC column, enantiomers are not separated. They would co-elute as a single peak. You would need a chiral stationary phase to separate them.\n        *   Since both the NMR and LC show two distinct signals under what we assume are standard (achiral) conditions, this cannot be a mixture of enantiomers. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, this is a common side reaction where an amino acid's alpha-carbon stereocenter inverts (epimerizes) during the harsh conditions of activation or coupling. For example, if you are making a dipeptide from two L-amino acids (L-AA1 and L-AA2), epimerization of L-AA1 could lead to a mixture of the desired L-L peptide and the undesired D-L peptide. These two peptides (L-L and D-L) are diastereomers.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties because the relative spatial arrangement of their atoms is different. This means their nuclei experience different magnetic environments. Consequently, they will have distinct NMR spectra. A specific proton, like the alpha-proton mentioned, will have a different chemical shift in each diastereomer, leading to two separate peaks, as observed. A 1:1 ratio of integrals suggests the epimerization process was extensive.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers (same atoms, just arranged differently), they have the identical molecular formula and thus the identical molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n        *   This explanation fits all the provided evidence perfectly.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   \"Double coupling\" would imply that an extra molecule has been added to the peptide, for example, a second peptide chain attaching to the first.\n        *   This would create a new product with a significantly different and larger molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows that the mass of the compounds in both peaks corresponds to the *expected* molecule, not a larger one. This rules out double coupling. So, D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable species by standard LC that have the same mass but different NMR spectra is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a well-known problem in peptide synthesis caused by epimerization at a chiral alpha-carbon.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. The total integral is correct (1H), and the integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal. This indicates the presence of two different chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the protons corresponding to these two peaks must be in slightly different chemical environments. This immediately rules out enantiomers (C), as enantiomers are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment and would produce a single peak.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) step separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio that have different physical properties, allowing for their separation on a chromatography column. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the exact same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. However, they have different three-dimensional arrangements and therefore different physical properties. This means they can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). Because they are structurally different, corresponding protons in each diastereomer are in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This option is perfectly consistent with all observations: two peaks in the LC, same mass for both peaks in the MS, and two distinct signals for the same proton in the NMR. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon) during a coupling reaction.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction forming a product with a different covalent structure (e.g., a dimer or a branched peptide). Such a product would almost certainly have a different mass from the expected molecule, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC and would appear as a single peak. They are also indistinguishable by standard NMR. This contradicts both the LC and NMR data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (starting material) would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass than the final product. The MS data, which shows both LC peaks having the same, expected mass, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, identical mass for both) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. The observation that the LC peaks are still clearly defined at *elevated temperature* further strengthens this conclusion over other possibilities like slowly-interconverting conformers (rotamers), as heat would cause rotamer peaks to coalesce.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a systematic evaluation of analytical chemistry data (NMR and LC-MS) to deduce the nature of a sample. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate each option.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Data:**\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Integrals:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton. This indicates there are two different chemical species present in an approximately 1:1 ratio, and in each species, that alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment.\n    *   **Coupling:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to neighboring protons. This reinforces the idea that two different molecular species are present.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    *   **Intensities:** The peaks have equal intensities, which confirms the ~1:1 ratio of the two species observed in the NMR. The separation on LC means the two species have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), allowing them to be separated by the chromatography column.\n    *   **Mass Spectrum (MS):** Both LC peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass corresponds to the expected molecule. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers – they have the same atomic composition and molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms in space.\n    *   **Temperature:** The analysis was run at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks remained \"clearly defined.\" This suggests that the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert, even with added thermal energy. If they were rapidly interconverting conformers, the peaks would likely broaden and coalesce at a higher temperature.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts. A 1:1 mixture would show two peaks of equal intensity for a given proton. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks. As they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight, so they would give identical mass spectra. This perfectly matches the LC-MS data.\n    *   **How could they form?** This could happen if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure, or if racemization (epimerization) occurred at one of the chiral centers during the synthesis. Another common source in peptides is the presence of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (e.g., involving proline), which are a form of diastereomers known as rotamers or atropisomers.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **NMR/LC:** Standard NMR and standard LC use achiral environments (solvents, columns). Therefore, they cannot distinguish between or separate enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would show only a *single* set of peaks in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC. This contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This implies a side reaction where an extra amino acid or other group was added. This would result in a product with a different molecular formula and therefore a **different molecular weight**.\n    *   **MS:** The mass spectrum would be different from the expected molecule. The data clearly states both peaks have a mass spectrum consistent with the *expected* molecule. This option is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor (starting material or intermediate) would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and **a different molecular weight** than the final product.\n    *   **MS:** Like option C, this would lead to a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that accounts for all the observations—two species in a 1:1 ratio that are separable by LC but have the same mass—is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of spectroscopic and chromatographic data to deduce the nature of a synthetic peptide sample. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals sum to 1H, with each peak integrating to roughly 0.5H.\n*   **Interpretation:** The fact that a single proton in the molecule gives rise to two separate signals indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals (0.5H + 0.5H) suggest that these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two peaks must represent two different species.\n\n**2. Analysis of the LC-MS Data:**\n\n*   **Observation 1 (LC):** Liquid chromatography (LC) at elevated temperature resolves the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity.\n*   **Interpretation 1 (LC):** Standard LC techniques (like reversed-phase HPLC) separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). The presence of two peaks demonstrates that the sample contains two different chemical species that can be separated. The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR. The \"elevated temperature\" condition helps to rule out slowly interconverting conformational isomers (rotamers), such as those around proline amide bonds, which would likely coalesce into a single, possibly broad, peak at higher temperatures. The fact that the peaks remain clearly defined suggests they are stable, non-interconverting species under these conditions.\n\n*   **Observation 2 (MS):** Both separated peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the molecular weight of the expected target peptide.\n*   **Interpretation 2 (MS):** Mass spectrometry (MS) measures the mass-to-charge ratio of molecules. The fact that both species have the same mass means they are isomers—molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected peptide. The MS data directly contradicts this, as the observed mass matches the expected molecule.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (e.g., a starting amino acid or a smaller peptide fragment) would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight. Again, the MS data refutes this possibility.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore:\n    *   They would not be resolved by a standard (achiral) LC column; they would elute together as a single peak.\n    *   They are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, producing only one set of peaks.\n    *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has at least two chiral centers, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of these centers. In peptide synthesis, racemization (or, more precisely, epimerization) of one amino acid's alpha-carbon can lead to the formation of a diastereomer. For example, coupling L-Ala to L-Phe could yield the desired L-Ala-L-Phe and the diastereomeric D-Ala-L-Phe.\n    *   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and are chemically distinct.\n    *   **NMR:** They will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton of the epimerized residue, will have slightly different chemical shifts in the two diastereomers. This perfectly explains the two observed alpha-proton peaks.\n    *   **LC:** Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard chromatographic techniques. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace.\n    *   **MS:** As isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the identical, correct mass spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two sets of signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and an identical mass for both species is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis where one of the chiral centers epimerizes during a coupling or deprotection step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The presence of two peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, suggests the existence of two distinct chemical species in the sample. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers. The fact that their signals are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio indicates they are in approximately equal concentration. Enantiomers are indistinguishable by standard 1H NMR (an achiral technique), so they would not give two separate peaks. Therefore, the two species must be diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers have different spatial arrangements but are not mirror images, leading to different chemical environments for their protons, which results in different chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates compounds based on their physical properties. The observation of two distinct peaks confirms the presence of two different species that can be separated by chromatography. The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule, confirms they are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass). Mass spectrometry itself cannot distinguish between isomers like diastereoisomers or enantiomers. However, standard (achiral) LC can separate diastereoisomers but not enantiomers. The fact that two peaks are observed supports the diastereoisomer hypothesis. The equal intensities of the LC peaks align with the equal integrals in the NMR, confirming a ~1:1 mixture. The use of elevated temperature further supports this, as it indicates the two species are stable isomers and not, for example, rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers) which might coalesce into a single peak at higher temperatures.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would likely have a different mass, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the target compound.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling':** This refers to a procedural step in synthesis to ensure a reaction goes to completion. It does not generate an isomeric byproduct.\n    *   **C) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** This explanation is consistent with all the data. Diastereoisomers are separable by standard LC, have identical masses, and give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. A common side reaction in peptide synthesis is epimerization at an alpha-carbon, which would convert some of the desired diastereomer into another, explaining their presence in the crude mixture.\n    *   **D) Mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect because enantiomers are not distinguishable by standard NMR or standard (achiral) LC. They would produce only one peak in both analyses.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are distinguishable by NMR and standard LC but have the same mass is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The key observation is the presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals summing to one proton equivalent suggests that there are two distinct molecular species present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and each species contains one of these alpha-protons.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species, as they separate into two peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product, confirms that these two species are isomers of each other (i.e., they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms). The equal intensities of the LC peaks correlate with the equal integrals in the NMR spectrum, reinforcing the idea of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This contradicts the LC-MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the product.\n\n    *   **B) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and, crucially, different NMR spectra in a standard achiral solvent. They can also be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The presence of two separable isomers with distinct NMR signals is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In peptide chemistry, this can happen in two common ways:\n        1.  **Racemization:** One of the chiral alpha-carbons of an amino acid residue might have inverted its stereochemistry during the synthesis (e.g., L-amino acid converting to a D-amino acid). If the peptide contains other chiral centers, the product will be a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe are diastereomers).\n        2.  **Atropisomerism (Rotamers):** There is a high energy barrier to rotation around the amide (peptide) bond. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are rotamers, and if the peptide is chiral, the *cis* and *trans* rotamers are diastereomers of each other. This phenomenon is particularly common for peptide bonds preceding a proline residue. These rotamers interconvert, but often slowly enough to be observed as separate species by NMR and sometimes even be separated by LC. This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two isomeric species (same mass) that are distinct in both NMR and LC. The elevated temperature for LC-MS might be required for good chromatography, but the energy barrier is still high enough for the rotamers to be resolved on the column.\n\n    *   **C) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they are indistinguishable by standard 1H NMR (they would give a single set of peaks) and cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling':** This term is ambiguous, but it implies a side reaction that would likely lead to a product with a different structure and possibly a different mass (e.g., an isopeptide bond or anhydride formation). While it might produce an isomer in some specific cases, the term \"mixture of diastereoisomers\" (B) is a more precise and general description of the observed species that perfectly aligns with the analytical data. The most common reason for these observations in peptide analysis is the formation of diastereomers, either through racemization or, more frequently, through cis/trans isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two isomers that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR points directly to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for what should be a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and a roughly 1:1 integral ratio. Spin-spin coupling is not the cause.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This strongly indicates the presence of two different species in the sample. Since the chemical shifts are similar, these two species must be structurally very similar. The 1:1 ratio suggests they are present in equal amounts. Because they are not due to coupling, they must represent two distinct chemical environments for the same proton. This points towards isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities (correlating with the 1:1 ratio in the NMR). The analysis was run at an elevated temperature.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks in LC confirms that there are two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass), not an impurity with a different chemical formula (like a precursor or a side product from an incomplete or incorrect reaction). The elevated temperature condition suggests that if the two species were rapidly interconverting conformers, they might have coalesced into a single peak. Seeing two sharp peaks suggests they are either stable isomers or conformers with a high energy barrier to interconversion.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The MS data shows both species have the same, expected mass.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   They are different chemical compounds with different physical properties. Therefore, they will have **different NMR spectra** (even if the differences are small, as observed) and can be **separated by standard LC**, which explains the two peaks.\n        *   This scenario can arise in peptide synthesis in two common ways:\n            1.  **Use of a racemic starting material:** If one of the amino acid building blocks was a mixture of D and L forms, the final peptide would be a mixture of diastereomers. For example, synthesizing a dipeptide from pure L-Alanine and a racemic mixture of Phenylalanine would yield L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe, which are diastereomers and would be present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n            2.  **Atropisomerism (Rotamers):** Rotation around the amide (peptide) bond is restricted. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers, which are a type of diastereomer. These rotamers have different chemical environments and are often observable as separate species in NMR and can sometimes be separated by LC.\n        *   This option is fully consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that would create a new molecule with a different chemical structure and, crucially, a **different mass**. This is inconsistent with the MS data showing the expected mass for both peaks.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In an achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   A standard 1H NMR spectrometer is achiral, so a mixture of enantiomers gives a **single, identical spectrum**. You would only see one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   Standard LC columns are also achiral and **cannot separate enantiomers**. You would only see one LC peak.\n        *   This option is directly contradicted by both the NMR and LC data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that cohesively explains all the evidence—two NMR signals for a single proton type, two separable peaks by LC, and the same mass for both species—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptide. Peptides are chiral molecules, containing at least one chiral center at the alpha-carbon of each amino acid (except glycine).\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   These peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The combined integral of the two peaks is 1H, which is correct for one proton.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are \"roughly equal,\" suggesting an approximately 1:1 ratio of the two species responsible for the peaks.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\n    *   **LC-MS:**\n        *   The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, again with \"equal intensities,\" confirming a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n        *   The analysis was performed at an \"elevated temperature.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate what each piece of data implies:**\n    *   **Two peaks in NMR and LC:** This strongly indicates the sample is a mixture of two different chemical species.\n    *   **Same Mass Spectrum (MS):** This is a critical clue. If the two species had the same mass, they must be isomers of each other (i.e., they have the same chemical formula but a different arrangement of atoms). This immediately makes options involving precursors or side products with different formulas (like an extra amino acid) highly unlikely.\n    *   **Distinct NMR spectra and LC separation:** The fact that the two species can be separated by LC and have different NMR chemical shifts means they have different physical properties.\n\n3.  **Assess the given options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. This contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the final product. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would likely mean an extra amino acid has been added to some of the peptide chains. Like a precursor, this would result in a different molecular weight, which contradicts the MS data. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), enantiomers have identical physical properties.\n        *   Therefore, they would **not** separate into two peaks on a standard LC column and would give an **identical** NMR spectrum (i.e., only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two).\n        *   To distinguish enantiomers, one would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent/reagent), which is not mentioned and is not the standard assumption. This option contradicts both the NMR and LC data. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with two or more chiral centers when the configuration is different at one or more, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   **Plausible Scenario:** During peptide synthesis, if a non-enantiopure amino acid (a 1:1 mixture of L- and D-forms, i.e., a racemic mixture) was accidentally used to extend a chiral peptide chain, the result would be a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. For example, coupling racemic Alanine (D-Ala/L-Ala) to L-Valine would produce L-Val-D-Ala and L-Val-L-Ala. These two products are diastereomers.\n        *   **Properties:** Diastereomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with Data:**\n            *   **NMR:** Because they are different compounds with different 3D shapes, their protons exist in slightly different chemical environments. This would lead to two different sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum, explaining the two peaks observed for the alpha-proton. A 1:1 mixture of diastereomers would give peaks with equal integrals.\n            *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the exact same molecular weight, explaining the identical mass spectra. This fits the observations perfectly. The fact that the peaks are still separate at elevated temperature suggests they are stable isomers, not rapidly interconverting rotamers, which further strengthens the case for diastereomers arising from a fixed chiral center.\n\n**Conclusion:** A mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

It proves that the two species are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms. This definitively rules out impurities or side-products that would have a different mass.\n        *   **Elevated Temperature Condition:** The separation is successful even at elevated temperatures, suggesting the isomers are stable and have a significant energy barrier to interconversion.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Evidence**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   In standard (achiral) NMR and standard (achiral) LC, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a *single* NMR peak and a *single* LC peak.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. A common cause in peptide synthesis is epimerization (inversion of a chiral center) or the presence of stable *cis/trans* rotamers around an amide bond.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the **same mass**. This matches the MS data.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they are **separable by standard LC**. This matches the LC data.\n        *   Because their protons are in different chemical environments, they produce **distinct NMR spectra**. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate. It would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different mass** from the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This implies a side reaction that added an extra chemical group (e.g., another amino acid). This would result in a product with a **different mass**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nThe evidence strongly points to the presence of two isomers that are not enantiomers. By definition, isomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers. This is the only option that accounts for all the data: two distinct species separable by LC, giving different NMR signals, but possessing the identical mass of the expected product.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton.

LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule.

This means the two peaks represent the same proton in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   Two separate peaks are observed in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   The intensities of these two LC peaks are equal. This indicates the two species are present in a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Both LC peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the target molecule. This proves that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass) of the expected compound.\n        *   The observation of two peaks at an *elevated temperature* is a key clue. It suggests the two species are stable and do not interconvert rapidly upon heating. If they were, for example, rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers), heating would cause their signals to merge (coalesce) into a single peak.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations (the options provided):**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a vague term, but any side reaction that involves adding an extra molecule or fragment (like a \"double\" coupling) would result in a product with a different mass. Again, the MS data contradicts this. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. They would give only *one* peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC rules out enantiomers. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This can happen in peptide synthesis if one of the amino acid starting materials was a racemic mixture (a mix of L and D forms) or if epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) occurred at one of the alpha-carbons during the synthesis.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and exist in different chemical environments. It is expected that they would give distinct NMR spectra. A single proton type, like the alpha-proton, would show a separate peak for each diastereomer. If the diastereomers were formed in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., from a racemic starting material), their corresponding NMR peaks would have equal integrals. This perfectly matches the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard liquid chromatography, resulting in two distinct peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. The equal LC peak intensities confirm the 1:1 ratio.\n        *   This explanation is consistent with all the experimental evidence provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species with the same mass but different NMR and LC properties points directly to a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of the observations:**\n    1.  **¹H NMR:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which do not arise from spin-spin coupling, indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals suggest these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct compounds that elute at different times. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both of these compounds have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would involve the addition of an extra amino acid, leading to a product with a higher molecular weight. This is also contradicted by the MS data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and have identical NMR spectra. Therefore, they would not produce two separate peaks for the alpha-proton. While they can be separated by chiral LC, they would co-elute as a single peak on a standard achiral LC column typically used for LC-MS. Thus, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because their chemical environments are different, corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton. Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, which is consistent with both LC peaks showing the same mass spectrum. This scenario is common in peptide synthesis, where epimerization at one of the chiral alpha-carbons can occur, converting an L-amino acid residue to a D-amino acid residue (or vice-versa), resulting in a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H. This means there's one proton in total, but it exists in two different chemical environments.\n        *   **Exclusion:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting isn't due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities and, crucially, both give the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected mass of the target peptide. The analysis is done at an elevated temperature.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (The Options):**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties in both chiral and achiral environments.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two complete sets of peaks. It's plausible that for many protons the peaks overlap, but for a specific proton (like the alpha-proton mentioned), two distinct signals could be resolved. This fits the observation.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This explains the two peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which explains why the mass spectra are identical. This also fits the observation perfectly.\n        *   **A common example in peptides:** A very common source of diastereomers in peptides is *cis-trans* isomerism around the amide bond, particularly for bonds involving a proline residue. These isomers (often called rotamers) interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale at room temperature, giving rise to two sets of signals. They are also separable by LC. The \"elevated temperature\" in the LC-MS might be relevant to the rate of this interconversion. This scenario is a specific type of diastereomerism.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Definition:** This implies a side reaction that changes the chemical structure, for example, by adding an extra amino acid or forming a branched structure.\n        *   **Consistency:** Such a reaction would create a new molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a *different mass*. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Definition:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis.\n        *   **Consistency:** Like the side product in option B, a precursor would have a different chemical structure and a *different mass* from the final product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are chemically identical and indistinguishable. They would give a single, identical NMR spectrum. You would not see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with plane-polarized light) and cannot be separated by standard LC. A special chiral column would be required.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and the LC data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The only explanation that accounts for all the observations—two species that are distinguishable by both NMR and LC but have the identical mass—is that they are diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this suggests the presence of two different species in the sample. The fact that the exchange between these two species is slow on the NMR timescale (otherwise, a single, broadened peak would be observed) points towards isomerism. The similar chemical shifts suggest the two environments are structurally similar. The roughly equal integrals imply that the two species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC (Liquid Chromatography) separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). The observation of two separate peaks confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species that can be separated by chromatography. The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected product. This is a crucial piece of information: the two species are not a product and a precursor/impurity of a different mass; they are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass). The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the NMR data, suggesting a ~1:1 ratio of the two isomers. The mention of \"elevated temperature\" is a hint towards a dynamic process; for some isomers like conformers, raising the temperature can increase the rate of interconversion, which can affect the chromatography.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a procedural step in synthesis to improve yield. It would not result in two isomeric products.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard NMR experiment (without a chiral reagent) or on a standard (achiral) LC column. This contradicts both the NMR and LC observations.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is restricted rotation around the amide (C-N) bond. This creates cis and trans conformers (also known as rotamers or atropisomers), which are diastereomeric.\n        *   **NMR:** Because the chemical environments are different in the cis and trans forms, they give rise to separate sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum. The interconversion between them is often slow at room temperature, leading to two distinct peaks for the same proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different 3D shapes and polarities, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, resulting in two peaks. As isomers, they would have the identical mass spectrum.\n        *   This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two NMR peaks for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra for both species.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR is the hallmark of a mixture of diastereomers. In a peptide, this is most commonly due to cis/trans isomerism about an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Data:** Let's break down the key experimental observations provided.\n    *   **Compound:** A chemically synthesized small peptide. Peptides are chains of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Amino acids (except glycine) are chiral.\n    *   **¹H NMR Observation:** The spectrum for a specific alpha-proton (a proton on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of an amino acid) shows two distinct peaks.\n        *   The total area (integral) of these two peaks adds up to one proton (1H).\n        *   The individual integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal.\n        *   This means the sample contains two different species, in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and in both species, there is an alpha-proton in a slightly different chemical environment.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, meaning the splitting is not due to adjacent protons.\n    *   **LC-MS Observation:**\n        *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio that can be separated based on their physical properties (interaction with the chromatography column).\n        *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis shows that both of these separated peaks have the exact same mass.\n        *   This mass corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide molecule.\n        *   This tells us the two species are isomers – they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n        *   The analysis was done at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks are still \"clearly defined,\" which suggests the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert under these conditions.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties (except for their interaction with polarized light).\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR and a single peak in the LC.\n        *   This option contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a molecule used in an earlier step of the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data clearly shows both separated components have the *same mass* as the final product, not a different mass corresponding to a precursor.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This is not a standard chemical term. If it implies an accidental addition of an extra amino acid, for instance, the resulting molecule would have a significantly different (higher) mass.\n        *   This option contradicts the MS data, which shows the mass is correct for the expected molecule.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. A common example in peptides is epimerization at one alpha-carbon (e.g., a mix of L-Ala-L-Val and D-Ala-L-Val) or *cis/trans* isomerism about the amide bond.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. They will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for a mixture of diastereomers to show two sets of peaks for protons, especially those near the point of isomerism (like an alpha-proton). The observation of two peaks for the same proton is perfectly explained.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) LC. The observation of two LC peaks is expected. Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. The observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum is also perfectly explained.\n        *   Therefore, this option is consistent with all the experimental data provided. The two species are isomers (same mass) that are not enantiomers (separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR). This is the definition of diastereomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two NMR signals for a single proton and two separable LC peaks with identical mass is the classic signature of a sample containing a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic problem in peptide analysis that points to a specific type of isomerism. Let's break down the evidence provided.\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the total integral is correct (1H).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This tells us that the alpha-proton exists in two distinct chemical environments. Since it's the same proton on the same molecule, this means there must be two different forms (isomers) of the molecule present in solution, in approximately a 1:1 ratio. The fact that we see two sharp peaks instead of one broad peak indicates that the exchange between these two forms is slow on the NMR timescale (typically, the rate of exchange is less than the difference in frequency between the two peaks).\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities at elevated temperature.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The liquid chromatography (LC) is able to physically separate the two forms of the molecule. This confirms they are distinct chemical species. The \"elevated temperature\" is a key clue; it often helps to sharpen peaks for compounds that are slowly interconverting, suggesting an energy barrier between the two forms.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass) and not an impurity like a precursor or a side-product from \"double coupling,\" both of which would have different masses.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). They would also give different NMR spectra. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **cis-trans isomerism** around the amide bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond in an amide, rotation is restricted, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomers and interconvert slowly, fitting all the observations perfectly: two species, same mass, separable by LC, and giving distinct NMR signals. This is especially common for X-Proline amide bonds. Another possibility is epimerization at an alpha-carbon during synthesis, which also produces diastereomers. In either case, the observation points to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished or separated by standard ¹H NMR or standard LC. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, resulting in a product with a higher molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule, directly refutes this. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would have a different chemical structure and almost certainly a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data rules this out. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of two isomers that are separable by standard analytical techniques and have the same mass. This eliminates enantiomers and impurities of different masses. The two species must be diastereomers. The most common phenomenon that explains this exact set of data in peptides is the slow interconversion of *cis* and *trans* isomers around an amide bond, which are a specific type of diastereomer called atropisomers or rotamers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The observation of two peaks for a single proton, with equal integrals summing to the expected value (1H), suggests the presence of two distinct chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers of some kind. The similar chemical shifts indicate that the chemical environments of the proton in the two species are very similar, but not identical.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The presence of two peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms that there are two different compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity). The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, and that this mass is consistent with the expected product, confirms that these two compounds are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and mass but different three-dimensional arrangements. The separation is observed even at elevated temperatures, indicating that these are stable isomers, not just rapidly interconverting conformers with a low energy barrier.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are thus separable by standard chromatographic techniques like LC. They are also chemically distinct, meaning they will give different NMR spectra. For a peptide, this could easily arise from the racemization of an amino acid chiral center during synthesis, leading to, for example, a mixture of an L-L peptide and an L-D peptide. These are diastereomers. This explanation is fully consistent with both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC and give identical standard NMR spectra. To see two peaks, you would need a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent/reagent. This explanation contradicts the observations.\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product. The mass spectrum data, which shows a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule for both peaks, rules out this possibility.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different chemical compound, almost certainly with a different mass (usually lower). The mass spectrum data, showing both peaks have the same, correct mass, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two distinct peaks in both NMR and standard LC, but with the same mass) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:** Let's list the key pieces of experimental evidence provided:\n    *   **Sample:** A chemically synthesized small peptide.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   The two peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal (1:1 ratio), and their sum is correct (1H).\n        *   The peak splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **LC-MS (at elevated temperature):**\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   The intensities (areas) of the two peaks are equal (1:1 ratio).\n        *   Both peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum.\n        *   The mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different molecular weight.\n        *   The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the *expected product*. This observation directly contradicts the possibility of contamination with a precursor. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral (non-chiral) environment.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks, not two. You would only see two sets of peaks if you used a chiral solvent or a chiral shift reagent.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard, achiral LC column, enantiomers are not separated. They would co-elute as a single peak. You would need a chiral stationary phase to separate them.\n        *   Since both the NMR and LC show two distinct signals under what we assume are standard (achiral) conditions, this cannot be a mixture of enantiomers. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, this is a common side reaction where an amino acid's alpha-carbon stereocenter inverts (epimerizes) during the harsh conditions of activation or coupling. For example, if you are making a dipeptide from two L-amino acids (L-AA1 and L-AA2), epimerization of L-AA1 could lead to a mixture of the desired L-L peptide and the undesired D-L peptide. These two peptides (L-L and D-L) are diastereomers.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties because the relative spatial arrangement of their atoms is different. This means their nuclei experience different magnetic environments. Consequently, they will have distinct NMR spectra. A specific proton, like the alpha-proton mentioned, will have a different chemical shift in each diastereomer, leading to two separate peaks, as observed. A 1:1 ratio of integrals suggests the epimerization process was extensive.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers (same atoms, just arranged differently), they have the identical molecular formula and thus the identical molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n        *   This explanation fits all the provided evidence perfectly.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   \"Double coupling\" would imply that an extra molecule has been added to the peptide, for example, a second peptide chain attaching to the first.\n        *   This would create a new product with a significantly different and larger molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows that the mass of the compounds in both peaks corresponds to the *expected* molecule, not a larger one. This rules out double coupling. So, D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable species by standard LC that have the same mass but different NMR spectra is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a well-known problem in peptide synthesis caused by epimerization at a chiral alpha-carbon.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. The total integral is correct (1H), and the integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal. This indicates the presence of two different chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the protons corresponding to these two peaks must be in slightly different chemical environments. This immediately rules out enantiomers (C), as enantiomers are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment and would produce a single peak.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) step separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio that have different physical properties, allowing for their separation on a chromatography column. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated peaks have the exact same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass. However, they have different three-dimensional arrangements and therefore different physical properties. This means they can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). Because they are structurally different, corresponding protons in each diastereomer are in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This option is perfectly consistent with all observations: two peaks in the LC, same mass for both peaks in the MS, and two distinct signals for the same proton in the NMR. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon) during a coupling reaction.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction forming a product with a different covalent structure (e.g., a dimer or a branched peptide). Such a product would almost certainly have a different mass from the expected molecule, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the expected mass.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC and would appear as a single peak. They are also indistinguishable by standard NMR. This contradicts both the LC and NMR data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (starting material) would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass than the final product. The MS data, which shows both LC peaks having the same, expected mass, rules out this possibility.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data (two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, identical mass for both) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. The observation that the LC peaks are still clearly defined at *elevated temperature* further strengthens this conclusion over other possibilities like slowly-interconverting conformers (rotamers), as heat would cause rotamer peaks to coalesce.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a systematic evaluation of analytical chemistry data (NMR and LC-MS) to deduce the nature of a sample. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate each option.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Data:**\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Integrals:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton. This indicates there are two different chemical species present in an approximately 1:1 ratio, and in each species, that alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment.\n    *   **Coupling:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the splitting is not due to neighboring protons. This reinforces the idea that two different molecular species are present.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    *   **Intensities:** The peaks have equal intensities, which confirms the ~1:1 ratio of the two species observed in the NMR. The separation on LC means the two species have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), allowing them to be separated by the chromatography column.\n    *   **Mass Spectrum (MS):** Both LC peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass corresponds to the expected molecule. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers – they have the same atomic composition and molecular weight, but a different arrangement of atoms in space.\n    *   **Temperature:** The analysis was run at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks remained \"clearly defined.\" This suggests that the two species are stable and do not easily interconvert, even with added thermal energy. If they were rapidly interconverting conformers, the peaks would likely broaden and coalesce at a higher temperature.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts. A 1:1 mixture would show two peaks of equal intensity for a given proton. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks. As they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight, so they would give identical mass spectra. This perfectly matches the LC-MS data.\n    *   **How could they form?** This could happen if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure, or if racemization (epimerization) occurred at one of the chiral centers during the synthesis. Another common source in peptides is the presence of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (e.g., involving proline), which are a form of diastereomers known as rotamers or atropisomers.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **NMR/LC:** Standard NMR and standard LC use achiral environments (solvents, columns). Therefore, they cannot distinguish between or separate enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would show only a *single* set of peaks in the NMR and a *single* peak in the LC. This contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This implies a side reaction where an extra amino acid or other group was added. This would result in a product with a different molecular formula and therefore a **different molecular weight**.\n    *   **MS:** The mass spectrum would be different from the expected molecule. The data clearly states both peaks have a mass spectrum consistent with the *expected* molecule. This option is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor (starting material or intermediate) would almost certainly have a different chemical structure and **a different molecular weight** than the final product.\n    *   **MS:** Like option C, this would lead to a different mass spectrum. This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that accounts for all the observations—two species in a 1:1 ratio that are separable by LC but have the same mass—is that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of spectroscopic and chromatographic data to deduce the nature of a synthetic peptide sample. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals sum to 1H, with each peak integrating to roughly 0.5H.\n*   **Interpretation:** The fact that a single proton in the molecule gives rise to two separate signals indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals (0.5H + 0.5H) suggest that these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two peaks must represent two different species.\n\n**2. Analysis of the LC-MS Data:**\n\n*   **Observation 1 (LC):** Liquid chromatography (LC) at elevated temperature resolves the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity.\n*   **Interpretation 1 (LC):** Standard LC techniques (like reversed-phase HPLC) separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). The presence of two peaks demonstrates that the sample contains two different chemical species that can be separated. The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR. The \"elevated temperature\" condition helps to rule out slowly interconverting conformational isomers (rotamers), such as those around proline amide bonds, which would likely coalesce into a single, possibly broad, peak at higher temperatures. The fact that the peaks remain clearly defined suggests they are stable, non-interconverting species under these conditions.\n\n*   **Observation 2 (MS):** Both separated peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the molecular weight of the expected target peptide.\n*   **Interpretation 2 (MS):** Mass spectrometry (MS) measures the mass-to-charge ratio of molecules. The fact that both species have the same mass means they are isomers—molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected peptide. The MS data directly contradicts this, as the observed mass matches the expected molecule.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (e.g., a starting amino acid or a smaller peptide fragment) would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight. Again, the MS data refutes this possibility.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore:\n    *   They would not be resolved by a standard (achiral) LC column; they would elute together as a single peak.\n    *   They are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, producing only one set of peaks.\n    *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has at least two chiral centers, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of these centers. In peptide synthesis, racemization (or, more precisely, epimerization) of one amino acid's alpha-carbon can lead to the formation of a diastereomer. For example, coupling L-Ala to L-Phe could yield the desired L-Ala-L-Phe and the diastereomeric D-Ala-L-Phe.\n    *   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and are chemically distinct.\n    *   **NMR:** They will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton of the epimerized residue, will have slightly different chemical shifts in the two diastereomers. This perfectly explains the two observed alpha-proton peaks.\n    *   **LC:** Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard chromatographic techniques. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace.\n    *   **MS:** As isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the identical, correct mass spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two sets of signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and an identical mass for both species is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis where one of the chiral centers epimerizes during a coupling or deprotection step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The presence of two peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, suggests the existence of two distinct chemical species in the sample. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers. The fact that their signals are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio indicates they are in approximately equal concentration. Enantiomers are indistinguishable by standard 1H NMR (an achiral technique), so they would not give two separate peaks. Therefore, the two species must be diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers have different spatial arrangements but are not mirror images, leading to different chemical environments for their protons, which results in different chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates compounds based on their physical properties. The observation of two distinct peaks confirms the presence of two different species that can be separated by chromatography. The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule, confirms they are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass). Mass spectrometry itself cannot distinguish between isomers like diastereoisomers or enantiomers. However, standard (achiral) LC can separate diastereoisomers but not enantiomers. The fact that two peaks are observed supports the diastereoisomer hypothesis. The equal intensities of the LC peaks align with the equal integrals in the NMR, confirming a ~1:1 mixture. The use of elevated temperature further supports this, as it indicates the two species are stable isomers and not, for example, rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers) which might coalesce into a single peak at higher temperatures.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would likely have a different mass, which contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the target compound.\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling':** This refers to a procedural step in synthesis to ensure a reaction goes to completion. It does not generate an isomeric byproduct.\n    *   **C) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** This explanation is consistent with all the data. Diastereoisomers are separable by standard LC, have identical masses, and give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. A common side reaction in peptide synthesis is epimerization at an alpha-carbon, which would convert some of the desired diastereomer into another, explaining their presence in the crude mixture.\n    *   **D) Mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect because enantiomers are not distinguishable by standard NMR or standard (achiral) LC. They would produce only one peak in both analyses.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are distinguishable by NMR and standard LC but have the same mass is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of the NMR Data:** The key observation is the presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that the peaks have roughly equal integrals summing to one proton equivalent suggests that there are two distinct molecular species present in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and each species contains one of these alpha-protons.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species, as they separate into two peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product, confirms that these two species are isomers of each other (i.e., they have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms). The equal intensities of the LC peaks correlate with the equal integrals in the NMR spectrum, reinforcing the idea of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. This contradicts the LC-MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the product.\n\n    *   **B) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and, crucially, different NMR spectra in a standard achiral solvent. They can also be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The presence of two separable isomers with distinct NMR signals is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In peptide chemistry, this can happen in two common ways:\n        1.  **Racemization:** One of the chiral alpha-carbons of an amino acid residue might have inverted its stereochemistry during the synthesis (e.g., L-amino acid converting to a D-amino acid). If the peptide contains other chiral centers, the product will be a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe are diastereomers).\n        2.  **Atropisomerism (Rotamers):** There is a high energy barrier to rotation around the amide (peptide) bond. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are rotamers, and if the peptide is chiral, the *cis* and *trans* rotamers are diastereomers of each other. This phenomenon is particularly common for peptide bonds preceding a proline residue. These rotamers interconvert, but often slowly enough to be observed as separate species by NMR and sometimes even be separated by LC. This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two isomeric species (same mass) that are distinct in both NMR and LC. The elevated temperature for LC-MS might be required for good chromatography, but the energy barrier is still high enough for the rotamers to be resolved on the column.\n\n    *   **C) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they are indistinguishable by standard 1H NMR (they would give a single set of peaks) and cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling':** This term is ambiguous, but it implies a side reaction that would likely lead to a product with a different structure and possibly a different mass (e.g., an isopeptide bond or anhydride formation). While it might produce an isomer in some specific cases, the term \"mixture of diastereoisomers\" (B) is a more precise and general description of the observed species that perfectly aligns with the analytical data. The most common reason for these observations in peptide analysis is the formation of diastereomers, either through racemization or, more frequently, through cis/trans isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two isomers that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR points directly to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for what should be a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have similar chemical shifts and a roughly 1:1 integral ratio. Spin-spin coupling is not the cause.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This strongly indicates the presence of two different species in the sample. Since the chemical shifts are similar, these two species must be structurally very similar. The 1:1 ratio suggests they are present in equal amounts. Because they are not due to coupling, they must represent two distinct chemical environments for the same proton. This points towards isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks are seen in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities (correlating with the 1:1 ratio in the NMR). The analysis was run at an elevated temperature.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks in LC confirms that there are two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass), not an impurity with a different chemical formula (like a precursor or a side product from an incomplete or incorrect reaction). The elevated temperature condition suggests that if the two species were rapidly interconverting conformers, they might have coalesced into a single peak. Seeing two sharp peaks suggests they are either stable isomers or conformers with a high energy barrier to interconversion.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is incorrect. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and thus a different mass spectrum. The MS data shows both species have the same, expected mass.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.\n        *   They have the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   They are different chemical compounds with different physical properties. Therefore, they will have **different NMR spectra** (even if the differences are small, as observed) and can be **separated by standard LC**, which explains the two peaks.\n        *   This scenario can arise in peptide synthesis in two common ways:\n            1.  **Use of a racemic starting material:** If one of the amino acid building blocks was a mixture of D and L forms, the final peptide would be a mixture of diastereomers. For example, synthesizing a dipeptide from pure L-Alanine and a racemic mixture of Phenylalanine would yield L-Ala-L-Phe and L-Ala-D-Phe, which are diastereomers and would be present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n            2.  **Atropisomerism (Rotamers):** Rotation around the amide (peptide) bond is restricted. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers, which are a type of diastereomer. These rotamers have different chemical environments and are often observable as separate species in NMR and can sometimes be separated by LC.\n        *   This option is fully consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that would create a new molecule with a different chemical structure and, crucially, a **different mass**. This is inconsistent with the MS data showing the expected mass for both peaks.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In an achiral environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   A standard 1H NMR spectrometer is achiral, so a mixture of enantiomers gives a **single, identical spectrum**. You would only see one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   Standard LC columns are also achiral and **cannot separate enantiomers**. You would only see one LC peak.\n        *   This option is directly contradicted by both the NMR and LC data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only option that cohesively explains all the evidence—two NMR signals for a single proton type, two separable peaks by LC, and the same mass for both species—is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptide. Peptides are chiral molecules, containing at least one chiral center at the alpha-carbon of each amino acid (except glycine).\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   These peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The combined integral of the two peaks is 1H, which is correct for one proton.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are \"roughly equal,\" suggesting an approximately 1:1 ratio of the two species responsible for the peaks.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\n    *   **LC-MS:**\n        *   The analysis shows two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, again with \"equal intensities,\" confirming a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n        *   The analysis was performed at an \"elevated temperature.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate what each piece of data implies:**\n    *   **Two peaks in NMR and LC:** This strongly indicates the sample is a mixture of two different chemical species.\n    *   **Same Mass Spectrum (MS):** This is a critical clue. If the two species had the same mass, they must be isomers of each other (i.e., they have the same chemical formula but a different arrangement of atoms). This immediately makes options involving precursors or side products with different formulas (like an extra amino acid) highly unlikely.\n    *   **Distinct NMR spectra and LC separation:** The fact that the two species can be separated by LC and have different NMR chemical shifts means they have different physical properties.\n\n3.  **Assess the given options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. This contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass as the final product. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would likely mean an extra amino acid has been added to some of the peptide chains. Like a precursor, this would result in a different molecular weight, which contradicts the MS data. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), enantiomers have identical physical properties.\n        *   Therefore, they would **not** separate into two peaks on a standard LC column and would give an **identical** NMR spectrum (i.e., only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two).\n        *   To distinguish enantiomers, one would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral LC column or a chiral NMR solvent/reagent), which is not mentioned and is not the standard assumption. This option contradicts both the NMR and LC data. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with two or more chiral centers when the configuration is different at one or more, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   **Plausible Scenario:** During peptide synthesis, if a non-enantiopure amino acid (a 1:1 mixture of L- and D-forms, i.e., a racemic mixture) was accidentally used to extend a chiral peptide chain, the result would be a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. For example, coupling racemic Alanine (D-Ala/L-Ala) to L-Valine would produce L-Val-D-Ala and L-Val-L-Ala. These two products are diastereomers.\n        *   **Properties:** Diastereomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with Data:**\n            *   **NMR:** Because they are different compounds with different 3D shapes, their protons exist in slightly different chemical environments. This would lead to two different sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum, explaining the two peaks observed for the alpha-proton. A 1:1 mixture of diastereomers would give peaks with equal integrals.\n            *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the exact same molecular weight, explaining the identical mass spectra. This fits the observations perfectly. The fact that the peaks are still separate at elevated temperature suggests they are stable isomers, not rapidly interconverting rotamers, which further strengthens the case for diastereomers arising from a fixed chiral center.\n\n**Conclusion:** A mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
