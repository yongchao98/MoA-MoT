The D₂ molecule has 2p and 2n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7p and 7n. The N₂ molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen gas): Each ¹⁶O atom has 8p and 8n. The O₂ molecule has 16p and 16n. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. The CO molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): H has 1p, 0n. D has 1p, 1n. The HD molecule has 2p and 1n. This does not fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms. Heating G releases substance B, which has a melting point near 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This value is remarkably close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly implies that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Connecting the clues:** If heating G releases D₂O (B), then G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, a compound that loses D₂O upon heating (a process similar to dehydration). The fact that D₂O is a product points to Deuterium being a key component of the system. This also supports D₂ as the identity of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We need a substance (X) containing Deuterium that reacts to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n    *   **Clue 6: The organic chemistry connection.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. A very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols (-OH). The product would be a diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **The violent reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts extremely violently with water. Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (s) + 4 D₂O (l) → LiOD (aq) + Al(OD)₃ (s)↓ + 4 D₂ (g)↑`\n        *   This reaction is violent.\n        *   Gas W = D₂. As established, it has an equal number of protons and neutrons (2p, 2n). This fits.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Decomposition of G:** Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose.\n        *   Reaction: `2 Al(OD)₃ (s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ (s) + 3 D₂O (g)`\n        *   This reaction releases substance B = D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. This fits.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic number (Z) = 1  **(Lightest)**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, Al = ²⁷Al).\n        *   **Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of the stable isotope of Al is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n        This points towards a compound used in isotopic labeling studies, often to trace reaction mechanisms. Deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is very commonly used for this purpose.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        Let's analyze potential gases (W) with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has p=2, n=2. This is a perfect fit, especially given the \"heavier isotope\" clue.\n        *   **N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** The common ¹⁴N isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has p=14, n=14. This is a possibility.\n        *   **Other possibilities** like CO, ¹⁸O₂, etc., are less likely in the context of a simple, violent reaction.\n        The most plausible candidate for W is D₂ gas, which strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuterated compound (contains Deuterium). A violent reaction that produces a gas often involves a highly reactive substance with a protic solvent like water. If X is a deuteride and it produces D₂ gas, the other source of deuterium atoms must be the liquid Y. Therefore, **Liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n    *   **Let's propose a candidate for X.** A very common deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is the deuterated analog of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against the clues.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.**\n        The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O.\n        The products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and **Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, which is insoluble and would form a precipitate (G). This fits the clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.**\n        Heating metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) often causes dehydration (or its equivalent).\n        Heating G (Al(OD)₃): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)\n        So, the released substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: 273.15 + 3.82 = **276.97 K**. This value is indeed very close to 277 K. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CD(OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n        So, the entire keto acid molecule is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). A diol contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is perfectly consistent.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n        X is LiAlD₄. Its very close analog is **LiAlH₄**. Both are cornerstone reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Interpret the calculation instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        This means we must:\n        1.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen).\n        2.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\n        3.  Sum these two totals.\n    *   **Perform the calculation using integer mass numbers (as the options are integers):**\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   The main isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** aluminium atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B and identify G.**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition reaction for a hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide. Given that a precipitate (G) is formed in the initial reaction, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1 & 10: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This, combined with the presence of deuterium, points towards common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs (LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄) are staples in organic chemistry.\n\n4.  **Propose identities for X, Y, W, and G and test the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlD₄ is known to react violently with water and similar protic solvents.\n    *   **Formation of gas W:** Clue 3 states that gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD. The gas is HD (Hydrogen Deuteride). Let's check its composition: Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. So, Y is not H₂O.\n        *   What if liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)? The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n        *   Let's check the gas W = D₂ (Deuterium gas). Composition: Protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Neutrons = 1 + 1 = 2. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **Formation of precipitate G:** In this reaction, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so it's certain that Al(OD)₃ would be a precipitate as well. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Clue 9: The reaction with a keto acid.**\n    A keto acid has both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols (hydroxyl groups, -OH).\n    *   Ketone reduction: R-CO-R' → R-CD(OH)-R'\n    *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n    The final product would be a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups), for example, HO-CD₂-R'-CD(OH)-R. This molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminium. The mass number of the most stable isotope of aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Sum of the two cumulative masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances involved.**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W.** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): D is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely to be formed in the context of the other clues)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O). (Fits)\n\n    *   **Clue 2: The reaction.** \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". The release of D₂ gas strongly suggests a reaction between a deuterated reducing agent (a metal deuteride) and a proton/deuteron source like water or heavy water.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Substance B.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance G.** Since heating the precipitate G releases D₂O (B), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (the deuterated analog of a metal hydroxide), which decomposes upon heating. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n2.  **Propose a candidate for Substance X.**\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The organic chemistry context.** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and its analog, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), are extremely common and powerful reducing agents. NaBD₄/NaBH₄ is another pair.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is famous for reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). A keto acid contains both functional groups. The reduction of a keto acid (like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) with LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) followed by workup yields a diol (like 1,2-propanediol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X. The reaction would be with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. (Checks out)\n    *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   The organic chemistry reaction with a keto acid makes sense. (Checks out)\n\n    All clues point strongly to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" implies we sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements within the molecule's formula. We will use the integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Mass from lightest element) + (Mass from heaviest element)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substances X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze common gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   Other gases like N₂ (14p, 14n), O₂ (16p, 16n), CO (14p, 14n) also fit this criterion, but the clue about a \"heavier isotope\" strongly points towards Deuterium (D). So, we can hypothesize **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Substance X and Reaction:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" which we now suspect is Deuterium (D). It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen (or its isotope) is the reaction of a hydride with water.\n        *   The phrase \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n        *   The \"close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n        *   To produce pure D₂ gas from LiAlD₄, the other reactant (liquid Y) must also be a source of deuterium atoms. The most common liquid that fits this is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O. It produces D₂ gas (W). So, we can tentatively identify **Y = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces a precipitate G. In the products `LiOD + Al(OD)₃`, LiOD is soluble, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, is insoluble, just like its analog Al(OH)₃.\n        *   G (Al(OD)₃) is heated and releases B. When Al(OH)₃ is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OH)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`.\n        *   By analogy, `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So, substance **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   The problem states the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The actual melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong confirmation of our identifications.\n\n    *   **Confirmation with the Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) -> Secondary alcohol (>CHOH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains a total of 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly and rules out milder reagents like NaBD₄ (which wouldn't reduce the carboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X.**\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently conclude that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number and mass): Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number and mass): Aluminium (Al).\n\n    *   **Interpret the Calculation Instructions:** The question includes a critical clause: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This clause tells us how to calculate the mass contribution for each element.\n        *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are **four instances** in the formula LiAlD₄. Therefore, we must sum the masses of all four Deuterium atoms.\n        *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is only **one instance**.\n\n    *   **Calculate:** We will use integer mass numbers, as the options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the main isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (mass of a D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × (mass of an Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards elements like hydrogen (Deuterium, D), carbon (¹³C), etc.\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** A violent reaction with a liquid (often water) is characteristic of highly reactive hydrides or similar compounds.\n    *   **Clue 5 & 6: G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O**, confirming that the heavy isotope from Clue 1 is Deuterium (D).\n    *   If heating G produces D₂O, then G must be a deuterated hydrate or a compound that decomposes to yield D₂O, like a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 3 Revisited: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze some potential gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1) (Yes)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7) (Yes)\n        *   C₂H₄: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (Yes)\n        Given that Deuterium is central to the problem, **W = D₂** is the most plausible candidate.\n    *   **Clue 8: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This strongly suggests common laboratory reagents, very likely reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 7: The reaction product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. Powerful reducing agents like LiAlH₄ reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reaction `R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent]` yields a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`. This product molecule contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction with Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. If we assume Y is D₂O (heavy water) to produce D₂ gas, the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes decomposition into the metal oxide and water. So, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **B = D₂O**, which matches our finding from its melting point.\n    *   All clues fit perfectly with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   (Alternative check: If X were NaBD₄, the reaction `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O -> NaBO₂ + 4D₂` produces the right gas (D₂) but Sodium Metaborate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate G would form. This rules out NaBD₄).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the **cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)**. We should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z) or atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the molecule:** The formula is LiAlD₄.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is **one** atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The Melting Point of B**\n    The substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is Deuterium (²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: Formation of B from G**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` might decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1, 2, and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since D₂O is a product down the line, this heavier isotope is almost certainly **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   This reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's analyze potential gases (W). Given that Deuterium is involved, let's check hydrogen isotopes:\n        *   H₂ (normal hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n        *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n        *   **D₂ (dideuterium)**: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly!)\n    *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, both reactants should ideally be rich in Deuterium. So, X is a deuterated compound, and Y is likely D₂O. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   We are looking for a common deuterated organic reagent that reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)- and -COOH groups, for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms) is reduced by X to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups (e.g., R-C(=O)-R'-COOH → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), which has two -OH groups, hence 2 oxygens).\n    *   Common reducing agents are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. NaBH₄ is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride) is a very powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. Its analog is **LiAlD₄ (lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Heavy isotope:** Yes, it contains Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Organic reagent:** Yes, LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent, and LiAlD₄ is its well-known analog used for isotopic labeling.\n        *   **Reaction with Y = D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. The same applies to LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide), which is insoluble and forms a precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reduction:** LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, changing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. This fits.\n\n    All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1, present as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄. We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We use integer atomic mass numbers for this calculation, as is standard for such problems and suggested by the integer options.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**.\n    *   The molecule LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum). Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass of D) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This is a strong clue that we are dealing with deuterium. Normal water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0 °C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine possible diatomic gases related to the context:\n    *   H₂ (molecular hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (molecular deuterium): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (p = n).\n    This confirms that the gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, both the reagent (X) and the protic solvent it reacts with (Y) must contain only deuterium, not protium (normal hydrogen). Therefore, liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O). Substance X must be a deuterated reagent. The problem mentions X and its analog are used in organic chemistry and that the reaction is violent. This points towards a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The two most common are Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n4.  **Differentiate between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄:** The reaction between X and Y (D₂O) forms a precipitate G. Let's write the reactions:\n    *   `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    *   `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    Sodium borate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate forms. However, aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will precipitate. This means G is Al(OD)₃, and **Substance X must be LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify with other clues:**\n    *   **Heating G:** The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃. When heated, metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose. `2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g)`. This releases substance B, which we identified as D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   **Keto acid reaction:** The problem states \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It can reduce both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A typical α-keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH (containing 3 oxygen atoms). LiAlD₄ would reduce it to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This is also consistent.\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must sum the mass of the single Aluminium atom and the four Deuterium atoms in the LiAlD₄ molecule.\n    *   Since the answer options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The isotope Deuterium is ²H, with a mass number of 2.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and Liquid Y.**\n    The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n    Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This means G is a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide that loses D₂O upon heating.\n    The overall reaction involves Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and gas W. Since the products (G and B) contain deuterium (D), the liquid reactant Y must be the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\n    Gas W is released from the reaction of X and Y (D₂O). The clue is that a molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze possible gases from a reaction involving a deuteride and D₂O.\n    The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. The isotopes could be H or D.\n    *   H₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per H), 0 neutrons. Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    *   D₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Protons = Neutrons.** This fits the description.\n    *   HD molecule: 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    Therefore, **Gas W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Substance X and Precipitate G.**\n    We know that X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G.\n    X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)\n    The clue \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The \"heavier isotope\" version would be Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    Let's test X = LiAlD₄.\n    The reaction with D₂O is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃, is the precipitate G**. This is consistent because aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O, releasing D₂O (Substance B), which matches our deductions.\n    If we tested X = NaBD₄, the products would be NaOD and B(OD)₃. Boric acid and its deuterated analog are soluble in water, so no precipitate would form. Thus, X cannot be NaBD₄.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the identity of X with the final clue.**\n    The clue states: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups to alcohols (or deuterated alcohols, \"deuterols\").\n    R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (workup) → R-CH(OD)-CD₂(OD)\n    The final product is a diol (an alcohol with two hydroxyl groups, or in this case, deuteroxyl groups). It contains **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\n    The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must account for all atoms of hydrogen and aluminum in the formula.\n    *   We use integer atomic masses for the calculation, as the options are integers. Mass(Deuterium, D) = 2 amu. Mass(Aluminum, ²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × Mass(Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Final Calculation:** The cumulative sum is the sum of these two values.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B's melting point is ~277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: The heavy isotope is Deuterium (D).** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 4: Analysis of the reaction.**\n        *   Substance X (containing D) reacts violently with liquid Y.\n        *   A precipitate G is formed.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O). This implies G is a compound that can be dehydrated (or \"de-deuterated\"), such as a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal deuteroxide M(OD)ₓ when heated would yield a metal oxide and D₂O.\n        *   For G to be a metal deuteroxide, liquid Y must be the source of the OD group, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   A gas W is released, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider the reaction between a metal deuteride (a plausible form for X) and heavy water (Y). For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Let's check the gas **W = D₂**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   So far, we know X is a substance containing a metal and deuterium. The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   **Clue 5: X or its analog is a reagent in organic chemistry.** The most common hydride reagents (whose deuterated analogs are also used) are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test these candidates:\n        *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. However, both sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid (B(OD)₃) are soluble in water. No precipitate (G) would form. This contradicts the clues.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate**. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 6: Heating G releases B.** If G is Al(OD)₃, heating it would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (B), which also matches the clues.\n    *   **Clue 7: The keto acid reaction.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) and its analog LiAlH₄ are powerful reducing agents that would reduce both functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This final clue confirms our identification.\n\n3.  **Conclusion: Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass from aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated above.\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), but heavy water (D₂O) melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\". Since we've identified B as D₂O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen. Therefore, **Substance X must contain Deuterium**.\n    *   **Clue 5 & G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\". Heating metal hydroxides (M(OH)ₙ) typically yields a metal oxide and water (H₂O). By analogy, heating a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ) would yield a metal oxide and heavy water (D₂O). So, **G must be a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   **Clue 3 & W:** \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium, let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. Thus, **W is very likely D₂ gas**.\n    *   **Clue 2, 8, 9 & X:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry, and it reacts with a keto acid. These properties strongly point towards powerful reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Since X contains deuterium, the candidates are their deuterated analogs: lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBD₄).\n    *   **The Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a suitable liquid Y that would produce the identified products. The most logical reaction to produce D₂ gas is the reaction of the deuteride with heavy water (D₂O), which would also be the source for the deuteroxide precipitate.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Validation of the Reaction:**\n        *   This reaction is known to be extremely violent. (Matches clue 2)\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble), aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate), and deuterium gas (D₂). This matches the formation of precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃** and gas **W = D₂**.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces **B = D₂O**.\n        *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry. (Matches clue 9)\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) would reduce the keto group to a deuterated alcohol (R-CD(OH)-COOH). The product contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), meaning it has 2 oxygen atoms. (Matches clue 8)\n\n    *   Based on all the clues, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H). Its isotope in the molecule is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2. There are four D atoms in the formula.\n    *   The term \"cumulative atomic masses\" and \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" means we need to sum the mass of the single Al atom and the four D atoms.\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the calculation: Sum = 27 + (4 × 2)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Identify Gas W and Substance B:**\n    1.  The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze common diatomic gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, a heavier isotope of hydrogen): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit.\n    2.  This suggests that Substance X contains deuterium (D).\n    3.  Substance B has a melting point of approximately 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    1.  Substance G releases D₂O (B) when heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydroxide (like M(OD)x) or a deuterated hydrate.\n    2.  Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas D₂ and a precipitate G. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Given the presence of deuterium everywhere, it is logical to assume the reaction is between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    3.  Reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G, precipitate) + D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    4.  So, **Y is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue to Identify X:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol (`-COOH` -> `-CH₂OH`).\n        *   Therefore, X must be a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The most common reagents for this are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), with LiAlH₄ being much stronger and necessary for reducing carboxylic acids.\n    3.  The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (Deuterium), **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verify the Reaction with LiAlD₄:**\n    1.  Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    2.  This reaction is known to be violent.\n    3.  It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    4.  It produces a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    5.  When G is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    6.  All clues fit perfectly.\n\n*   **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    1.  Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    2.  The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    3.  The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    4.  The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    5.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass is 27 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). Each has a mass of approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    6.  Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical properties and reactions described, we can deduce the identities of the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". The reaction involves a deuterated compound (implied by the presence of D₂O). Let's examine possible hydrogen-based gases:\n    *   H₂: Contains 2 protons (1 from each H) and 0 neutrons. Does not match.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Contains 2 protons (1 from each D) and 2 neutrons (1 from each D). This matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance Y:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂. For D₂ to be produced, the reaction likely involves two sources of deuterium. Since Substance X is a deuterated compound and B is D₂O, the most plausible identity for the liquid reactant Y is also **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Identification of Substance X:** We are looking for a deuterated compound that is a common organic reagent, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (G). Let's test Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (Substance G).\n    *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a molecule with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium, D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (present as 1 atom of Al).\n    *   We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D has a mass number of 2; the common isotope of Al has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The nature of substance B.**\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. However, it is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify **B as D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of gas W.**\n    *   \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Since the system clearly involves deuterium (from the identification of D₂O), let's examine hydrogen and its isotopes as components of the gas.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each ¹H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n    *   HD (Protium-Deuterium): ¹H has (1p, 0n), ²H has (1p, 1n). HD molecule has 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each ²H has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has **2 protons, 2 neutrons**. (This fits the condition).\n    *   While other gases like ¹⁴N₂ (14p, 14n) or ¹²C¹⁶O (14p, 14n) also fit this numerical criterion, the presence of D₂O elsewhere in the reaction system makes D₂ the most chemically consistent candidate for gas W.\n    *   So, we identify **W as D₂ (di-deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify G, X, and Y.**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W (D₂) + Precipitate G.\n    *   Also, heating G releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2M(OD)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The fact that a precipitate forms suggests a metal hydroxide that is insoluble, such as Al(OH)₃ or Mg(OH)₂.\n    *   Let's consider **G = Al(OD)₃** (aluminum deuteroxide), as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Heating it would give: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   Now, we can assemble the reaction: X must contain Al and D. The reaction produces D₂ gas and a precipitate of Al(OD)₃ after reacting with liquid Y. To provide the oxygen and the extra deuterium for the products, Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The full reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + Al(OD)₃ + [soluble byproduct].\n    *   Let's look at Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"close analog\" incorporating a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) is **Lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n        **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD**\n    *   This is a known violent reaction. All components match our deductions:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄ (contains heavier isotope D).\n        *   Y = D₂O (liquid).\n        *   W = D₂ (gas with equal protons and neutrons).\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (precipitate). Heating gives D₂O.\n        *   B = D₂O.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Final Clue (Clue 7).**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". This means we sum the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements in one molecule of X.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **4** atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **1** atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Liquid Y**\n- The problem states that a gas W is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n- Let's analyze some simple molecules:\n    - H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n    - **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Equal)\n    - He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Equal, but a noble gas, unlikely to be a product of a violent reaction).\n    - **HF (Hydrogen Fluoride):** H (1p, 0n) + F-19 (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Equal)\n- The problem also states that a precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C or 276.97 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n- If the reaction releases D₂O, it's highly likely that deuterated compounds are involved. Specifically, if B is D₂O, the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly D₂O as well, which acts as the solvent and reactant.\n- If Y is D₂O, and the reaction is with substance X, the gas released (W) must be D₂. The reaction cannot produce HF if there is no Fluorine source. This confirms W = D₂, and the reaction involves deuterium transfer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X**\n- Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n- The prompt says, \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards deuterated versions of common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), or simpler hydrides like Lithium Hydride (LiH). The \"analog\" would be the standard hydrogen version.\n- The next clue is: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    - A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-(...)-COOH. It contains at least three oxygen atoms.\n    - To get a product with only two oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced.\n    - LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids (to alcohols). The product of reducing a keto acid would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-(...)-CH₂OH, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    - NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be R-CH(OH)-(...)-COOH, which still has three oxygen atoms.\n- Therefore, the analog of X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄. This means substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify LiAlD₄ with all clues**\n- **Formula:** LiAlD₄\n- **Heavier isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of Hydrogen. ✓\n- **Organic reagent analog:** The analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and important reagent. ✓\n- **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. This reaction is violent, similar to LiAlH₄ with water. ✓\n- **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. ✓\n- **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. ✓\n- **G releases B on heating:** Heating aluminum hydroxide dehydrates it (`2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O. So B = D₂O. ✓\n- **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. ✓\n- All clues perfectly match the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n- The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n- **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n- The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n- **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number Z).\n- **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number Z).\n- **Mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen is present as 4 atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    - Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n- **Mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** In LiAlD₄, there is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    - Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n- **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    - Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The D₂ molecule has 2p and 2n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7p and 7n. The N₂ molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen gas): Each ¹⁶O atom has 8p and 8n. The O₂ molecule has 16p and 16n. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. The CO molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): H has 1p, 0n. D has 1p, 1n. The HD molecule has 2p and 1n. This does not fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms. Heating G releases substance B, which has a melting point near 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This value is remarkably close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly implies that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Connecting the clues:** If heating G releases D₂O (B), then G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, a compound that loses D₂O upon heating (a process similar to dehydration). The fact that D₂O is a product points to Deuterium being a key component of the system. This also supports D₂ as the identity of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We need a substance (X) containing Deuterium that reacts to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n    *   **Clue 6: The organic chemistry connection.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. A very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols (-OH). The product would be a diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **The violent reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts extremely violently with water. Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (s) + 4 D₂O (l) → LiOD (aq) + Al(OD)₃ (s)↓ + 4 D₂ (g)↑`\n        *   This reaction is violent.\n        *   Gas W = D₂. As established, it has an equal number of protons and neutrons (2p, 2n). This fits.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Decomposition of G:** Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose.\n        *   Reaction: `2 Al(OD)₃ (s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ (s) + 3 D₂O (g)`\n        *   This reaction releases substance B = D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. This fits.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic number (Z) = 1  **(Lightest)**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, Al = ²⁷Al).\n        *   **Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of the stable isotope of Al is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n        This points towards a compound used in isotopic labeling studies, often to trace reaction mechanisms. Deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is very commonly used for this purpose.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        Let's analyze potential gases (W) with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has p=2, n=2. This is a perfect fit, especially given the \"heavier isotope\" clue.\n        *   **N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** The common ¹⁴N isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has p=14, n=14. This is a possibility.\n        *   **Other possibilities** like CO, ¹⁸O₂, etc., are less likely in the context of a simple, violent reaction.\n        The most plausible candidate for W is D₂ gas, which strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuterated compound (contains Deuterium). A violent reaction that produces a gas often involves a highly reactive substance with a protic solvent like water. If X is a deuteride and it produces D₂ gas, the other source of deuterium atoms must be the liquid Y. Therefore, **Liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n    *   **Let's propose a candidate for X.** A very common deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is the deuterated analog of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against the clues.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.**\n        The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O.\n        The products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and **Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, which is insoluble and would form a precipitate (G). This fits the clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.**\n        Heating metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) often causes dehydration (or its equivalent).\n        Heating G (Al(OD)₃): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)\n        So, the released substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: 273.15 + 3.82 = **276.97 K**. This value is indeed very close to 277 K. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CD(OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n        So, the entire keto acid molecule is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). A diol contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is perfectly consistent.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n        X is LiAlD₄. Its very close analog is **LiAlH₄**. Both are cornerstone reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Interpret the calculation instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        This means we must:\n        1.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen).\n        2.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\n        3.  Sum these two totals.\n    *   **Perform the calculation using integer mass numbers (as the options are integers):**\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   The main isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** aluminium atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B and identify G.**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition reaction for a hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide. Given that a precipitate (G) is formed in the initial reaction, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1 & 10: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This, combined with the presence of deuterium, points towards common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs (LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄) are staples in organic chemistry.\n\n4.  **Propose identities for X, Y, W, and G and test the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlD₄ is known to react violently with water and similar protic solvents.\n    *   **Formation of gas W:** Clue 3 states that gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD. The gas is HD (Hydrogen Deuteride). Let's check its composition: Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. So, Y is not H₂O.\n        *   What if liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)? The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n        *   Let's check the gas W = D₂ (Deuterium gas). Composition: Protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Neutrons = 1 + 1 = 2. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **Formation of precipitate G:** In this reaction, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so it's certain that Al(OD)₃ would be a precipitate as well. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Clue 9: The reaction with a keto acid.**\n    A keto acid has both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols (hydroxyl groups, -OH).\n    *   Ketone reduction: R-CO-R' → R-CD(OH)-R'\n    *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n    The final product would be a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups), for example, HO-CD₂-R'-CD(OH)-R. This molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminium. The mass number of the most stable isotope of aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Sum of the two cumulative masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances involved.**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W.** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): D is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely to be formed in the context of the other clues)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O). (Fits)\n\n    *   **Clue 2: The reaction.** \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". The release of D₂ gas strongly suggests a reaction between a deuterated reducing agent (a metal deuteride) and a proton/deuteron source like water or heavy water.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Substance B.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance G.** Since heating the precipitate G releases D₂O (B), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (the deuterated analog of a metal hydroxide), which decomposes upon heating. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n2.  **Propose a candidate for Substance X.**\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The organic chemistry context.** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and its analog, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), are extremely common and powerful reducing agents. NaBD₄/NaBH₄ is another pair.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is famous for reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). A keto acid contains both functional groups. The reduction of a keto acid (like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) with LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) followed by workup yields a diol (like 1,2-propanediol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X. The reaction would be with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. (Checks out)\n    *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   The organic chemistry reaction with a keto acid makes sense. (Checks out)\n\n    All clues point strongly to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" implies we sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements within the molecule's formula. We will use the integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Mass from lightest element) + (Mass from heaviest element)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substances X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze common gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   Other gases like N₂ (14p, 14n), O₂ (16p, 16n), CO (14p, 14n) also fit this criterion, but the clue about a \"heavier isotope\" strongly points towards Deuterium (D). So, we can hypothesize **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Substance X and Reaction:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" which we now suspect is Deuterium (D). It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen (or its isotope) is the reaction of a hydride with water.\n        *   The phrase \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n        *   The \"close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n        *   To produce pure D₂ gas from LiAlD₄, the other reactant (liquid Y) must also be a source of deuterium atoms. The most common liquid that fits this is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O. It produces D₂ gas (W). So, we can tentatively identify **Y = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces a precipitate G. In the products `LiOD + Al(OD)₃`, LiOD is soluble, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, is insoluble, just like its analog Al(OH)₃.\n        *   G (Al(OD)₃) is heated and releases B. When Al(OH)₃ is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OH)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`.\n        *   By analogy, `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So, substance **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   The problem states the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The actual melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong confirmation of our identifications.\n\n    *   **Confirmation with the Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) -> Secondary alcohol (>CHOH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains a total of 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly and rules out milder reagents like NaBD₄ (which wouldn't reduce the carboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X.**\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently conclude that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number and mass): Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number and mass): Aluminium (Al).\n\n    *   **Interpret the Calculation Instructions:** The question includes a critical clause: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This clause tells us how to calculate the mass contribution for each element.\n        *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are **four instances** in the formula LiAlD₄. Therefore, we must sum the masses of all four Deuterium atoms.\n        *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is only **one instance**.\n\n    *   **Calculate:** We will use integer mass numbers, as the options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the main isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (mass of a D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × (mass of an Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards elements like hydrogen (Deuterium, D), carbon (¹³C), etc.\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** A violent reaction with a liquid (often water) is characteristic of highly reactive hydrides or similar compounds.\n    *   **Clue 5 & 6: G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O**, confirming that the heavy isotope from Clue 1 is Deuterium (D).\n    *   If heating G produces D₂O, then G must be a deuterated hydrate or a compound that decomposes to yield D₂O, like a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 3 Revisited: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze some potential gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1) (Yes)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7) (Yes)\n        *   C₂H₄: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (Yes)\n        Given that Deuterium is central to the problem, **W = D₂** is the most plausible candidate.\n    *   **Clue 8: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This strongly suggests common laboratory reagents, very likely reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 7: The reaction product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. Powerful reducing agents like LiAlH₄ reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reaction `R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent]` yields a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`. This product molecule contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction with Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. If we assume Y is D₂O (heavy water) to produce D₂ gas, the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes decomposition into the metal oxide and water. So, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **B = D₂O**, which matches our finding from its melting point.\n    *   All clues fit perfectly with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   (Alternative check: If X were NaBD₄, the reaction `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O -> NaBO₂ + 4D₂` produces the right gas (D₂) but Sodium Metaborate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate G would form. This rules out NaBD₄).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the **cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)**. We should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z) or atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the molecule:** The formula is LiAlD₄.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is **one** atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The Melting Point of B**\n    The substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is Deuterium (²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: Formation of B from G**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` might decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1, 2, and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since D₂O is a product down the line, this heavier isotope is almost certainly **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   This reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's analyze potential gases (W). Given that Deuterium is involved, let's check hydrogen isotopes:\n        *   H₂ (normal hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n        *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n        *   **D₂ (dideuterium)**: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly!)\n    *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, both reactants should ideally be rich in Deuterium. So, X is a deuterated compound, and Y is likely D₂O. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   We are looking for a common deuterated organic reagent that reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)- and -COOH groups, for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms) is reduced by X to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups (e.g., R-C(=O)-R'-COOH → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), which has two -OH groups, hence 2 oxygens).\n    *   Common reducing agents are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. NaBH₄ is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride) is a very powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. Its analog is **LiAlD₄ (lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Heavy isotope:** Yes, it contains Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Organic reagent:** Yes, LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent, and LiAlD₄ is its well-known analog used for isotopic labeling.\n        *   **Reaction with Y = D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. The same applies to LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide), which is insoluble and forms a precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reduction:** LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, changing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. This fits.\n\n    All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1, present as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄. We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We use integer atomic mass numbers for this calculation, as is standard for such problems and suggested by the integer options.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**.\n    *   The molecule LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum). Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass of D) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This is a strong clue that we are dealing with deuterium. Normal water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0 °C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine possible diatomic gases related to the context:\n    *   H₂ (molecular hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (molecular deuterium): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (p = n).\n    This confirms that the gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, both the reagent (X) and the protic solvent it reacts with (Y) must contain only deuterium, not protium (normal hydrogen). Therefore, liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O). Substance X must be a deuterated reagent. The problem mentions X and its analog are used in organic chemistry and that the reaction is violent. This points towards a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The two most common are Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n4.  **Differentiate between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄:** The reaction between X and Y (D₂O) forms a precipitate G. Let's write the reactions:\n    *   `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    *   `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    Sodium borate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate forms. However, aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will precipitate. This means G is Al(OD)₃, and **Substance X must be LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify with other clues:**\n    *   **Heating G:** The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃. When heated, metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose. `2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g)`. This releases substance B, which we identified as D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   **Keto acid reaction:** The problem states \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It can reduce both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A typical α-keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH (containing 3 oxygen atoms). LiAlD₄ would reduce it to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This is also consistent.\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must sum the mass of the single Aluminium atom and the four Deuterium atoms in the LiAlD₄ molecule.\n    *   Since the answer options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The isotope Deuterium is ²H, with a mass number of 2.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and Liquid Y.**\n    The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n    Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This means G is a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide that loses D₂O upon heating.\n    The overall reaction involves Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and gas W. Since the products (G and B) contain deuterium (D), the liquid reactant Y must be the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\n    Gas W is released from the reaction of X and Y (D₂O). The clue is that a molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze possible gases from a reaction involving a deuteride and D₂O.\n    The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. The isotopes could be H or D.\n    *   H₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per H), 0 neutrons. Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    *   D₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Protons = Neutrons.** This fits the description.\n    *   HD molecule: 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    Therefore, **Gas W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Substance X and Precipitate G.**\n    We know that X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G.\n    X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)\n    The clue \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The \"heavier isotope\" version would be Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    Let's test X = LiAlD₄.\n    The reaction with D₂O is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃, is the precipitate G**. This is consistent because aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O, releasing D₂O (Substance B), which matches our deductions.\n    If we tested X = NaBD₄, the products would be NaOD and B(OD)₃. Boric acid and its deuterated analog are soluble in water, so no precipitate would form. Thus, X cannot be NaBD₄.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the identity of X with the final clue.**\n    The clue states: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups to alcohols (or deuterated alcohols, \"deuterols\").\n    R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (workup) → R-CH(OD)-CD₂(OD)\n    The final product is a diol (an alcohol with two hydroxyl groups, or in this case, deuteroxyl groups). It contains **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\n    The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must account for all atoms of hydrogen and aluminum in the formula.\n    *   We use integer atomic masses for the calculation, as the options are integers. Mass(Deuterium, D) = 2 amu. Mass(Aluminum, ²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × Mass(Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Final Calculation:** The cumulative sum is the sum of these two values.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B's melting point is ~277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: The heavy isotope is Deuterium (D).** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 4: Analysis of the reaction.**\n        *   Substance X (containing D) reacts violently with liquid Y.\n        *   A precipitate G is formed.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O). This implies G is a compound that can be dehydrated (or \"de-deuterated\"), such as a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal deuteroxide M(OD)ₓ when heated would yield a metal oxide and D₂O.\n        *   For G to be a metal deuteroxide, liquid Y must be the source of the OD group, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   A gas W is released, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider the reaction between a metal deuteride (a plausible form for X) and heavy water (Y). For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Let's check the gas **W = D₂**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   So far, we know X is a substance containing a metal and deuterium. The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   **Clue 5: X or its analog is a reagent in organic chemistry.** The most common hydride reagents (whose deuterated analogs are also used) are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test these candidates:\n        *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. However, both sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid (B(OD)₃) are soluble in water. No precipitate (G) would form. This contradicts the clues.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate**. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 6: Heating G releases B.** If G is Al(OD)₃, heating it would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (B), which also matches the clues.\n    *   **Clue 7: The keto acid reaction.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) and its analog LiAlH₄ are powerful reducing agents that would reduce both functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This final clue confirms our identification.\n\n3.  **Conclusion: Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass from aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated above.\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), but heavy water (D₂O) melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\". Since we've identified B as D₂O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen. Therefore, **Substance X must contain Deuterium**.\n    *   **Clue 5 & G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\". Heating metal hydroxides (M(OH)ₙ) typically yields a metal oxide and water (H₂O). By analogy, heating a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ) would yield a metal oxide and heavy water (D₂O). So, **G must be a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   **Clue 3 & W:** \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium, let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. Thus, **W is very likely D₂ gas**.\n    *   **Clue 2, 8, 9 & X:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry, and it reacts with a keto acid. These properties strongly point towards powerful reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Since X contains deuterium, the candidates are their deuterated analogs: lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBD₄).\n    *   **The Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a suitable liquid Y that would produce the identified products. The most logical reaction to produce D₂ gas is the reaction of the deuteride with heavy water (D₂O), which would also be the source for the deuteroxide precipitate.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Validation of the Reaction:**\n        *   This reaction is known to be extremely violent. (Matches clue 2)\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble), aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate), and deuterium gas (D₂). This matches the formation of precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃** and gas **W = D₂**.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces **B = D₂O**.\n        *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry. (Matches clue 9)\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) would reduce the keto group to a deuterated alcohol (R-CD(OH)-COOH). The product contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), meaning it has 2 oxygen atoms. (Matches clue 8)\n\n    *   Based on all the clues, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H). Its isotope in the molecule is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2. There are four D atoms in the formula.\n    *   The term \"cumulative atomic masses\" and \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" means we need to sum the mass of the single Al atom and the four D atoms.\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the calculation: Sum = 27 + (4 × 2)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n*   **Identify Gas W and Substance B:**\n    1.  The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze common diatomic gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, a heavier isotope of hydrogen): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit.\n    2.  This suggests that Substance X contains deuterium (D).\n    3.  Substance B has a melting point of approximately 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    1.  Substance G releases D₂O (B) when heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydroxide (like M(OD)x) or a deuterated hydrate.\n    2.  Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas D₂ and a precipitate G. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Given the presence of deuterium everywhere, it is logical to assume the reaction is between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    3.  Reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G, precipitate) + D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    4.  So, **Y is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue to Identify X:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol (`-COOH` -> `-CH₂OH`).\n        *   Therefore, X must be a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The most common reagents for this are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), with LiAlH₄ being much stronger and necessary for reducing carboxylic acids.\n    3.  The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (Deuterium), **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verify the Reaction with LiAlD₄:**\n    1.  Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    2.  This reaction is known to be violent.\n    3.  It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    4.  It produces a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    5.  When G is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    6.  All clues fit perfectly.\n\n*   **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    1.  Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    2.  The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    3.  The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    4.  The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    5.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass is 27 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). Each has a mass of approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    6.  Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical properties and reactions described, we can deduce the identities of the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". The reaction involves a deuterated compound (implied by the presence of D₂O). Let's examine possible hydrogen-based gases:\n    *   H₂: Contains 2 protons (1 from each H) and 0 neutrons. Does not match.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Contains 2 protons (1 from each D) and 2 neutrons (1 from each D). This matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance Y:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂. For D₂ to be produced, the reaction likely involves two sources of deuterium. Since Substance X is a deuterated compound and B is D₂O, the most plausible identity for the liquid reactant Y is also **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Identification of Substance X:** We are looking for a deuterated compound that is a common organic reagent, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (G). Let's test Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (Substance G).\n    *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a molecule with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium, D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (present as 1 atom of Al).\n    *   We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D has a mass number of 2; the common isotope of Al has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The nature of substance B.**\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. However, it is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify **B as D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of gas W.**\n    *   \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Since the system clearly involves deuterium (from the identification of D₂O), let's examine hydrogen and its isotopes as components of the gas.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each ¹H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n    *   HD (Protium-Deuterium): ¹H has (1p, 0n), ²H has (1p, 1n). HD molecule has 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each ²H has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has **2 protons, 2 neutrons**. (This fits the condition).\n    *   While other gases like ¹⁴N₂ (14p, 14n) or ¹²C¹⁶O (14p, 14n) also fit this numerical criterion, the presence of D₂O elsewhere in the reaction system makes D₂ the most chemically consistent candidate for gas W.\n    *   So, we identify **W as D₂ (di-deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify G, X, and Y.**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W (D₂) + Precipitate G.\n    *   Also, heating G releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2M(OD)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The fact that a precipitate forms suggests a metal hydroxide that is insoluble, such as Al(OH)₃ or Mg(OH)₂.\n    *   Let's consider **G = Al(OD)₃** (aluminum deuteroxide), as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Heating it would give: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   Now, we can assemble the reaction: X must contain Al and D. The reaction produces D₂ gas and a precipitate of Al(OD)₃ after reacting with liquid Y. To provide the oxygen and the extra deuterium for the products, Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The full reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + Al(OD)₃ + [soluble byproduct].\n    *   Let's look at Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"close analog\" incorporating a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) is **Lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n        **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD**\n    *   This is a known violent reaction. All components match our deductions:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄ (contains heavier isotope D).\n        *   Y = D₂O (liquid).\n        *   W = D₂ (gas with equal protons and neutrons).\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (precipitate). Heating gives D₂O.\n        *   B = D₂O.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Final Clue (Clue 7).**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". This means we sum the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements in one molecule of X.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **4** atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **1** atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Liquid Y**\n- The problem states that a gas W is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n- Let's analyze some simple molecules:\n    - H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n    - **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Equal)\n    - He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Equal, but a noble gas, unlikely to be a product of a violent reaction).\n    - **HF (Hydrogen Fluoride):** H (1p, 0n) + F-19 (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Equal)\n- The problem also states that a precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C or 276.97 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n- If the reaction releases D₂O, it's highly likely that deuterated compounds are involved. Specifically, if B is D₂O, the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly D₂O as well, which acts as the solvent and reactant.\n- If Y is D₂O, and the reaction is with substance X, the gas released (W) must be D₂. The reaction cannot produce HF if there is no Fluorine source. This confirms W = D₂, and the reaction involves deuterium transfer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X**\n- Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n- The prompt says, \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards deuterated versions of common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), or simpler hydrides like Lithium Hydride (LiH). The \"analog\" would be the standard hydrogen version.\n- The next clue is: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    - A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-(...)-COOH. It contains at least three oxygen atoms.\n    - To get a product with only two oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced.\n    - LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids (to alcohols). The product of reducing a keto acid would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-(...)-CH₂OH, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    - NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be R-CH(OH)-(...)-COOH, which still has three oxygen atoms.\n- Therefore, the analog of X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄. This means substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify LiAlD₄ with all clues**\n- **Formula:** LiAlD₄\n- **Heavier isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of Hydrogen. ✓\n- **Organic reagent analog:** The analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and important reagent. ✓\n- **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. This reaction is violent, similar to LiAlH₄ with water. ✓\n- **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. ✓\n- **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. ✓\n- **G releases B on heating:** Heating aluminum hydroxide dehydrates it (`2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O. So B = D₂O. ✓\n- **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. ✓\n- All clues perfectly match the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n- The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n- **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n- The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n- **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number Z).\n- **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number Z).\n- **Mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen is present as 4 atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    - Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n- **Mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** In LiAlD₄, there is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    - Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n- **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    - Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
