    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means that the potential has the same form in all directions, as it only depends on the radial distance $r$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates. The total Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{di^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n    Since the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension, the energy eigenvalues for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then determined by $N$:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$. We list the first few levels to identify the third excited state:\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest possible energy level. $N=0$.\n        Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level. $N=1$.\n        Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$.\n        Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$.\n        Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is **(9/2)ħω**.\n\n4.  **Find the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. For the third excited state ($N=3$), we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives **3** states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives **6** states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This gives **1** state.\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) for $N=3$ is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_N$ for an energy level $N$ in a $d$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula for combinations with repetition:\n    $g_N = \\binom{N+d-1}{d-1}$\n    In our case, $N=3$ and the dimension $d=3$.\n    $g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n    Therefore, there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\n    B) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$\n    C) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\n    D) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$\n\n    Option A matches our calculated results.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **System Identification:** Correctly identifying the potential as a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is the first crucial step. The energy expressions in options B and D are for a particle in a spherical box, a different system.\n*   **Definition of \"Excited State\":** The ground state is $N=0$. The *n*-th excited state corresponds to the quantum number $N=n$. So the third excited state is $N=3$, not $n_x=3$ or something similar.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** Be systematic when counting the combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to avoid missing any or double-counting. Using the combinatorial formula is a safer and faster method. The degeneracy 3 corresponds to the first excited state ($N=1$), which is a common point of confusion.\n\nFinal Answer based on the step-by-step analysis is that the energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
