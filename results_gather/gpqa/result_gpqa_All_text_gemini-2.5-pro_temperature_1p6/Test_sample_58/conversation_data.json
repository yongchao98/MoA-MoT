    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the components and their nature:**\n    *   CH3COOH (Acetic Acid): A weak acid.\n    *   HCl (Hydrochloric Acid): A strong acid, which dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.\n    *   Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide): A strong base, which dissociates completely into Ba(2+) and 2 OH-.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n    *   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, moles of H+ = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n    *   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n        *   **Crucial Point:** Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n        *   Moles of OH- = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2 × (2 mol OH- / 1 mol Ba(OH)2) = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n3.  **Determine the total moles of acid and base.**\n    *   Total moles of acid = moles of H+ (from HCl) + moles of CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol of acid**\n    *   Total moles of base = moles of OH- = **0.180 mol of base**\n\n4.  **Perform the neutralization reaction.**\n    The strong base (OH-) will react with all the available acid until one is consumed.\n    *   The moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n    *   Calculate the moles of excess OH-:\n        *   Moles of excess OH- = Total moles of OH- - Total moles of acid\n        *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n    *   **Careful Point:** The strong base neutralizes the strong acid first, and then the weak acid. Since we are simply calculating the excess base, we can combine the acids. After the reaction, all the HCl and CH3COOH have been consumed, leaving an excess of strong base (OH-) and the conjugate base of the weak acid (CH3COO-). The pH of the solution will be primarily determined by the concentration of the excess strong base, as its contribution to the [OH-] is much larger than that from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base CH3COO-.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH- ions.**\n    *   First, calculate the total volume of the mixed solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   Now, calculate the final concentration of OH-:\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n6.  **Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n        *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   Calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Total acid moles = (0.5 L * 0.1 M) + (0.4 L * 0.2 M) = 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 mol\n*   Total base moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 M * 2 = 0.18 mol\n*   Excess base moles = 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol\n*   Total volume = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L\n*   Final [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n*   pOH = -log(0.04167) = 1.38\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n<<<A>>>"
