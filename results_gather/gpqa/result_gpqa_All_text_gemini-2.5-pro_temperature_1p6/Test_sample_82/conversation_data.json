    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Initial Dilution:** The first step is a dilution. The initial 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted by adding an equal volume of water. The concentration for the titration calculation will be half of the original.\n2.  **Titration Reaction:** This is a weak acid (CH₃COOH) being titrated by a strong base (NaOH). The products are water and the conjugate base of the weak acid (sodium acetate, CH₃COONa).\n3.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region, where both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) are present in significant amounts. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool here.\n4.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** At this point, all the weak acid has been neutralized and converted into its conjugate base. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base (CH₃COO⁻) in water. The pH will be greater than 7.\n5.  **Volume Changes:** Remember that adding the titrant (NaOH) increases the total volume of the solution, which affects the concentrations of the species involved, especially at the equivalence point.\n6.  **Constants:** We are given Ka for acetic acid. For calculations at the equivalence point, we will need Kb for its conjugate base, acetate. We can find this using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid, V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid, M₁ = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume, V₂ = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new concentration (M₂) is found using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n*   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n    *   This is the starting concentration of acetic acid for the titration.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.**\n\n*   Moles = Concentration × Volume (in Liters)\n*   Volume of diluted acid = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = **0.00100 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration.**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 0.25 × 0.00100 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 0.75 × 0.00100 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   We now have a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.7328\n*   Now, plug the values into the equation. Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n    *   pH = 4.7328 + log (0.00025 mol / 0.00075 mol)\n    *   pH = 4.7328 + log (1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.7328 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771\n    *   pH ≈ **4.26**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point.**\n\n*   First, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. At this point, moles of NaOH added = initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point.\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   At the equivalence point, all 0.00100 mol of CH₃COOH has been converted to 0.00100 mol of its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻. Calculate its concentration.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.020 M**\n*   This conjugate base hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for CH₃COO⁻.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find [OH⁻].\n    |             | CH₃COO⁻   | CH₃COOH | OH⁻    |\n    |-------------|-----------|---------|--------|\n    | Initial (I) | 0.020 M   | 0       | ~0     |\n    | Change (C)  | -x        | +x      | +x     |\n    | Equil. (E)  | 0.020 - x | x       | x      |\n*   Use the Kb expression:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.020.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.020\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   So, [OH⁻] = x = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M. The assumption was valid.\n*   Calculate pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Calculate pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
