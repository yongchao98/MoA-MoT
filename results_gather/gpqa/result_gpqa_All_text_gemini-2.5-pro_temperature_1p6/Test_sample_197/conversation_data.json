    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all species containing cobalt in the solution.\n\n**2. List All Cobalt-Containing Species:**\nIn a solution of `Co^2+` and `SCN^-`, the following cobalt-containing species can exist:\n*   Free cobalt(II) ion: `Co^2+`\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n**3. Define Total Cobalt Concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)` or `[Co]total`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`[Co]total = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n**4. Use the Overall Stability Constants (β):**\nThe overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN^-]`):\n*   For `[Co(SCN)]^+`: `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])` => `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1[Co^2+][SCN^-]`\n*   For `[Co(SCN)2]`: `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)` => `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2`\n*   For `[Co(SCN)3]^-`: `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)` => `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3`\n*   For `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`: `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)` => `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\n**5. Express Total Cobalt Concentration in Terms of `[Co^2+]`:**\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`[Co]total = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\nFactor out the common term `[Co^2+]`:\n`[Co]total = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**6. Define the Mole Fraction (α):**\nThe percentage of a specific complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This is based on the mole fraction, `α`, of that species. We are looking for the percentage of `[Co(SCN)2]`, which corresponds to its mole fraction `α2`.\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / [Co]total`\nPercentage = `α2 * 100%`\n\n**7. Derive the Formula for `α2`:**\nSubstitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `[Co]total` into the `α2` formula:\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**8. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate:**\nGiven values:\n*   `[SCN^-]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β1` = 9\n*   `β2` = 40\n*   `β3` = 63\n*   `β4` = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the value of each term in the formula:\n*   Numerator: `β2[SCN^-]^2` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   1\n    *   `β1[SCN^-]` = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   `β2[SCN^-]^2` = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   `β3[SCN^-]^3` = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   `β4[SCN^-]^4` = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the sum of the denominator:\nDenominator Sum = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nFinally, calculate `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**9. Convert to Percentage:**\nPercentage of `[Co(SCN)2]` = `α2 * 100%` = `0.16916 * 100%` = `16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fraction vs. Percentage:** The question asks for the percentage, so the final calculated fraction (`α2`) must be multiplied by 100.\n2.  **Meaning of `[SCN^-]`:** The problem states `[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M`. In such problems, this is typically assumed to be the *equilibrium concentration* of the free ligand, not the total amount added.\n3.  **Role of `c(Co)`:** The total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10^-2 M`) is not required to calculate the relative percentage (or mole fraction) of the complexes, as the free `[Co^2+]` term cancels out during the derivation.\n4.  **`β0` Term:** The term `1` in the denominator of the mole fraction formula represents the free `Co^2+` ion. It corresponds to an effective `β0 = 1`. This term must not be forgotten.\n5.  **Blue Color:** The problem mentions that the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is blue. This is extra information to identify the target species, as the blue `[CoCl4]^2-` and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-` complexes are well-known, but here it's stated that `[Co(SCN)2]` is the blue one. The core of the problem is the mathematical calculation, not the color chemistry itself.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Target: `% of [Co(SCN)2]`\n*   Formula: `% = 100 * (β2[L]²) / (1 + β1[L] + β2[L]² + β3[L]³ + β4[L]⁴)`, where `L = [SCN^-]`\n*   Calculation: `% = 100 * (40 * 0.1²) / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.1² + 63*0.1³ + 16*0.1⁴)`\n*   `% = 100 * (0.4) / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016)`\n*   `% = 100 * 0.4 / 2.3646`\n*   `% = 40 / 2.3646 ≈ 16.916%`\n*   Comparing with the options, 16.9% matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
