    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **1. Understanding the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2, they are fermions.\n*   **Key Principle for Fermions:** Identical fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum State:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for 'spin up' or -1/2 for 'spin down').\n*   **Consequence of Pauli Principle:** For any given energy level `E_n` (defined by `n`), there are two possible spin states (up and down). Therefore, a maximum of two fermions can occupy the same energy level `n`, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`.\n*   **Energy Levels for a Single Particle:** The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. So, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\n    *   `E₁ = 1²E = E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n*   **Total System Energy:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles, assuming they are non-interacting.\n\n### **2. Calculating the State Energies**\n\nWe will now determine the configuration of the four particles for the ground state and the first two excited states by filling the available single-particle energy levels.\n\n#### **Step 1: Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   The lowest energy level is `n=1`. We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The next lowest energy level is `n=2`. We can place the remaining two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   Two particles in the `n=1` state.\n*   Two particles in the `n=2` state.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of these four particles:\n`E_gs = 2 * E₁ + 2 * E₂`\n`E_gs = 2 * (E) + 2 * (4E)`\n`E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### **Step 2: First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we must find the lowest-energy way to promote a particle from the ground state configuration to a higher, unoccupied energy level. The lowest energy transition involves moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   Ground state configuration has `n=1` and `n=2` levels filled.\n*   Highest occupied level is `n=2`.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n\nWe promote one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level. The new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in the `n=1` state.\n*   One particle in the `n=2` state.\n*   One particle in the `n=3` state.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₃`\n`E_1st = 2 * (E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (9E)`\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### **Step 3: Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\nLet's list the possible single-particle promotions from the ground state `{2 in n=1, 2 in n=2}`:\n1.  **Promotion from n=2 to n=3:** (This was the first excited state)\n    *   Energy = 15E.\n\n2.  **Promotion from n=1 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy = `1 * E₁ + 2 * E₂ + 1 * E₃`\n    *   Total Energy = `1 * (E) + 2 * (4E) + 1 * (9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n\n3.  **Promotion from n=2 to n=4:**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n    *   Total Energy = `2 * E₁ + 1 * E₂ + 1 * E₄`\n    *   Total Energy = `2 * (E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`\n\nWe also need to consider promoting two particles. The lowest energy two-particle promotion from the ground state would be moving both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n*   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n*   Total Energy = `2 * E₁ + 2 * E₃ = 2 * E + 2 * 9E = 20E`\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we found: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E.\n*   The ground state energy is 10E.\n*   The first excited state energy is the lowest one, which is 15E.\n*   The second excited state energy is the next lowest, which is 18E.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
