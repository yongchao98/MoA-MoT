    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A * σ * T^4$\n    where A is the surface area of the star ($A = 4πR^2$), R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n    Substituting the area, the formula becomes:\n    $L = 4πR^2σT^4$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the formula from Step 2, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars as:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4πR_1^2σT_1^4) / (4πR_2^2σT_2^4)$\n    The constants $4π$ and $σ$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$  or  $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$\n    Substituting this into our ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The information about the mass ($M_1 = 1.5 * M_2$) is extra information not needed for this specific calculation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. It is a potential distractor.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2):**\n    *   We are not given the temperatures directly, but we are given information about the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest. This is related to temperature by **Wien's Displacement Law**:\n        $λ_{em,max} = b / T$\n        where $λ_{em,max}$ is the wavelength of peak emission in the star's own rest frame, and b is Wien's constant. This can be rearranged to find the temperature: $T = b / λ_{em,max}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The problem states that the *observed* wavelengths of maximum brightness are the same ($λ_{obs,max,1} = λ_{obs,max,2}$). We must account for the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s. Therefore, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength:\n        $λ_{obs,max,1} = λ_{em,max,1}$\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. This non-zero velocity causes a relativistic Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:\n        $λ_{obs} = λ_{em} * √((1+β)/(1-β))$\n        where $β = v/c$ (the ratio of the star's velocity to the speed of light). A positive velocity typically means the object is moving away, causing a redshift (increase in wavelength).\n    *   Since $λ_{obs,max,1} = λ_{obs,max,2}$, we have:\n        $λ_{em,max,1} = λ_{em,max,2} * √((1+β_2)/(1-β_2))$\n    *   Now, we substitute Wien's Law ($λ_{em,max} = b/T$) into this equation:\n        $b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * √((1+β_2)/(1-β_2))$\n    *   The constant 'b' cancels out. We can now solve for the temperature ratio $T_1 / T_2$:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / √((1+β_2)/(1-β_2)) = √((1-β_2)/(1+β_2))$\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of β for Star_2:**\n    *   $v_2 = 700$ km/s = $700,000$ m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) ≈ $3 * 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $β_2 = v_2 / c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333$\n\n7.  **Substitute and Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   We now substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation from Step 4:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (√((1-β_2)/(1+β_2)))^4$\n    *   The square root and the 4th power simplify:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1-β_2)/(1+β_2))^2$\n    *   Now, plug in the value for $β_2$:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333))^2$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (0.997667 / 1.002333)^2$\n        $L_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.25 * (0.995344)^2$\n        $L_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99071$\n        $L_1 / L_2 ≈ 2.2291$\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 2.2291.\n    A) ~2.25\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.32\n    The value ~2.23 is the closest match to our calculated result. The small difference is due to rounding.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final step is to combine all the pieces. The luminosity ratio depends on the radius ratio squared and the temperature ratio to the fourth power. The radius effect increases the luminosity ratio by a factor of $1.5^2 = 2.25$. The temperature effect, caused by the relativistic Doppler shift of Star_2, makes Star_2 slightly hotter than Star_1 to produce the same observed peak wavelength. This temperature difference slightly decreases the overall luminosity ratio to a value just below 2.25. The detailed calculation confirms this.\n\n$L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 * ((1-β_2)/(1+β_2))^2 ≈ 2.23$\n\n<<<C>>>"
