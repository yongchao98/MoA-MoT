    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle has spin 1/2. Its magnetic moment is given by the operator `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γ(S · ẑ)B = -γBS_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate. The energy eigenvalues of `H_initial` are determined by the eigenvalues of `S_z`, which are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energies are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state along the z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field in the z-direction is turned off, and a new magnetic field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on along the `+y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -γ(S · ŷ)B = -γBS_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting `H` and `|ψ(0)>`, we get: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`.\n    *   To see how this state evolves, it's easiest to express the initial state `|+z>` in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian `H`, which is the eigenbasis of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_y`, denoted as `|+y>` and `|-y>`, are related to the z-basis states by:\n        *   `|+y> = (1/√2) (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y> = (1/√2) (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   By inverting these relations, we can express `|+z>` in the y-basis:\n        *   `|+z> = (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   So, the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Evolved State:**\n    *   Now we apply the time evolution operator. `S_y` acts on its eigenstates as `S_y |±y> = ±(ħ/2) |±y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) [ (1/√2) (|+y> + |-y>) ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+y> + e^(iγBtS_y/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates, `e^(iγBtS_y/ħ)|±y> = e^(iγBt(±ħ/2)/ħ)|±y> = e^(±iγBt/2)|±y>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. Let's calculate `<S_z>(t)`.\n    *   It is convenient to switch `|ψ(t)>` back to the z-basis. Let `ω = γB`.\n        *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) [ e^(iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iωt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n        *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ (e^(iωt/2) + e^(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iωt/2) - e^(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n    *   Using Euler's formulas (`2cos(θ) = e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ)` and `2isin(θ) = e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ)`):\n        *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) [ 2cos(ωt/2)|+z> + i(2isin(ωt/2))|-z> ]`\n        *   `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we compute the expectation value `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n        *   `S_z|ψ(t)> = S_z(cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>) = cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n        *   `S_z|ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    *   The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`.\n    *   `<S_z>(t) = (cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2) [cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    *   Due to orthogonality (`<+z|-z> = 0`), only the diagonal terms survive:\n        *   `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) [cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        *   `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`.\n    *   The time dependence is described by the `cos(ωt)` term. This is a sinusoidal oscillation.\n    *   The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    *   From our definition in Step 5, we have `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and `ω` is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Initial State:** The term \"aligned with\" a magnetic field implies the system is in the lowest energy eigenstate. For a particle with `μ=γS` and positive `γ`, this is the spin-up state in the direction of the field.\n*   **Hamiltonian:** The potential energy of a magnetic dipole `μ` in a field `B` is correctly given by `H = -μ·B`.\n*   **Time Evolution Operator:** The operator is `U(t) = e^(-iHt/ħ)`. A sign error here can change the direction of precession but not the frequency.\n*   **Basis Change:** Changing between the `z`-basis and the `y`-basis for spin-1/2 states must be done carefully. The complex number `i` is crucial.\n*   **Trigonometric Identities:** Correct application of Euler's formula and double-angle identities is key to simplifying the final expression.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment, `<μ_z>(t)`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
