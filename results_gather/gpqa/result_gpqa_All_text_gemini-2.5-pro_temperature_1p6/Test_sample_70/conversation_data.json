    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq_4 / T_eq_2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is established when the energy it absorbs from its star equals the energy it radiates into space.\n    *   Energy absorbed is proportional to the stellar flux, which decreases with the square of the distance (d) from the star. So, Energy_Absorbed ∝ 1/d².\n    *   Energy radiated is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. So, Energy_Radiated ∝ T_eq⁴.\n    *   At equilibrium, Energy_Absorbed = Energy_Radiated.\n    *   Therefore, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/d².\n    *   By taking the fourth root of both sides, we find the relationship between temperature and distance: T_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/√d.\n    *   To find the ratio of temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can write:\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (1/√d_4) / (1/√d_2) = √(d_2 / d_4).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (or semi-major axis, 'a'). Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the same as the orbital distance (d).\n    *   The law states that for planets orbiting the same star, P² is proportional to d³. This can be written as P²/d³ = constant.\n    *   Applying this to Planet_2 and Planet_4: P₂²/d₂³ = P₄²/d₄³.\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of their distances:\n        d₂³/d₄³ = P₂²/P₄²\n        (d₂/d₄)³ = (P₂/P₄)²\n        d₂/d₄ = (P₂/P₄)^(2/3).\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships to Link Temperature and Period:**\n    *   We now have two key relationships:\n        1. T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = √(d₂ / d₄)\n        2. d₂/d₄ = (P₂/P₄)^(2/3)\n    *   Substitute the second equation into the first:\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = √[(P₂/P₄)^(2/3)]\n    *   Simplifying the exponent:\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P₂/P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P₂/P₄)^(1/3).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods: P₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n        P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n    *   To make the calculation easier, convert the decimal to a fraction: 3.5 = 7/2.\n        P₂ / P₄ = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7.\n    *   Now, substitute this value into our final combined equation:\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (4/7)^(1/3).\n    *   Let's calculate the value:\n        4/7 ≈ 0.5714\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n        T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 ≈ 0.8298...\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately 0.83.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Same Star:** It is crucial that all planets orbit the same star for Kepler's Third Law and the temperature ratio to be applied in this way. The problem implies this by describing them as a single \"system.\"\n*   **Same Albedo:** The problem states that the albedo is the same for all planets. This is important because the full equilibrium temperature formula includes an albedo term (1-A). Since A₂ = A₄, this term cancels out when taking the ratio.\n*   **Circular Orbits:** The assumption of circular orbits simplifies the problem by allowing us to use the orbital distance 'd' directly, instead of the more complex semi-major axis 'a' used for elliptical orbits.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** The question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq_4 / T_eq_2), not the other way around. This dictates the setup of the final ratio calculation.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
