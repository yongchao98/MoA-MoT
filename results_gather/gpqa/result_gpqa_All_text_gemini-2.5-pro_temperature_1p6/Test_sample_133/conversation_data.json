    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when specific volumes and concentrations of two strong acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) are mixed with a strong base (Ba(OH)₂).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Strong Acids and Bases:** All reactants (HCl, H₂SO₄, Ba(OH)₂) are strong electrolytes, meaning they dissociate completely in water.\n2.  **Stoichiometry of Ion Release:**\n    *   HCl is a monoprotic acid: 1 mole of HCl releases 1 mole of H⁺ ions.\n    *   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid: 1 mole of H₂SO₄ releases 2 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a dibasic base: 1 mole of Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 moles of OH⁻ ions.\n3.  **Core Reaction:** The fundamental reaction for neutralization is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l).\n4.  **Standard Enthalpy of Neutralization:** The heat released when one mole of water is formed from the reaction of a strong acid and a strong base is approximately constant, with a value of ΔH_neut ≈ -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.7 kcal/mol.\n5.  **Limiting Reactant:** The total amount of heat released depends on the number of moles of water formed, which is determined by the limiting reactant (either H⁺ or OH⁻).\n6.  **Units:** The final answer options are in both kcal and kJ. Careful unit conversion is necessary (1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ).\n7.  **Side Reaction (Precipitation):** The mixture contains Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions, which will form a precipitate (BaSO₄). This reaction also releases heat (enthalpy of precipitation). However, questions about \"enthalpy of neutralization\" often focus solely on the H⁺ + OH⁻ reaction. We should first calculate the heat from neutralization and see if it matches an option.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ ions.**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.100 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.100 mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total moles H⁺ = 0.100 mol + 0.180 mol = **0.280 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total moles of OH⁻ ions.**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.100 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.100 mol = **0.200 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the limiting reactant and moles of water formed.**\n*   The neutralization reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   We have 0.280 moles of H⁺ and 0.200 moles of OH⁻.\n*   Since the number of moles of OH⁻ (0.200) is less than the number of moles of H⁺ (0.280), **OH⁻ is the limiting reactant**.\n*   The number of moles of water formed will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant.\n*   Moles of H₂O formed = **0.200 mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization.**\n*   We use the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases, ΔH_neut ≈ -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   Enthalpy Change = Moles of H₂O formed × ΔH_neut\n*   Enthalpy Change = 0.200 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol)\n*   Enthalpy Change = **-2.74 kcal**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n*   A) -11.42 kcal: Incorrect. This value comes from multiplying 0.200 mol by -57.1 (the kJ value) but labeling it as kcal. (0.200 mol × -57.1 kJ/mol = -11.42 kJ)\n*   B) -16.0 kJ: Incorrect. Our calculated value is -11.42 kJ.\n*   C) -2.72 kcal: This is very close to our calculated value of -2.74 kcal. The minor difference arises from using a slightly different standard value for ΔH_neut (e.g., -13.6 kcal/mol gives -2.72 kcal exactly). This is the correct answer.\n*   D) -3.80 kcal: Incorrect. This would be the result if H⁺ were the limiting reactant.\n\nThe calculation confirms that the question expects only the enthalpy of neutralization, ignoring the enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO₄.\n\n<<<C>>>"
