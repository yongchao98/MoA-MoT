    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Experiment**\nThe primary objective is to create a recombinant protein in a mouse model. This protein is the mouse GADD45G protein with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag attached to its N-terminus. The purpose of the HA tag is to allow for easy detection and affinity purification of the GADD45G protein and its binding partners. Before creating the transgenic mouse, the construct is being tested in a cell line (Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Problem**\nThe experiment fails at the testing stage. The engineered construct, when transfected into CHO cells, does not lead to the overexpression of the desired fusion protein. The researcher has identified the DNA sequence of the construct as the source of the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence**\nThe sequence provided is the plus strand (also known as the coding strand) of the DNA construct. Translation machinery will effectively read this sequence (with T's replaced by U's in the mRNA) to synthesize the protein. The analysis must focus on translating this DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence to see if it matches the intended design.\n\n*   **Intended Design:** (HA Tag) - (GADD45G Protein)\n*   **HA Tag Sequence (amino acids):** YPYDVPDYA\n*   **DNA Sequence:**\n    5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC AAATGA CTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'\n\n**Step 4: Translate the 5' End of the DNA Sequence**\nWe will read the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides (codons) starting from the beginning.\n\n*   `ATG`: This is the universal start codon, which codes for **Methionine (M)**. All protein synthesis begins here.\n*   `TAC`: Codes for **Tyrosine (Y)**.\n*   `CCA`: Codes for **Proline (P)**.\n*   `TAC`: Codes for **Tyrosine (Y)**.\n*   `GAT`: Codes for **Aspartic Acid (D)**.\n*   `GTT`: Codes for **Valine (V)**.\n*   `CCA`: Codes for **Proline (P)**.\n*   `GAT`: Codes for **Aspartic Acid (D)**.\n*   `TAC`: Codes for **Tyrosine (Y)**.\n*   `GCC`: Codes for **Alanine (A)**.\n\nThe translated sequence so far is **M-YPYDVPDYA**. The `YPYDVPDYA` portion is the correct amino acid sequence for the HA tag. The initial Methionine is expected from the `ATG` start codon. So, the HA tag itself is encoded correctly.\n\n**Step 5: Continue Translating the Sequence Immediately After the Tag**\nLet's examine the codons that come directly after the sequence for the HA tag.\n\n*   The DNA sequence continues: `...TACGCC AAATGA...`\n*   `AAA`: Codes for **Lysine (K)**.\n*   `TGA`: This is a **Stop Codon**.\n\n**Step 6: Interpret the Finding**\nThe ribosome begins translation at the `ATG` start codon, correctly synthesizes the HA tag, adds one more amino acid (Lysine), and then encounters the `TGA` stop codon. Stop codons (UGA, UAA, UAG in mRNA) signal the termination of protein synthesis. The ribosome detaches, and the process ends. Consequently, instead of producing the full-length GADD45G fusion protein, the cell only produces a very short, non-functional peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K). This perfectly explains why the researcher is \"unable to overexpress [the] protein as expected.\"\n\n**Step 7: Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. As shown in Step 4, the DNA sequence correctly codes for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA).\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers are good practice, their absence does not guarantee proteolysis. More importantly, we have found a definitive reason for failure—a premature stop codon—which prevents the protein from being made in the first place. Proteolysis happens to a protein *after* it's been synthesized.\n*   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The presence of the `TGA` stop codon right after the HA tag sequence causes premature termination of translation, preventing the synthesis of the full GADD45G protein.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement has several flaws. First, the codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, the experiment is being tested in hamster (CHO) cells, not mouse cells. Third, and most critically, stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs; they are recognized by protein release factors that terminate translation. This statement is biologically incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only logical explanation for the experimental failure is the early termination of translation due to a premature stop codon in the construct's sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
