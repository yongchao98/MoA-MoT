    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in the energy (`ΔE`) of an electron, given its speed (`v`) and the uncertainty in its position (`Δx`). This problem connects concepts from quantum mechanics, specifically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, with the relationship between a particle's energy and momentum.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The core of the problem lies in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two relevant forms:\n    *   Position-Momentum: `Δx ⋅ Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2`\n    *   Energy-Time: `ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2`\n    Since we are given `Δx`, the position-momentum principle is the most direct starting point.\n\n2.  **Minimum Uncertainty:** The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty. The uncertainty principle provides a lower bound. To find this minimum value, we will use the equality:\n    `Δx ⋅ Δp_x = ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant (`ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 × 10^(-34) J·s`).\n\n3.  **Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty:** We can find the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp_x`) from the uncertainty in position (`Δx`). The main challenge is to then relate `Δp_x` to the uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`). The relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) is needed. For small uncertainties, we can use the approximation:\n    `ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) ⋅ Δp`\n\n4.  **Relativistic vs. Non-Relativistic:** The electron's speed is `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s`. Since `v` is a significant fraction of `c` (`v = (2/3)c`), we should ideally consider the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m₀c²)²`. However, a key insight is that the derivative `dE/dp` represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity `v`. This relationship `dE/dp = v` holds true for both non-relativistic (`E = p²/2m`) and relativistic cases. Therefore, we can directly state:\n    `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp_x`\n\n5.  **Units:** Ensure all units are in the standard SI system. The position uncertainty `Δx` is given in nanometers (nm) and must be converted to meters (m). `1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (`Δp_x`).**\nUsing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for minimum uncertainty:\n`Δp_x = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)`\n\nFirst, convert the uncertainty in position to SI units:\n`Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n\nNow, substitute the values for `ħ` and `Δx`:\n`ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n`Δp_x = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)`\n`Δp_x ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s`\n\n**Step 2: Relate the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp_x`) to the uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`).**\nAs established, the relationship between small uncertainties in energy and momentum is given by `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp_x`. We are given the velocity of the electron:\n`v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`).**\nSubstitute the values of `v` and `Δp_x` into the relation:\n`ΔE ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) × (0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)`\n`ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁸⁻²⁴ J`\n`ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J`\n\n**Step 4: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated value `ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J` is approximately `10⁻¹⁶ J`. This matches option A.\n\nA) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe final estimated minimum uncertainty in energy is ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<A>>>"
