    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity to calculate the relative speed between two objects and the total energy of the system.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Mass of the first astronaut (m1): 2m\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v1): 0.6c in the positive x-direction\n*   Mass of the second astronaut (m2): 3m\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v2): 0.5c in the positive x-direction\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nWe need to calculate:\n1.  The relative speed between the two astronauts (v_rel).\n2.  The total energy of the two-astronaut system (E_total) as measured from the initial reference frame.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **Relativistic Speeds:** The speeds of the astronauts are significant fractions of the speed of light (60% and 50%). Therefore, we must use relativistic formulas instead of classical (Newtonian) mechanics.\n2.  **Relative Velocity:** Classically, the relative speed would be a simple subtraction, `v1 - v2`. However, in special relativity, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. Since both velocities are in the same direction, the formula for relative velocity is `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`.\n3.  **Total Energy:** The total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is not just its kinetic energy but its total energy, given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual astronauts.\n4.  **Reference Frame:** The total energy of the system is calculated by summing the energies of the individual components as measured in a single inertial frame, which is the lab frame in this case.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n1.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   `v1 = 0.6c`\n    *   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n2.  **Apply the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:**\n    We want to find the speed of the first astronaut as seen from the second astronaut's frame (or vice versa; the magnitude will be the same).\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the numerator and the denominator:**\n    *   Numerator: `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`\n    *   Denominator: `1 - (0.30 * c^2) / c^2 = 1 - 0.30 = 0.7`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final relative speed:**\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c`\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.1428 c`\n    Rounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\n1.  **State the formula for the total energy of the system:**\n    The total energy is the sum of the individual total energies of each astronaut.\n    `E_total = E1 + E2 = (γ1 * m1 * c^2) + (γ2 * m2 * c^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n    *   Mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`.\n    *   First, find its Lorentz factor, `γ1`:\n        `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Now, calculate `E1`:\n        `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n    *   Mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`.\n    *   First, find its Lorentz factor, `γ2`:\n        `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        `γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   Now, calculate `E2`:\n        `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy of the system:**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, **E ≈ 5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy: `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
