    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Limiting Shape of the Aperture:**\n    *   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    *   A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides converges to a circle.\n    *   Therefore, the aperture can be treated as a circular aperture.\n\n2.  **Determine the Radius of the Circular Aperture:**\n    *   The problem states that all apothems are of the same length 'a'.\n    *   An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon perpendicular to one of its sides.\n    *   As N approaches infinity, the sides of the polygon become infinitesimally small and lie on the circumference of the limiting circle. The distance from the center to a side (the apothem) becomes equal to the distance from the center to the circumference (the radius).\n    *   Thus, the limiting circular aperture has a radius `R = a`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:**\n    *   The problem describes a monochromatic light wave passing through an aperture and forming an intensity pattern in the far-field region. This is Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   For a circular aperture, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n\n4.  **Recall the Formula for Minima in an Airy Pattern:**\n    *   The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius `a` is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n        where `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, and `θ` is the diffraction angle.\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator, `J₁(k * a * sinθ)`, is zero.\n    *   The locations of the minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n5.  **Find the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The condition for the n-th minimum is `k * a * sinθₙ = xₙ`, where `xₙ` is the n-th zero of `J₁(x)`.\n    *   Substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n        `(2π/λ) * a * sinθₙ = xₙ`\n        `sinθₙ = (xₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    *   The first two non-trivial zeros of `J₁(x)` are:\n        *   `x₁ ≈ 3.832` (for the first minimum)\n        *   `x₂ ≈ 7.016` (for the second minimum)\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, `sinθ ≈ θ`.\n    *   **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ ≈ (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.832 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a`\n    *   **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ ≈ (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.016 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ/a`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance between the Two Minima:**\n    *   The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima.\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ/a`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ/a`\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.507 λ/a`.\n    *   This matches option B, which is `0.506 λ/a`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Aperture Transformation:** The crucial first step is recognizing that an N-sided polygon with a fixed apothem becomes a circle of radius `R = a` as N → ∞. If it were a fixed circumradius, the conclusion would be the same, but the logic is tied to the apothem here.\n*   **Fraunhofer Diffraction:** The problem specifies the \"far-field region,\" which implies Fraunhofer diffraction, allowing the use of standard formulas for circular apertures.\n*   **Bessel Function Zeros:** The exact locations of the minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁`. Knowledge of the approximate values of the first two zeros (`~3.83` and `~7.02`) is essential.\n*   **Small Angle Approximation:** The instruction to use `tanθ ≈ θ` implies `sinθ ≈ θ` for small angles. This simplifies the formula `sinθₙ = ...` to `θₙ = ...`, making the final subtraction straightforward.\n*   **Distinguishing Between Position and Separation:** It's important not to confuse the angular position of a single minimum with the angular separation between two minima. Option D (`0.610 λ/a`) corresponds to the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`), not the separation `Δθ`.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Aperture:** N-sided polygon (N→∞), apothem `a` → Circle, radius `R=a`.\n2.  **Diffraction:** Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture (Airy Pattern).\n3.  **Minima Condition:** `θₙ ≈ (xₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`, where `xₙ` are the zeros of `J₁(x)`.\n4.  **Values:**\n    *   1st minimum: `θ₁ ≈ (3.832 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 λ/a`.\n    *   2nd minimum: `θ₂ ≈ (7.016 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 λ/a`.\n5.  **Separation:** `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) λ/a = 0.5068 λ/a`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The result `0.5068 λ/a` is best represented by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
