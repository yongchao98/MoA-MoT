    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound in barley. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to inactivate the protein (the enzyme). The most reliable way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects\nWe need to compare the DNA sequence of each mutant with the intact (wild-type) gene. The most effective mutations for inactivating a gene are:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** A change in a DNA codon that results in a premature STOP codon. This truncates the protein, almost always rendering it non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame, altering all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon.\n*   **Missense mutation:** A change that results in a different amino acid. This *may* inactivate the protein if the change occurs at a critical site, but often it only alters the protein's function or has no effect.\n*   **Silent mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not alter the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence\nFirst, let's break the intact gene's sequence into codons (triplets of bases). The reading frame starts with the start codon `ATG`.\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** 5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... -3’\n*   **Translated Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu ...\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Mutant\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Intact:**   5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT... -3’\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG T**TC** **TAC** GCT... -3’\n*   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   `TTT` → `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `CTC` → `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), and `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** The resulting protein has one amino acid changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Intact:**   5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT... -3’\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG T**TC** **TAA** GCT... -3’\n*   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` and the third codon `CTC` changes to `TAA`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   `TTT` → `TTC`: A silent mutation (Phe → Phe).\n    *   `CTC` → `TAA`: `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid. The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). Such a short peptide is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Intact:**   5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT GGT **ACT** **TCT** **GTG** ... -3’\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC** GCT GGT **GTC** **ACT** **TCT** ... -3’\n*   **Changes:** This sequence contains multiple base substitutions compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid changes. For example: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr), `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val), `TCT` (Ser) -> `ACT` (Thr), etc.\n*   **Effect:** These are multiple **missense mutations**. While multiple changes make protein inactivation more likely than a single change, a full-length (though altered) protein is still produced. It is less certain to be non-functional compared to a severely truncated protein.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Intact:**   5’-ATG TTT **CTC GCT GGT** ACT TCT... -3’\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT **TAC GCT** --- ACT TCT... -3’\n*   **Changes:** A comparison of the sequences reveals two changes: `CTC` changes to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and the entire `GGT` codon (Glycine) is deleted.\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid, combined with a missense mutation. The reading frame after the deletion is preserved. The resulting protein will be one amino acid shorter and have one other amino acid changed. Like the missense mutations, this could inactivate the protein, but it is not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nComparing the outcomes, the mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most likely to completely eliminate the function of the target protein. A nonsense mutation creates a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. The other mutations (missense, in-frame deletion) produce a full-length or near-full-length protein that might retain some or all of its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 offers the highest probability of success.\n\n<<<B>>>"
