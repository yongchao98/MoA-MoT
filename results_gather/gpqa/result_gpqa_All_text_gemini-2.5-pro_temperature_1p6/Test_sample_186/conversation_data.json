    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the detection limit of ESPRESSO\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure using one 8m VLT telescope (this is the 1-UT mode).\n\n1.  **Consult the ESPRESSO documentation:** We refer to the provided link, specifically the performance information. On the ESPRESSO overview page, there is a graph titled \"Expected S/N as a function of stellar V magnitude for a G2V star\". This graph shows the S/N ratio for a 1-hour exposure.\n2.  **Find the limiting magnitude:** We need to find the apparent V magnitude (m_V) that corresponds to an S/N of 10 on the curve for the 1-UT mode (one telescope).\n3.  **Read the graph:** Looking at the \"1-UT mode\" curve on the graph, an S/N of 10 (which is 10¹ on the logarithmic y-axis) is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude of approximately **V ≈ 16.5 mag**.\n4.  **Establish the detection rule:** Therefore, a star is considered detectable if its apparent V magnitude is less than or equal to 16.5 (m_V ≤ 16.5) AND it is visible from the Paranal Observatory.\n\n### Step 2: Check the visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nParanal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. This means it can observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and a portion of the northern celestial hemisphere. A star's visibility is determined by its declination (DEC).\n\n*   **Rule of thumb:** A star is generally not observable if it never rises above the horizon. For Paranal, stars with very high positive declinations (close to the North Celestial Pole) are not visible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each star individually\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is **m_V = -0.74**.\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of Canopus is approximately **DEC = -52° 41'**. This is in the southern celestial hemisphere and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Comparison:** Since m_V = -0.74 is much less than (brighter than) the 16.5 mag limit, Canopus is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude of Polaris is **m_V = +1.98**. This is well within the brightness limit.\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris is the North Star. Its declination is approximately **DEC = +89° 15'**. From a latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and can never be observed.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable** (due to its location).\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is **DEC = 0°** (on the celestial equator). This is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5.\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * (1) - 5\n    *   **m_V = 15.0**\n*   **Comparison:** Since m_V = 15.0 is less than the 16.5 mag limit, this star is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is **DEC = 0°**, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** Calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5\n    *   m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\n    *   m_V ≈ 15 + 11.5 - 5\n    *   **m_V ≈ 21.5**\n*   **Comparison:** Since m_V = 21.5 is greater than (fainter than) the 16.5 mag limit, this star is not detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is **DEC = 0°**, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** Calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5\n    *   m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   m_V ≈ 15 + 3.5 - 5\n    *   **m_V ≈ 13.5**\n*   **Comparison:** Since m_V = 13.5 is less than the 16.5 mag limit, this star is detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination is **DEC = 0°**, so it is observable.\n*   **Brightness:** Calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5\n    *   m_V ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\n    *   m_V ≈ 15 + 8.5 - 5\n    *   **m_V ≈ 18.5**\n*   **Comparison:** Since m_V = 18.5 is greater than (fainter than) the 16.5 mag limit, this star is not detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nLet's tally the detectable stars:\n1.  Canopus: Yes\n2.  Polaris: No\n3.  Star at 10 pc: Yes\n4.  Star at 200 pc: No\n5.  Star at 5 pc: Yes\n6.  Star at 50 pc: No\n\nThere are a total of **3** detectable stars. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
