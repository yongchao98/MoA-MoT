    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n**1. Understand the Detection Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be detected by both instruments, it must meet two separate criteria:\n*   **Positional Criterion:** The star must be visible from both observatory locations.\n*   **Magnitude Criterion:** The star must be bright enough to be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n**2. Analyze the Positional Criterion**\n\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory** is located in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude ≈ +20° N). It can observe the entire northern celestial sphere (DEC > 0) and a significant portion of the southern celestial sphere down to a declination of approximately -70°.\n*   The **Paranal Observatory** is located in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude ≈ -25° S). It can observe the entire southern celestial sphere (DEC < 0) and a significant portion of the northern celestial sphere up to a declination of approximately +65°.\n*   Therefore, the region of the sky visible to *both* observatories lies roughly between **DEC = -70° and DEC = +65°**. Any star with a declination outside this range cannot be observed by both.\n\n**3. Analyze the Magnitude Criterion**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., **m_V < 17**).\n*   **HIRES** can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (i.e., **m_V < 16**).\n*   For a star to be detected by *both*, it must meet the stricter requirement. Therefore, the combined magnitude limit is **m_V < 16**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against both the positional (-70° < DEC < +65°) and magnitude (m_V < 16) criteria. To find the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V), we use the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the interstellar extinction. Extinction is given by `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star1**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range for Keck Observatory (-70°).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star2**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = +55°. This is within the shared visible range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** The apparent magnitude is given directly as m_V = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit (16.5 is not < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star3**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = +48°. This is within the shared visible range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** The apparent V magnitude is given directly as m_V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the combined limit (15.5 < 16). The other information (E(B-V), distance) is not needed to determine if the star can be detected, as its apparent brightness is already provided.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be detected by both.**\n\n*   **Star4**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = -48°. This is within the shared visible range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n        *   Extinction: A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   Apparent Magnitude: m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit (16.74 is not < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star5**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = +60°. This is within the shared visible range.\n    *   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, no extinction is mentioned (A_V = 0).\n        *   Apparent Magnitude: m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = 15.0 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the combined limit (15.0 < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be detected by both.**\n\n**Final Summary**\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet both the positional and magnitude criteria for detection by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<B>>>"
