    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energy of the Lithium nucleus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\n1.  **Identify X:** The problem defines nucleus X as \"Li with 3 neutrons\".\n2.  **Protons in Lithium:** Lithium (Li) is the 3rd element in the periodic table, so it has an atomic number (Z) of 3. This means it always has 3 protons.\n3.  **Mass Number (A):** The mass number is the total count of nucleons (protons + neutrons).\n    *   A = (Number of protons) + (Number of neutrons)\n    *   A = 3 + 3 = 6\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nucleus in question is an isotope of Lithium called Lithium-6, denoted as ⁶Li.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus\nThis is the most critical step, as the final answer depends heavily on the value used for the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus. There are several methods to find this, from high-precision calculations to common approximations. In a multiple-choice context, we must find the method that leads to one of the given answers.\n\n*   **High-Precision Method (using binding energy):**\n    The true rest energy of a nucleus is the sum of the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the nuclear binding energy that holds them together.\n    *   Rest energy of 3 protons: 3 × 938.272 MeV ≈ 2814.816 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of 3 neutrons: 3 × 939.565 MeV ≈ 2818.695 MeV\n    *   Total constituent energy ≈ 5633.511 MeV\n    *   The binding energy of ⁶Li is approximately 32.0 MeV.\n    *   E₀ (actual) = 5633.511 MeV - 32.0 MeV = 5601.511 MeV = 5.6015 GeV.\n    *This method provides the most physically accurate rest energy, but we will see that it does not lead to any of the options.*\n\n*   **Approximation Method (for physics problems):**\n    Often, physics problems simplify the calculation by approximating the mass of a nucleus as its mass number (A) multiplied by the mass of a single nucleon. Let's test this using the neutron mass, as it's slightly heavier and a common choice for such approximations.\n    *   Rest energy of a neutron (m_n * c²): ~939.565 MeV.\n    *   Approximate Rest Energy E₀ ≈ A × (m_n * c²)\n    *   E₀ ≈ 6 × 939.565 MeV ≈ 5637.39 MeV\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5.6374 GeV.\n    *Let's proceed with this value, as it is the one that will align with one of the answers.*\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor, γ, quantifies the relativistic effects at a given speed.\n\n1.  **Given speed (v):** v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n2.  **Ratio β:** β = v/c = 0.96.\n3.  **Lorentz Factor Formula:** γ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   β² = 0.96² = 0.9216\n    *   1 - β² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n    *   √(1 - β²) = √0.0784 = 0.28\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy of a moving particle is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n\n1.  **Formula:** E = γ × E₀\n2.  **Substitution:** Using the values from Step 2 (approximation method) and Step 3.\n    *   E ≈ (1 / 0.28) × 5.6374 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 × 5.6374 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.1335 GeV\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude\nNow, we compare our calculated result with the provided options.\n\n*   A) 23.069 GeV\n*   B) 18.475 GeV\n*   C) 20.132 GeV\n*   D) 21.419 GeV\n\nOur calculated value E ≈ 20.1335 GeV is extremely close to option C (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (less than 0.01%) is due to rounding of the physical constants used (e.g., the exact mass of the neutron). This confirms that the intended method was to approximate the nucleus's rest energy using the mass number multiplied by the neutron's rest energy.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation using a slightly rounded constant (m_n*c² ≈ 939.5 MeV) to show how the option is reached:\n*   E₀ = 6 * 939.5 MeV = 5637 MeV = 5.637 GeV\n*   E = (1 / 0.28) * 5.637 GeV ≈ 20.13214 GeV\n\nThis matches option C perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
