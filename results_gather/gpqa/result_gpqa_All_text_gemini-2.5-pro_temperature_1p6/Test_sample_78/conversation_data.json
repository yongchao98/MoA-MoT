    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we analyze the given ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data to deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C₁₁H₁₂O. Since the reaction is a rearrangement (a common reaction for epoxides under these conditions), the product will have the same molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₁₁H₁₂O is calculated as:\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n\nLet's break down the NMR signals:\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a **ketone** carbonyl carbon (C=O). This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1:** There are six signals in the aromatic/vinylic region (120-150 ppm), accounting for a total of 8 carbons (`126.9 (2C)`, `127.1 (1C)`, `129.1 (2C)`, `130.3 (1C)`, `141.5 (1C)`, `144.1 (1C)`). This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and a C=C double bond (1 DBE). Total DBE = 1 (C=O) + 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) = 6, which matches our calculation.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and δ 28.4 (1C):** These are two aliphatic carbons, likely methyl groups, as supported by the ¹H NMR.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two distinct methyl (CH₃) groups that are singlets, meaning they have no adjacent protons.\n        *   A methyl group attached to a ketone (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH₃) typically appears as a singlet around δ 2.1-2.4 ppm.\n        *   A methyl group attached to a benzene ring (a tolyl group) typically appears as a singlet around δ 2.3-2.4 ppm.\n        *   This suggests the presence of both an acetyl group and a tolyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic/Vinylic Region (δ 6.75 - 7.71):** There are 6 protons in this region.\n        *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This classic A₂B₂ pattern (two doublets, each integrating to 2H) is indicative of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n        *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two doublets, each integrating to 1H. They are coupled to each other and represent the two protons of a **disubstituted C=C double bond** (vinylic protons). The significant difference in chemical shift is typical for an α,β-unsaturated system, where the proton β to the carbonyl is strongly deshielded.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   We have two methyl groups, one likely on the ring (making it a *p*-tolyl group) and one part of an acetyl group.\n    *   We have an α,β-unsaturated ketone system.\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   Structure: `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n        *   `p-tolyl` group explains the `CH₃` singlet (e.g., δ 2.31) and the `2H d, 2H d` pattern for the aromatic protons.\n        *   `-CH=CH-` group explains the two `1H d` signals for the vinylic protons.\n        *   `-C(=O)CH₃` group explains the ketone carbon (δ 197.7) and the second `CH₃` singlet (e.g., δ 2.28).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nNow we must determine which of the given options for Compound X, an epoxide isomer, would rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Option B) 2-styrylepoxide (C₁₀H₁₀O):** Incorrect molecular formula.\n*   **Option C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane** and **Option D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Both contain a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a *p*-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-). They cannot be the precursor to a product containing a *p*-tolyl group, as the reaction conditions do not support adding a methyl group to the ring.\n\n*   **Option A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `(p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` (the last three atoms form the oxirane/epoxide ring).\n    *   **Formula Check:** (C₇H₇ for p-tolyl) + (C₂H₂ for vinyl) + (C₂H₃O for oxirane) = C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n    *   **Substituent Check:** It contains the required *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   By elimination, this must be the correct starting material.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Reaction Mechanism (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nWe need to confirm that Compound A can plausibly rearrange to the identified product under the reaction conditions (DABCO, base; high temperature). A known rearrangement pathway for vinylic epoxides proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The base (DABCO) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is the allylic proton on the epoxide ring (`-CH=CH-CH(O)-`).\n2.  **Ring-Opening:** The resulting carbanion intermediate undergoes ring-opening to form an allenyl alkoxide (`-CH=C=CH-CH₂O⁻`).\n3.  **Protonation:** The alkoxide is protonated to give an allenyl alcohol (`-CH=C=CH-CH₂OH`).\n4.  **Tautomerization:** The unstable allenyl alcohol rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable conjugated ketone, which is the final product (`-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`).\n\nThis mechanism confirms that reactant A can indeed rearrange to the product deduced from the NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe product of the reaction is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Analyzing the options, only compound A, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, has the correct molecular formula and the necessary *p*-tolyl group to form this product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
