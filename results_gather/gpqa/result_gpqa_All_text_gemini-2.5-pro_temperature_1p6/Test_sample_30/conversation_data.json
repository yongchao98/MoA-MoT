    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the molecular symmetry group of the final product.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid (Nitration)**\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃), Nitric Acid (HNO₃), and Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration. The mixture of HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), a powerful electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on the toluene ring is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Product 1:** The nitration will yield a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* isomer is the major product. In multi-step synthesis problems, it is standard practice to carry the major product forward.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄ (Oxidation)**\n*   **Reactant:** p-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Oxidation of a benzylic carbon. The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Reagent Ambiguity:** MnO₂ is often cited as a mild oxidant that selectively oxidizes benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. However, in the presence of strong acid (H₂SO₄), a more forceful oxidation is possible. The oxidation could proceed all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Alternatively, it might stop at the aldehyde (-CHO) stage. To determine the correct path, we must consider the subsequent reaction.\n*   **Path A (Oxidation to Carboxylic Acid):** If Product 2 were p-nitrobenzoic acid, its reaction with acetone and base would likely form a Meisenheimer complex. This complex possesses a chiral center and would have C₁ symmetry, which is not among the options.\n*   **Path B (Oxidation to Aldehyde):** If Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde, its reaction with acetone and base is a well-known Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which leads to a product with a plausible symmetry from the given options. This suggests Path B is the intended route for this problem.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (Condensation)**\n*   **Reactants:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde, acetone (CH₃COCH₃), and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. p-Nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and acts as the electrophile. Acetone has acidic α-hydrogens and, after deprotonation by NaOH, forms a nucleophilic enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The acetone enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    2.  An intermediate β-hydroxy ketone is formed.\n    3.  This intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The trans (E) isomer is thermodynamically more stable and thus the major product.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3 ((E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one)**\n*   **Molecular Geometry:** The molecule has an extended π-conjugated system (benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize stability, these components will adopt a planar conformation. Therefore, the benzene ring, the NO₂ group, the C=C atoms, and the C=O group can all lie in the same plane.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane containing the planar framework of the molecule (the C₆H₄ ring, NO₂, -CH=CH-CO-) is a plane of symmetry. For this to be true, the methyl (-CH₃) group can be oriented so that one of its C-H bonds is also in this plane, leaving the other two H atoms as mirror images of each other across the plane.\n    3.  **Axis of Rotation (Cn, n>1):** There is no axis of rotation. A C₂ axis through the C₁-C₄ bond of the phenyl ring is ruled out because the substituent (-CH=CH-CO-CH₃) is not symmetric with respect to 180° rotation.\n    4.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** A molecule possessing only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe reaction sequence yields (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This molecule has a single plane of symmetry as its only non-identity symmetry element. Therefore, its molecular symmetry group is Cs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
