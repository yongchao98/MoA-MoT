    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down its structure based on the IUPAC name.\n    *   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid`. This indicates a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4. The principal functional group, carboxylic acid (-COOH), is at position 1.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   **Key Structural Features:**\n        *   One six-membered ring.\n        *   One carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (C=C).\n        *   One carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (C=C).\n        *   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (C=O).\n        *   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Reagents:**\n    The reactant is treated with \"red phosphorus and excess of HI\" (Red P/HI).\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Its primary function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds completely to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n\n3.  **Determine the Effect of the Reagent on the Starting Material:**\n    We need to consider how Red P/HI affects each functional group and structural feature identified in Step 1.\n    *   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** Red P/HI reduces a carboxylic acid group completely to a methyl group (-CH3). All oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   **Formyl Group (-CHO):** Red P/HI reduces an aldehyde group completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Vinyl Group (-CH=CH2):** The alkene double bond is reduced (hydrogenated) to a single bond. The vinyl group becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Cyclohexene Ring:** The double bond within the ring (at the 3-position) is reduced to a single bond. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product:**\n    By applying the transformations from Step 3, we can determine the structure of the product.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `-COOH` group at C1 becomes a `-CH3` group.\n    *   The `-CHO` group at C2 becomes a `-CH3` group.\n    *   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 becomes a `-CH2CH3` group.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (after renumbering according to IUPAC rules, though the specific name is not required).\n    *   The crucial point is that the product is a **saturated cycloalkane**. It contains one ring and only single bonds (no pi bonds).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a count of how many pairs of hydrogen atoms a molecule is \"missing\" compared to the corresponding saturated acyclic alkane. It can be calculated with the formula:\n    **IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds)**\n\n    *   **Number of Rings:** The product molecule contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   **Number of Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P/HI reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1\n\n**Alternative IHD Calculation using Molecular Formula:**\n*   **Carbons:** The starting material has a 6-carbon ring, a 1-carbon carboxylic acid, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group. Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. The carbon count does not change during the reduction. So, the product has 10 carbons.\n*   **Formula of Product:** The product is a substituted cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. For n=10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n*   **IHD Formula:** IHD = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a hydrocarbon)\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that Red P/HI is a powerful reducing agent that simplifies the structure significantly by removing all oxygens and saturating all pi bonds.\n*   Focus on the structure of the final product, not the potentially complex structure or exact molecular formula of the starting material. The key is to track the transformations of the functional groups and the carbon skeleton.\n*   The IHD of a simple saturated cycloalkane is always 1, because it has one ring and no pi bonds.\n\nFinal Answer Conclusion: The product is a saturated cycloalkane containing one ring. Its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
