    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the **mean decay distance** of the particle X in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels after its creation before it decays.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Key Concepts and Formulas\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$). The relationship is:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau)$\n\n4.  **Combining Formulas:** We can combine these formulas to get a direct expression for the decay distance:\n    $L = \\gamma \\cdot v \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    Using the dimensionless velocity $\\beta = v/c$, we can write this as:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    This final form is very convenient for calculations in particle physics.\n\n5.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The term $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n    *   The total energy is related to momentum ($p$) and mass ($m$) by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   From this, we find the momentum: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   The momentum is also related to the Lorentz factor and velocity by $p = \\gamma m v$, which gives $pc = \\gamma \\beta mc^2$.\n    *   Therefore, we can calculate $\\gamma \\beta$ as: $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n### Step 3: List Careful Points and Constants\n*   **Units must be consistent.** The given energies are in GeV and MeV. We will convert everything to a single unit, like GeV.\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   **Use appropriate physical constants.** The combined constant $\\hbar c$ is most useful here. Its value is:\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm} \\approx 0.1973 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$\n    *   Note that $1 \\text{ fm (femtometer)} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Calculate the relativistic term $\\gamma\\beta$:**\nUsing the formula derived in Step 2:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2}$\n$\\gamma \\beta \\approx \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n**2. Calculate the decay length in the particle's rest frame ($c\\tau$):**\nThis is the term $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{0.1973 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} \\approx 0.6166 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**3. Calculate the mean decay distance L in the lab frame:**\nUsing the formula $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$:\n$L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166 \\text{ fm})$\n$L \\approx 4.064 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**4. Convert the result to meters:**\nSince $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n$L \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated value is approximately $4.064 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nOur calculated result matches option C very closely in both the numerical value and the order of magnitude ($10^{-15}$). The slight difference in the last decimal places is due to using more precise values for the constants in the official calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
