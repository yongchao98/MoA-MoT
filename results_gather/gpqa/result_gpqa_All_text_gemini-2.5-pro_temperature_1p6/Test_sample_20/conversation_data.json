    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n**Step 1: Understand Tautomerism**\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to (the alpha-carbon) must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Benzoquinone**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Let's examine the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl carbon is bonded to two other carbons within the ring. These adjacent carbons are part of a C=C double bond (they are sp² hybridized). They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them.\n*   **Careful Point:** The other carbons in the ring do have hydrogen atoms, but they are also sp² hybridized carbons of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, we need an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Benzoquinone lacks such a carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, it does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**\n*   **Structure:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n*   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Let's examine the carbons adjacent to any of the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbonyl at C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. Both C2 and C6 are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens.\n*   **Careful Point:** Because it has alpha-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize to form phloroglucinol (benzene-1,3,5-triol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. This carbon is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (–H)\n    3.  A methyl group (–CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (–COOCH₃)\n*   **Careful Point:** Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it contains a chiral center and is not a meso compound (which requires multiple chiral centers), methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is *trans*-butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃, with the two –COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** We need to check if the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. More importantly, it possesses a center of inversion (a point in the center of the C=C bond) and a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the molecule itself).\n*   **Careful Point:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral and cannot be optically active.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, exhibit geometric isomerism (its cis-isomer is dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
