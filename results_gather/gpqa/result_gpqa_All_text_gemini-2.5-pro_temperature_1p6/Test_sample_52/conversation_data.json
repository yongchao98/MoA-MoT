    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information from the problem statement.**\n\n*   **Structure Core**: The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents attached. The core of this ring is C6H4. The aromatic ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one for the ring itself and three for the double bonds).\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group is indicated. An ester group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms (O2) and a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). The C=O bond adds 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum has a total of six distinct signals, which tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals)**: The C6H4 ring has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. These two signals account for a total of **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals)**: Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a C=C double bond.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton is adjacent to only one other proton (n=1, so n+1=2 lines, a doublet).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This means this proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, where n=3, so n+1=4 lines, a quartet).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group. This fragment has two vinyl hydrogens and one methyl group. The two vinyl signals account for **2 hydrogens**.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals)**: There are two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   One -CH3 group is the one in the prop-1-enyl fragment we just identified. Its signal would be split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton. This accounts for **3 hydrogens**.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere in the molecule. Since there is an ester group, it is likely part of the ester, forming either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3). This accounts for another **3 hydrogens**.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups**: This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any ethyl, n-propyl, or other such alkyl chains.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n\nBased on the NMR analysis, we can sum the number of hydrogen atoms corresponding to all the signals:\n*   Aromatic H: 4 H\n*   Vinyl H: 2 H (1H + 1H)\n*   Methyl H: 6 H (3H + 3H)\n*   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 H**\n\nThis total hydrogen count allows us to immediately eliminate two of the possible answers:\n*   A) C11H14O2 (has 14 H) - Incorrect.\n*   C) C12H14O2 (has 14 H) - Incorrect.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: B) C11H12O2 and D) C12H12O2.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the molecular fragments to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n\nLet's assemble the pieces we have identified:\n*   **Aromatic Ring**: C6 (from C6H4)\n*   **One substituent is the prop-1-enyl group**: -CH=CH-CH3, which contains **C3**.\n*   **The other substituent is the ester group containing the second methyl group**:\n    *   Case 1: Methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This contains the C=O carbon and the methyl carbon. This fragment is **C2**.\n    *   Case 2: Acetoxy group (-OCOCH3). This contains the C=O carbon and the methyl carbon. This fragment is also **C2**.\n    *   In both valid possibilities, this part of the molecule contributes **2 carbons**.\n\nNow, let's sum the number of carbon atoms:\n*   Aromatic Ring: 6 C\n*   Prop-1-enyl group: 3 C\n*   Ester/Methyl part: 2 C\n*   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the final chemical formula.**\n\nFrom our analysis:\n*   Number of Carbon atoms = 11\n*   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 12\n*   Number of Oxygen atoms = 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option B. The structure is likely methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate, both of which have the formula C11H12O2 and fit all the spectral data.\n\n**Final check using Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n*   Calculated formula: C11H12O2\n*   DBE = (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = (24-12)/2 = 6\n*   DBE from structure fragments: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C bond) + 1 (C=O bond) = 6.\n*   The DBE matches, confirming our conclusion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
