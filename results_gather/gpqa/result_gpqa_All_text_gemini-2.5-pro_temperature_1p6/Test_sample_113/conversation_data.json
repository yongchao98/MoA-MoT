    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given reactions to determine the suitable reagents A and B.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. A cyanide ion (CN⁻) is added to a ketone (butan-2-one).\n2.  **Analyze the reactants and product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Butan-2-one (CH₃COCH₂CH₃) is a ketone.\n    *   **Reactant:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is an ionic salt that provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The carbonyl group (C=O) of the ketone has been converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a nitrile group (-CN) attached to the same carbon atom.\n3.  **Step-by-step mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation.** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a strong base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable cyanohydrin product.\n        `CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃`\n4.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide the proton (H⁺) needed for the second step.\n    *   Looking at the options for A: `H₃O⁺` and `NaHSO₃`.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution (like dilute HCl or H₂SO₄) and is a direct source of protons. This is a standard reagent used to protonate alkoxides.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is a reagent used for a different addition reaction with carbonyl compounds and is not the correct choice for protonating the alkoxide in cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Therefore, reagent A must be a proton source, which is correctly represented by `H₃O⁺`.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group.\n2.  **Analyze the reactants and product:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile contains a nitrile functional group (-C≡N).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The transformation is the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n3.  **Reaction Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a standard organic reaction that requires water and is typically catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, usually with heating.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ (catalyst) → R-COOH + NH₄⁺`\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + H₂O + OH⁻ (catalyst) → R-COO⁻ + NH₃`. An acidic workup is then needed to get the carboxylic acid.\n4.  **Determine Reagent B:** The reaction shows direct conversion to the carboxylic acid in the presence of water and reagent B. Reagent B acts as the catalyst.\n    *   Looking at the options for B: `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is an effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak organic acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze this hydrolysis effectively or to completion under mild conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Therefore, reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst, making `HCl` the suitable choice.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
