    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the observations**\n\n1.  **Compound Type:** A chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. Peptides contain chiral centers (the alpha-carbon of most amino acids).\n2.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a single proton (an alpha-proton).\n    *   The integrals of these two peaks are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to one proton. This indicates a mixture of two species in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The peaks have similar, but not identical, chemical shifts. This means the proton exists in two very similar, but chemically non-equivalent, environments.\n    *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the two peaks are not part of a multiplet. They represent two distinct populations of the molecule.\n3.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The sample separates into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). This confirms the presence of two different chemical species that have different interactions with the stationary phase.\n    *   The two LC peaks have equal intensities, corroborating the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   The mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical.\n    *   The mass spectrum matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide. This is a critical point: the two species are isomers (they have the same molecular formula and mass). This rules out impurities that have a different chemical formula, such as precursors or byproducts from adding/losing atoms.\n    *   The separation is performed at an \"elevated temperature,\" and the peaks are \"clearly defined.\" This suggests the two species are stable and do not interconvert rapidly on the timescale of the chromatography experiment under these conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the proposed explanations based on the observations**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and with a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of NMR peaks and a single LC peak.\n    *   This explanation contradicts both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor from the synthesis would have a different molecular structure and, almost certainly, a different molecular weight.\n    *   The MS data shows that both separated compounds have the same mass as the final product.\n    *   This explanation contradicts the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This typically means that an extra amino acid unit has been unintentionally added to the peptide chain.\n    *   This would result in a product with a significantly higher mass than the expected molecule.\n    *   This explanation contradicts the mass spectrometry data, which shows the correct mass for both peaks.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at least at one, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, a common cause is the racemization (e.g., L to D conversion) of one amino acid's alpha-carbon during the coupling reaction.\n    *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. They are not chemically equivalent and will give different NMR spectra. Protons, especially those close to the altered stereocenter (like the alpha-proton), will have different chemical shifts. A ~1:1 mixture would show two peaks of equal intensity for such protons. This fits the NMR data perfectly.\n    *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because diastereoisomers have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard achiral chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC. As they are isomers, they have the exact same molecular formula and mass, which explains why both peaks give the identical, correct mass spectrum. A ~1:1 mixture explains the equal peak intensities. This fits the LC-MS data perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe observation of two distinct but isomeric species that are separable by chromatography and distinguishable by NMR is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is most commonly caused by racemization at one of the chiral centers during a coupling step.\n\n<<<D>>>"
