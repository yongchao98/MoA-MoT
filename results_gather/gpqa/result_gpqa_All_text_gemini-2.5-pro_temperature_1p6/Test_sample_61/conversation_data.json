    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexyl group attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Its formula is C8H12.\n    *   `C6H11-C≡CH`\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this name to determine its structure.\n    *   **Parent:** Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n    *   **Numbering:** The carbon atom of the cyclohexane ring that is attached to the -CHO group is designated as position 1.\n    *   **Substituent:** At position 1, there is a group named `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This means a methyl group that is substituted with both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxy (-OH) group. The structure of this substituent is `-CH(OH)(C6H11)`.\n    *   **Final Structure:** A cyclohexane ring has two groups on the same carbon (C1): a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)(C6H11) group. The C1 atom is a quaternary center.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The product has two cyclohexyl rings (one in the parent, one in the substituent). The total carbon count is 6 (parent ring) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (methine carbon in substituent) + 6 (cyclohexyl in substituent) = 14 carbons.\n\n**Careful Point:** There is a significant discrepancy between the likely product of a simple reaction sequence and the named target product. The self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would yield `2-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. The named product, with substitution at C1, is a constitutional isomer but is very difficult to form via standard reactions. It is highly probable that there is a typo in the question's product name and the intended product is the aldol adduct (the 2-substituted isomer). We will proceed by finding the best route to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then induce its self-condensation.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it can produce the necessary intermediate (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and then the final aldol product.\n\n**Sequence A:**\n1.  `NaNH2, methyl chloride`: Ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated by NaNH2 to form the sodium acetylide (`C6H11-C≡C:⁻Na⁺`). This nucleophile then reacts with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in an SN2 reaction to form 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C6H11-C≡C-CH3`).\n2.  `H2/Pd`: This is catalytic hydrogenation which will reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane, forming propylcyclohexane (`C6H11-CH2CH2CH3`).\n3.  `Ba(OH)2`: Barium hydroxide is a base and will not react with an alkane.\n4.  `H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O`: This is for alkyne hydration. This step is placed after the alkyne has been fully reduced, so it's useless.\n**Conclusion for A:** The order of reagents is incorrect, and the sequence as written does not lead to the target molecule. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Sequence B:**\n1.  `NaNH2, methyl chloride`: Same as in A, this step forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C6H11-C≡C-CH3`).\n2.  `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate`: This reagent combination is Lindlar's catalyst. It performs a syn-hydrogenation of an alkyne to a cis-alkene. This step produces cis-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (`cis-C6H11-CH=CH-CH3`).\n3.  `O3/ (CH3)2S`: This is ozonolysis followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide. This reaction cleaves the double bond and converts each carbon of the double bond into a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone). Cleavage of `cis-C6H11-CH=CH-CH3` yields cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C6H11-CHO`) and acetaldehyde (`CH3CHO`). This successfully creates our key intermediate.\n4.  `Ba(OH)2`: Barium hydroxide is a strong base commonly used to catalyze aldol condensations. In the mixture of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde, four possible aldol products can form (two self-condensations and two crossed condensations). One of these products is the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which leads to `2-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, the likely intended product.\n**Conclusion for B:** This sequence is a chemically sound, albeit not perfectly selective, method for producing the intended aldol product.\n\n**Sequence C:**\n1.  `NaNH2, ethyl chloride`: Forms 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (`C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3`).\n2.  `Li/liq. NH3`: This is a dissolving metal reduction (Birch reduction conditions for alkynes) which reduces the alkyne to a trans-alkene, `trans-C6H11-CH=CH-CH2CH3`.\n3.  `O3/ H2O`: Ozonolysis is correct, but workup with plain water can sometimes lead to oxidative conditions (forming carboxylic acids), especially if H2O2 is formed as a byproduct. Assuming a reductive workup is intended, this would produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C6H11-CHO`) and propanal (`CH3CH2CHO`).\n4.  `NH4OH`: Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base. While it can catalyze some condensations, it is generally not an effective reagent for promoting aldol condensations, which typically require a stronger base like NaOH, KOH, or Ba(OH)2.\n**Conclusion for C:** This sequence is less efficient and plausible than sequence B, primarily due to the use of a weak base in the final step.\n\n**Sequence D:**\n1.  `NaNH2, methanol`: `NaNH2` deprotonates the alkyne to give `C6H11-C≡C:⁻Na⁺`. However, methanol (CH3OH) is a protic solvent and an acid (stronger than the alkyne). It will immediately protonate the acetylide anion, regenerating the starting material ethynylcyclohexane. `C6H11-C≡C:⁻Na⁺ + CH3OH → C6H11-C≡CH + Na⁺⁻OCH3`.\n**Conclusion for D:** This sequence is chemically flawed from the first step and will not proceed as intended.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, sequence B provides the most logical and effective series of reactions to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then perform an aldol condensation to obtain the product. The discrepancy in the product name (1-substituted vs. the expected 2-substituted) is almost certainly a typo in the question. Sequence B uses standard and appropriate reagents for each transformation (Lindlar for cis-alkene, ozonolysis for aldehyde, Ba(OH)2 for aldol).\n\n<<<B>>>"
