    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure and Stereochemistry**\n\nThe product of both reactions is an enantiomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (all single bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring.\n*   **Numbering**: According to IUPAC rules for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is given position 1. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is C2. The ring atoms are O(1), C(2), C(3), C(4), C(5), C(6).\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to C4.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The C4 atom is attached to four different groups (a hydrogen atom, an ethyl group, and two different paths around the ring), making it a chiral center.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring). The two products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Open-Chain Precursor**\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxycarboxylic acid. We can determine the structure of the precursor acid by conceptually hydrolyzing the lactone (breaking the ester bond between O1 and C2).\n*   Hydrolysis of the lactone gives the open-chain hydroxy acid:\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`\n*   Let's name this precursor. The main chain is a carboxylic acid. Numbering starts from the carboxyl carbon (C1).\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH`\n*   The parent chain has 5 carbons, so it's a **pentanoic acid**.\n*   It has an ethyl group at C3 and a hydroxyl group at C5.\n*   The precursor's name is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center of the lactone (C4) corresponds to the chiral center of the precursor acid (C3).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B)**: The options provided are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Although the IUPAC name is slightly ambiguous, it's standard chemical shorthand for a mono-ester of **3-ethylpentanedioic acid**. The structure is:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)`\n    This molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an ester (-COO-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: A reducing agent that is more reactive towards esters than carboxylic acids. It will selectively reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane)**: A reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids over esters. It will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The starting material `A` is treated with LiBH₄.\n    2.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction and lactonization) occur at C1 and C5. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**. The configuration of the starting material `A` at C3 will be the same as the configuration of the product at C4.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (R)-enantiomer, the starting material `A` must also be the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism**:\n    1.  The starting material `B` is treated with BH₃.\n    2.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group at C5 is unaffected.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate **isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**.\n    4.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization (transesterification). The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the same 6-membered lactone product and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction 1, the reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is the (S)-enantiomer, the starting material `B` must also be the (S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
