    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify and analyze substance Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, which is a constituent of mixture Y, a widely used solvent, and is formed by the complete hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y.\n*   The fact that Z is the final product of hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (m × Atomic Mass of H) / (n × Atomic Mass of C + m × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   0.1428 ≈ (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\n    *   Solving for the ratio m/n:\n        0.1428 = m / (12n + m)\n        0.1428 × (12n + m) = m\n        1.7136n + 0.1428m = m\n        1.7136n = m - 0.1428m\n        1.7136n = 0.8572m\n        m/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂. Saturated hydrocarbons with the general formula CₙH₂ₙ are cycloalkanes.\n*   Z is a common solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C₅H₁₀) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's check the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂):\n    *   Mass % of H = (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7). Thus, Z is very likely cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Mixture Y is hydrogenated to give only substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. So, Y₁ = Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, Y₁ (cyclohexane) does not react, and Y₂ must be hydrogenated to also form Z (cyclohexane).\n*   For Y₂ to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must have a six-carbon ring structure. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound with a six-carbon ring is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to form cyclohexane.\n    *   C₆H₆ + 3H₂ --(Pt, heat/pressure)--> C₆H₁₂\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When mixture X is treated with platinum upon heating, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y {benzene (C₆H₆), cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)}. Disproportionation in this context means a transfer of hydrogen atoms between molecules.\n*   The overall reaction conserves atoms. Since the starting mixture X and the product mixture Y are both equimolar, we can consider the reaction of one molecule of each component of X to form one molecule of each component of Y.\n    *   Reactants: X₁ + X₂\n    *   Products: C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂\n*   By conservation of atoms:\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 6 = 12. So, X₁ and X₂ together must have 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 12 = 18. So, X₁ and X₂ together must have 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   We also know that hydrogenation of both X₁ and X₂ produces only Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). This means both X₁ and X₂ must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. So their formulas are C₆Hₐ and C₆Hᵦ.\n*   From the atom balance, a + b = 18.\n*   Both X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated, so a < 12 and b < 12.\n*   The C₆ unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds are:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) - Note: 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and is therefore excluded.\n*   Let's check if these two compounds fit our requirements:\n    *   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n    *   X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is oxidized to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is reduced to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n*   Liquid 1 (from mixture X) is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 (from mixture X) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
