    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which molecule has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand the C3h Symmetry Point Group**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements and no others that would place it in a higher symmetry group:\n*   **A C3 axis:** A three-fold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n*   **A σh plane:** A horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n*   The presence of both C3 and σh implies the presence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n*   Crucially, to be C3h and not a higher symmetry group like D3h, the molecule must **lack** C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and σv (vertical) mirror planes.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]. The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to find if a conformation exists that has C3h symmetry.\n    *   Let's place the central boron atom and the three oxygen atoms in a plane (the xy-plane). This establishes a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane (the z-axis). The plane itself is a candidate for the required σh mirror plane.\n    *   For the C3 axis to be valid, all three isopropyl groups must adopt the same conformation relative to their B-O bonds.\n    *   For the xy-plane to be a σh mirror plane, reflecting any atom at a coordinate `z` must result in an identical atom at `-z`. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2, is not itself planar. However, we can orient it to be symmetric with respect to the xy-plane.\n    *   Consider one isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. If we orient it so that its central carbon atom (the one bonded to O) and the hydrogen attached to it lie *within* the xy-plane, the two methyl (-CH3) groups will be positioned tetrahedrally, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   Reflecting this arrangement through the xy-plane (our σh) simply swaps the positions of the \"up\" methyl group and the \"down\" methyl group, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this specific conformation, the entire molecule will have a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   This conformation does not possess perpendicular C2 axes or any σv planes.\n    *   Therefore, a stable conformation of triisopropyl borate exists that belongs precisely to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**C) quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a rigid, bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a clear C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing C-H group.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis because reflecting the nitrogen-containing end of the molecule would not map onto the C-H end.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. This is not C3h.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings. The molecule is planar and rigid.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   As the molecule is planar, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   However, due to its high symmetry, it **also** possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The presence of these additional C2 and σv elements places the molecule in the **D3h** point group. A molecule can only belong to one point group, so it is D3h, not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, fused-ring system. Due to severe steric hindrance between the inward-pointing oxygen atoms of the anhydride rings, the molecule is forced to twist out of planarity into a propeller-like shape.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The propeller shape has a C3 axis.\n    *   Because it is twisted and non-planar, it **lacks** a horizontal mirror plane (σh). A molecule with a σh plane is always achiral, while this propeller-shaped molecule is chiral.\n    *   It does possess three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The point group is **D3**. This is not C3h.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   The triphenylene derivative is D3.\n*   The benzo derivative is D3h.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule for which a conformation exists that belongs exactly to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
