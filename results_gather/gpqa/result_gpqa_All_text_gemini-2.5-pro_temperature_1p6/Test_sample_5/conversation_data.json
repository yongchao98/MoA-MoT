    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question and Initial Setup**\n*   **System:** A particle of mass 'm' in a 2D potential.\n*   **Potential:** The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ).\n*   **Goal:** Find the energy spectrum, E.\n*   **Observation:** The answer choices are given in terms of quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are associated with Cartesian coordinates (x, y). This is a strong hint that the problem is simpler to solve in Cartesian coordinates.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n*   The primary task is to convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n*   We must use the standard coordinate transformation relations:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n*   Once the potential is in Cartesian form, V(x, y), we need to check if it is separable, meaning V(x, y) can be written as V_x(x) + V_y(y).\n*   If the potential is separable, it describes two independent one-dimensional systems. The total energy will be the sum of the energies of these two systems (E = E_x + E_y).\n*   The resulting potentials, V_x(x) and V_y(y), are likely to be of the form of a simple harmonic oscillator, V(z) = 1/2 mω²z², for which the energy eigenvalues are known to be E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω.\n*   We will need to carefully extract the angular frequencies, ω_x and ω_y, by comparing our potential terms with the standard harmonic oscillator potential form.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Energy Spectrum**\n\n*   **Step 1: Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n    We start with the given potential:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\n    Using the transformations x = r cos(θ) and r² = x² + y², we can rewrite the terms.\n    From x = r cos(θ), we can write cos(θ) = x/r.\n    Substituting these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k (r²) * (x/r)²\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\n    Now, simplify the expression by combining like terms:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n*   **Step 2: Separate the Potential and Identify Harmonic Oscillators**\n    The potential is now in Cartesian coordinates and is clearly separable:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx² and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\n    This represents two independent simple harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Oscillator Frequencies (ω_x and ω_y)**\n    The general form of the harmonic oscillator potential is V = 1/2 mω²z². We compare our terms to this form.\n\n    For the x-direction:\n    V_x(x) = 2kx²\n    Comparing with 1/2 mω_x²x², we get:\n    1/2 mω_x² = 2k\n    mω_x² = 4k\n    ω_x² = 4k/m  =>  ω_x = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    For the y-direction:\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n    Comparing with 1/2 mω_y²y², we get:\n    1/2 mω_y² = 1/2 k\n    mω_y² = k\n    ω_y² = k/m  =>  ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n    The energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω. The total energy is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions.\n\n    Energy in the x-direction:\n    E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Energy in the y-direction:\n    E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The total energy E is E = E_x + E_y:\n    E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 * ℏ*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\n    Our derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n    This matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
