    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics and the RV Method**\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method, or Doppler spectroscopy, detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic change in a star's radial velocity. This change is caused by the star \"wobbling\" as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity towards or away from us (the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as $K_{star}$).\nSo, we can write:\n$K_{star} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$\n\nThis means the ratio of the stars' radial velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts.\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Star's Velocity ($K_{star}$) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\nTo find the relationship between $K_{star}$ and the orbital period $P$, we need to combine several physics principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** In the star-planet system, $M_{star} v_{star} = M_{pl} v_{pl}$. Since we are observing the radial component, and assuming circular orbits, the semi-amplitude is $K_{star} = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For a planet in a circular orbit, its period $P$ and orbital radius $a$ are related to the host star's mass $M_{star}$ by $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_{star}}$. This can be used to relate the planet's orbital speed ($v_{pl} = \\frac{2\\pi a}{P}$) to its period.\n\nCombining these (see detailed derivation in thought process), we arrive at the key relationship for the radial velocity semi-amplitude:\n$K_{star} \\propto \\frac{M_{pl} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis formula tells us that for a given star and planet mass, the observable velocity wobble ($K_{star}$) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($P^{1/3}$).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Given Information to Form a Ratio**\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $M_{pl,1} \\approx M_{pl,2}$.\n*   The orbits are circular.\n*   The wavelength shift for planet #1's system is $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n*   The wavelength shift for planet #2's system is $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n\nA crucial point is the orbital inclination, $i$. Since it is not mentioned, we must assume it is the same for both systems for a meaningful comparison. Thus, $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\nNow, let's form a ratio of the $K_{star}$ values for the two systems using the formula from Step 2:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{ \\frac{M_{pl,2} \\sin(i_2)}{M_{star,2}^{2/3} P_2^{1/3}} }{ \\frac{M_{pl,1} \\sin(i_1)}{M_{star,1}^{2/3} P_1^{1/3}} }$\n\nSince $M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$, $M_{pl,1} \\approx M_{pl,2}$, and $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$, all terms cancel out except the periods:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Velocities**\nUsing the relationship from Step 1 and the given wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_{star,2}}{K_{star,1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Ratio of Periods**\nNow we can equate the results from Step 3 and Step 4:\n$1.4 = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.\n\nTo solve for this ratio, first cube both sides of the equation:\n$(1.4)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n$2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\nNow, take the reciprocal to find the desired ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result means that the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. The larger wavelength shift for planet #2 correctly implies a tighter orbit and thus a shorter period.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated value of ~0.3644 is closest to option B.\n\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.96\n\n<<<B>>>"
