    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for a possible decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩ to |1, 0, 0⟩. The decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 2: Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Transition Selection Rules**\nFor a transition from an initial state |n, l, m⟩ to a final state |n', l', m'⟩ to be allowed by the E1 selection rules, the following conditions must be met:\n1.  **Change in Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l):** Δl = l' - l = ±1.\n2.  **Change in Magnetic Quantum Number (m):** Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1.\n3.  **Parity Change:** The parity of the state, given by (-1)<sup>l</sup>, must change. The condition Δl = ±1 automatically ensures a parity change.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the First Transition**\nThe first transition is from the initial state |i⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩ to an intermediate state |k⟩ = |n<sub>k</sub>, l<sub>k</sub>, m<sub>k</sub>⟩.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** The initial state has l=0. Therefore, the intermediate state must have l<sub>k</sub> = 1.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** The initial state has m=0. Therefore, the intermediate state can have m<sub>k</sub> = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   **Change in n:** For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number n must decrease. So, n<sub>k</sub> < 3. The logical intermediate step to reach n=1 is n<sub>k</sub>=2.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2, 1, -1⟩\n*   |2, 1, 0⟩\n*   |2, 1, 1⟩\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Transition**\nThe second transition is from one of the possible intermediate states |k⟩ to the final state |f⟩ = |1, 0, 0⟩. Let's check if this is allowed for all possible |k⟩.\n*   **Initial state:** |k⟩ = |2, 1, m<sub>k</sub>⟩, where m<sub>k</sub> can be -1, 0, or 1.\n*   **Final state:** |f⟩ = |1, 0, 0⟩.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1:** We have l<sub>k</sub> = 1 and l<sub>f</sub> = 0, so Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1:** We have m<sub>f</sub> = 0. Δm = m<sub>f</sub> - m<sub>k</sub> = -m<sub>k</sub>.\n    *   If m<sub>k</sub> = -1, Δm = +1 (Allowed).\n    *   If m<sub>k</sub> = 0, Δm = 0 (Allowed).\n    *   If m<sub>k</sub> = 1, Δm = -1 (Allowed).\nAll three intermediate states can decay to the final state |1, 0, 0⟩.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Transition Routes**\nBased on the analysis, there are three possible decay routes:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\nAll routes listed in the options A, B, C, D are physically possible. The choice depends on the associated probability.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe \"probability\" of a route refers to its branching ratio. Since the second step (|2,1,m<sub>k</sub>⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is the only possible E1 decay channel for the intermediate states, its branching ratio is 1. Therefore, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nWe need to calculate the relative probabilities for the decay from |3,0,0⟩ to each of the three possible intermediate states. The transition rate (and thus probability) is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element:  P ∝ |⟨k| e**r** |i⟩|<sup>2</sup>.\n\nA key point is the symmetry of the initial state |3,0,0⟩. The spherical harmonic Y<sub>0,0</sub> is a constant, meaning the state is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when it decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the available m<sub>k</sub> sublevels of the l<sub>k</sub>=1 state.\n\nLet P(m<sub>k</sub>) be the probability of decaying into the state with magnetic quantum number m<sub>k</sub>. Due to the spherical symmetry:\nP(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n\nSince these three are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1:\nP(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n3 × P(any m<sub>k</sub>) = 1\nP(any m<sub>k</sub>) = 1/3\n\nThus, the probability for the atom to take any specific one of the three routes is 1/3.\n\n**Step 7: Match with the Options**\nLet's check the given options:\nA) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The route is correct, but the probability should be 1/3.\nB) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. The route is correct, but the probability should be 1/3.\nC) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The route is correct, but the probability should be 1/3.\nD) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. Both the transition route and the calculated probability are correct.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- The decay proceeds in two E1 steps: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m<sub>k</sub>⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.\n- Possible intermediate states are m<sub>k</sub> = -1, 0, 1.\n- The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric.\n- Due to symmetry, the probability of decaying to any of the three m<sub>k</sub> states is equal.\n- Total probability is 1, so the probability for each path is 1/3.\n- Option D presents a valid path with the correct probability of 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
