    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons and basic structural fragments.**\n\n*   First, sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (R-C(=O)-CH₃).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to an acetate group (CH₃COO-).\n\n*   **Remaining protons:** The remaining signals (7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, 1.6 ppm) account for 1H + 1H + 3H = 5 protons. This part of the molecule is the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" group attached to the acetate oxygen.\n    *   A **propenyl** group has the formula C₃H₅. The 5 protons match the integration data.\n    *   A **butenyl** group has the formula C₄H₇. This would correspond to 7 protons, which does not match the data.\n*   **Careful Point:** Based on the proton count alone, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. Our choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the propenyl group.**\n\nLet's analyze the remaining signals for the C₃H₅ group.\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   This is a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d). According to the n+1 rule, it must be adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This fits a methyl group on a double bond, `CH₃-CH=`.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This is a single proton (1H) split into a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (causing the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group, causing the quartet). This matches a proton in the `CH₃-CH=CH-` fragment, specifically the one in the middle (`-CH=`).\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):**\n    *   This is a single proton (1H) split into a doublet (d). It must be adjacent to only one other proton. This corresponds to the terminal proton in the `-CH=CH-OAc` fragment. Its chemical shift is far downfield because it is on a carbon atom directly attached to the electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group.\n\n*   **Putting it together:** The signals describe the fragment `CH₃-CH=CH-`. The signal at 1.6 ppm is the CH₃, the signal at 5.5 ppm is the middle CH, and the signal at 7.0 ppm is the terminal CH attached to the oxygen. The structure is confirmed as propenyl acetate.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry (Cis or Trans).**\n\n*   The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J value) between the two protons on the double bond.\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This splitting is caused by its coupling to the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n*   **Careful Point:**\n    *   For vinylic protons in a **trans** configuration, the coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For vinylic protons in a **cis** configuration, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for a **trans** isomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the integration, multiplicity, and coupling constants leads to the identification of the compound as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Integration:** Matches a C₃H₅ (propenyl) group + a CH₃ (acetate) group.\n*   **Splitting:** The dq, d, and d pattern confirms the `CH₃-CH=CH-` connectivity.\n*   **J-Coupling:** The large value of 16.0 Hz confirms a trans configuration for the double bond.\n\nFinal Answer: The unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
