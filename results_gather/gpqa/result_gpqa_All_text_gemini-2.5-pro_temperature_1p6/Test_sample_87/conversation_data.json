    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup.**\n*   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP. This is a protein antigen.\n*   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage. This introduces the antigen to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n*   **Target Location:** The fluorescence is tracked to the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a critical type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), which function as secondary lymphoid organs. This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n*   **Cell Population Studied:** Proliferating cells isolated from the fluorescent Peyer's patches. Antigen presentation in a secondary lymphoid organ triggers the activation and rapid proliferation of specific lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). This proliferation often occurs in a specialized microenvironment called a germinal center.\n*   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells. The variable heavy chain gene (made of V, D, and J segments) encodes the part of the antibody that binds to the antigen.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the significance of each observation.**\n*   The delivery of a protein antigen to a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) simulates an infection and triggers an adaptive immune response.\n*   The presence of proliferating cells indicates that lymphocytes that recognize the rotavirus protein have been activated and are expanding in number. This is characteristic of a germinal center reaction.\n*   The finding of \"high variability\" specifically in the *variable* region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain among this clonal population of proliferating B cells is the most crucial piece of information. This implies a process that actively introduces mutations into this specific gene region *after* the initial B cell receptor has been formed and *after* the B cell has encountered its antigen.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options in the context of the analysis.**\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. While it can be activated by antibodies (which are the product of B cells), complement activation itself does not cause genetic changes or variability in the B cell's antibody genes.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* change the variable region, which determines antigen specificity. The question specifies variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a functional variable region gene by randomly joining V, D, and J gene segments. This process happens in developing B cells in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow) *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a response in mature B cells in a *secondary* lymphoid organ after antigen encounter.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It intentionally introduces a high rate of point mutations into the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. B cells with mutations that increase the affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and proliferate (a process called affinity maturation). This mechanism perfectly explains the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene among a population of proliferating B cells in response to an antigen.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of a proliferative response in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) and the specific finding of high genetic variability in the antigen-binding (variable) region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
