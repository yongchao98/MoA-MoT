    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Decay Process\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V.\n    *   2A represents the initial state (e.g., two nucleons of type A, or a nucleus containing them).\n    *   2B represents the final state heavy particles.\n    *   2E and 2V represent four light particles emitted in the decay.\n*   **Energy Spectrum of E:** The problem states that the total energy spectrum of the two E particles is **continuous**.\n*   **Reason for a Continuous Spectrum:** In any decay, a fixed amount of energy (the Q-value) is released. This energy is distributed among the final state particles. When there are three or more particles in the final state, the energy can be shared among them in a continuous range of ways, as long as total energy and momentum are conserved.\n    *   In this case, the final state consists of the 2B system, the two E particles, and the two V particles. This is a multi-body final state.\n    *   The energy carried by the two E particles can vary. For example, the V particles could carry away a lot of energy, leaving little for the E particles, or they could carry away very little energy, leaving a lot for the E particles. This continuous sharing of energy results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles. This is analogous to the electron energy spectrum in beta decay or double beta decay.\n*   **Endpoint of the Spectrum:** The endpoint (labeled Q in the question) is the maximum possible total energy the two E particles can have. This occurs when the other outgoing particles (2B and 2V) carry away the minimum possible energy.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Variant Decay Process\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M.\n    *   The two V particles are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle M.\n*   **Nature of the New Spectrum:** The final state now consists of the 2B system, the two E particles, and the single M particle.\n    *   This is still a multi-body final state (more than two \"effective\" particles sharing the energy).\n    *   The decay energy will be shared between 2B, 2E, and M. Just like in the original decay, this sharing means the energy of the 2E system is not fixed.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the E particles will remain **continuous**. The shape of the spectrum will be different from the original because the number and nature of the particles sharing the energy have changed, which alters the available phase space.\n*   **Conclusion on Spectrum Shape:** The spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Endpoints of the Two Spectra\n\n*   **Endpoint and Q-value:** The endpoint of the spectrum is determined by the total energy released in the decay that is available as kinetic energy. This is called the Q-value.\n    *   Q-value = (Total Mass of Initial Particles)c² - (Total Mass of Final Particles)c²\n*   **Q-value for the Original Decay (Q_orig):**\n    *   Initial Mass: m(2A)\n    *   Final Mass: m(2B) + m(2E) + m(2V)\n    *   Q_orig = [m(2A) - (m(2B) + 2*m(E) + 2*m(V))]c²\n    *   Here, m(V) is the mass of one V particle. We know from real-world physics (like neutrinos) that such particles have a very small but non-zero mass (m(V) > 0).\n*   **Q-value for the Variant Decay (Q_var):**\n    *   Initial Mass: m(2A)\n    *   Final Mass: m(2B) + m(2E) + m(M)\n    *   The problem explicitly states that M is **massless**, so m(M) = 0.\n    *   Q_var = [m(2A) - (m(2B) + 2*m(E) + 0)]c²\n*   **Comparing the Q-values:**\n    *   Q_var = [m(2A) - m(2B) - 2*m(E)]c²\n    *   Q_orig = [m(2A) - m(2B) - 2*m(E)]c² - 2*m(V)c²\n    *   Substituting the first equation into the second gives: Q_orig = Q_var - 2*m(V)c²\n    *   Or, rearranging for Q_var: Q_var = Q_orig + 2*m(V)c²\n*   **Conclusion on Endpoint:** Since the V particle has mass (m(V) > 0), the term 2*m(V)c² is positive. This means that Q_var > Q_orig. The total kinetic energy available in the variant decay is greater than in the original decay. The extra energy comes from the fact that the rest mass of the two V particles no longer needs to be created. This larger amount of available kinetic energy means that the maximum possible energy for the two E particles—the endpoint of their spectrum—will be higher.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n1.  **Spectrum Shape:** The final state in the variant decay is still a multi-body system (2B, 2E, M), so energy is shared continuously. The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n2.  **Spectrum Endpoint:** The variant decay replaces two massive V particles with one massless M particle. This reduces the total rest mass of the final products, releasing more energy (a higher Q-value) to be distributed as kinetic energy. Therefore, the endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
