    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe question describes the process of pair production where a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to create an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$\n\nWe are asked to find the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) above which this reaction can occur. Gamma-rays with energy exceeding this threshold will interact with the CMB, effectively limiting their ability to travel long distances through the universe.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws and Relativistic Invariance**\n\nThe key principle to solve this problem is the conservation of four-momentum. The square of the total four-momentum of a system, known as the Mandelstam variable 's', is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial reference frames.\n\n*   $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$\n\nHere, $p$ represents the four-momentum vector $p = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where E is energy and $\\vec{p}$ is the three-momentum.\n\n**3. Analyze the System at the Threshold Energy**\n\nThe threshold energy is the absolute minimum energy required for the reaction to happen. This occurs under two conditions:\n1.  The final particles (electron and positron) are created with no kinetic energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. They are essentially created at rest.\n2.  The collision between the initial particles is most efficient, which for this process is a head-on collision.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the invariant mass 's' in the final state (at threshold)**\nIn the center-of-mass frame, at the threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest.\n*   The total energy in the CM frame is just the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron: $E'_{total} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n*   The total momentum in the CM frame is zero: $\\vec{P}'_{total} = 0$.\n*   The invariant $s$ is calculated as: $s = (E'_{total}/c)^2 - |\\vec{P}'_{total}|^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2/c^2 - 0 = (2m_e c^2)^2$. (For simplicity, we often use natural units where c=1, so $s = (2m_e)^2 = 4m_e^2$).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the invariant mass 's' in the initial state (lab frame)**\nLet's consider the initial photons in the lab frame.\n*   High-energy photon: four-momentum $p_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$. Since it's a photon, its mass is zero, so $E_{\\gamma} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}|c$.\n*   CMB photon: four-momentum $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$. Similarly, $E_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{CMB}|c$.\n\nThe invariant $s$ is:\n$s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n*   For any massless particle, the square of its four-momentum is zero: $p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n*   The dot product is $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - c^2(\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n*   $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| |\\vec{p}_{CMB}| \\cos\\theta = (E_{\\gamma}/c)(E_{CMB}/c) \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n*   So, $s = 2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - c^2 \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2} \\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**Step 3: Equate the expressions for 's' and solve for $E_{\\gamma}$**\nBy equating the results from Step 1 and Step 2:\n$4(m_e c^2)^2 = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nSolving for $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n\nTo find the minimum (threshold) energy, $E_{\\gamma, th}$, we need to maximize the denominator. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to a head-on collision ($\\theta=180^\\circ$). The maximum value is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this value in, we get the threshold energy:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we plug in the given physical constants:\n*   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\nCalculate the threshold energy:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511)^2 \\times (10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n**5. Convert the Answer to the Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).\n$E_{\\gamma, th} (\\text{in GeV}) = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
