    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In astrophysics, this is typically expressed as the ratio of the number density of silicon relative to a reference element, usually Hydrogen (H). Therefore, we need to calculate:\nRatio = (n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂\n\n**2. Decode the Abundance Notation:**\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance of element X relative to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n`[X/Y] = log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log₁₀( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n\nA crucial and very useful identity derived from this definition is:\n`[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n\n**3. Analyze Star_1 to find its Silicon Abundance relative to Hydrogen:**\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3` dex\n*   `[Fe/H]₁ = 0` dex\n\nUsing the identity `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`, we can write:\n`[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁`\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n`0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0`\nThis gives us the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_1:\n`[Si/H]₁ = 0.3`\n\n**4. Analyze Star_2 to find its Silicon Abundance relative to Hydrogen:**\nWe are given the following for Star_2:\n*   `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3` dex\n*   `[Mg/H]₂ = 0` dex\n\nUsing the same identity:\n`[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\n\nSubstitute the given values for Star_2:\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂`\nThis gives us the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_2:\n`[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `(n_Si / n_H)₁ / (n_Si / n_H)₂`. Let's take the logarithm of this ratio:\n`log₁₀( Ratio ) = log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₂ )`\n\nNow, let's use the definition of `[Si/H]` for each star:\n*   `[Si/H]₁ = log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n*   `[Si/H]₂ = log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₂ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we get:\n`[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = [ log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) ] - [ log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₂ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) ]`\n`[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₁ ) - log₁₀( (n_Si / n_H)₂ )`\n`[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = log₁₀( Ratio )`\n\nNow, we can substitute the values we found in steps 3 and 4:\n`log₁₀( Ratio ) = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n`log₁₀( Ratio ) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio itself, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of):\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n\nUsing the approximation that `log₁₀(4) ≈ 0.602`, we can see that `10^0.6` is very close to 4. More precisely:\n`Ratio ≈ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation, which can be distracting. These include the masses of the stars, the specific solar abundances for Fe and Mg, and the mention of LTE and the EW method. The problem can be solved purely with the `[X/Y]` values.\n*   **The `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]` Identity:** This relationship is the key to simplifying the problem. Without it, the calculation would be more complex and would appear to require the solar Si/Fe and Mg/Si ratios, which are not given (and not needed, as they cancel out).\n*   **Meaning of the Ratio:** The \"ratio of silicon atoms\" is interpreted as the ratio of their number densities relative to hydrogen, `(n_Si/n_H)`. This is standard practice in stellar astrophysics.\n*   **Logarithm Calculation:** The final step requires calculating `10^0.6`. Having an idea of common logarithm values (e.g., `log₁₀(2) ≈ 0.3`, `log₁₀(4) ≈ 0.6`) is useful for estimating the answer without a calculator.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Determine `[Si/H]₁` from `[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁` -> `0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0` -> `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3`.\n2.  Determine `[Si/H]₂` from `[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂` -> `0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂` -> `[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`.\n3.  The logarithm of the desired ratio is `log₁₀(Ratio) = [Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`.\n4.  The ratio is `10^0.6 ≈ 3.98`.\n5.  This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
