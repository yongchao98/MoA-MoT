    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   **System Components:** We have 13 identical particles.\n*   **Charge of each particle:** `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`e ≈ 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C`). So, `q = 2 * 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204 x 10⁻¹⁹ C`.\n*   **System Configuration:**\n    *   One charge (the 13th one) is fixed at a central point, let's call it P.\n    *   The other 12 charges are constrained to move on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m`, centered at P.\n*   **Goal:** Find the *minimum possible total electrostatic potential energy* of this entire system.\n\n**2. Formulate the Total Potential Energy**\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of every unique pair of charges. We can divide the interactions into two groups:\n\n*   **Group 1 (`U_center_outer`):** The interaction between the central charge at P and each of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n*   **Group 2 (`U_outer_outer`):** The interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere with each other.\n\nThe total energy is the sum: `U_total = U_center_outer + U_outer_outer`.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Energy Component**\n\n*   **`U_center_outer`:**\n    *   The distance between the central charge and any of the 12 outer charges is fixed at `R = 2 m`.\n    *   The potential energy of one such pair is `U_pair = k * q * q / R = k * q² / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k ≈ 8.98755 x 10⁹ N·m²/C²`).\n    *   Since there are 12 such identical pairs, this part of the energy is `U_center_outer = 12 * (k * q² / R)`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This energy component is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere, because their distance to the center is always `R`.\n\n*   **`U_outer_outer`:**\n    *   This is the energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface. The energy is given by `U_outer_outer = Σ (k * q² / r_ij)`, where the sum is over all unique pairs of the 12 outer charges, and `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** To minimize the total energy `U_total`, we need to find the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes `U_outer_outer`. Since the charges are identical and repel each other, they will naturally move to be as far apart from each other as possible.\n\n**4. The Thomson Problem and Minimum Energy Configuration**\n\n*   The problem of finding the lowest energy configuration for `N` identical charges on the surface of a sphere is a famous problem in physics known as the **Thomson Problem**.\n*   For `N = 12`, the proven minimum energy configuration is when the charges are located at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron** inscribed within the sphere.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy**\n\nNow we can write the expression for the total minimum energy (`U_min`):\n\n`U_min = U_center_outer + U_outer_outer_min`\n`U_min = 12 * (k * q² / R) + (Energy of 12 charges in an icosahedral arrangement)`\n\nThe energy term for the icosahedron (`U_outer_outer_min`) can be written as `(k * q² / R) * S₁₂`, where `S₁₂` is a known dimensionless constant representing the sum of `R/r_ij` for all pairs in the icosahedron.\n\n*   `U_outer_outer_min = (k * q² / R) * S₁₂`\n*   The value of `S₁₂` for an icosahedron is approximately `49.165279`.\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n`U_min = 12 * (k * q² / R) + S₁₂ * (k * q² / R)`\n`U_min = (12 + S₁₂) * (k * q² / R)`\n`U_min = (12 + 49.165279) * (k * q² / R)`\n`U_min = 61.165279 * (k * q² / R)`\n\n**6. Substitute Numerical Values and Calculate**\n\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `q = 3.204 x 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `q² ≈ (3.204 x 10⁻¹⁹)² ≈ 10.2656 x 10⁻³⁸ C²`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factor `(k * q² / R)`:\n`(k * q² / R) = ( (8.98755 x 10⁹) * (10.2656 x 10⁻³⁸) ) / 2`\n`(k * q² / R) = (9.2268 x 10⁻²⁸) / 2`\n`(k * q² / R) ≈ 4.6134 x 10⁻²⁸ J`\n\nNow, multiply by the dimensionless factor `61.165279`:\n`U_min ≈ 61.165279 * (4.6134 x 10⁻²⁸ J)`\n`U_min ≈ 282.16 x 10⁻²⁸ J`\n`U_min ≈ 2.8216 x 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated minimum energy is `2.8216 x 10⁻²⁶ J`. Rounding to three decimal places gives `2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
