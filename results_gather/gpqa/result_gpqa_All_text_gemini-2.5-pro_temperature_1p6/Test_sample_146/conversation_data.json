    "This problem requires applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic physics.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Process:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. Typically in such problems, this implies a collision in the center-of-mass frame where the initial total momentum is zero. Therefore, we assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest before annihilation.\n    *   **Final State:** Four new particles are created: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are particle-antiparticle pairs of the same fundamental particle 'A', they all have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   **Process:** Annihilation, where the mass of the initial particles is converted into the mass and kinetic energy of the final particles.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial system is at rest (total initial momentum $\\vec{P}_i = 0$), the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero ($\\vec{P}_f = 0$). This means the four A particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out. By symmetry, the energy released will be distributed equally among the four identical-mass product particles. Therefore, each of the four A particles will have the same kinetic energy and the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy of the system must equal the total final energy of the system. We will use the relativistic energy equation, $E = \\gamma mc^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    *   The proton is at rest, so its energy is its rest energy: $E_p = m_p c^2$.\n    *   The antiproton is assumed to be at rest, so its energy is its rest energy: $E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$.\n    *   The masses are $m_p = m_{\\bar{p}} \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV/c}^2$.\n    *   Total initial energy: $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_i = 2 \\times (938.27 \\text{ MeV}) = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    *   The final state has four particles of mass $m_A$, each moving with speed $v_A$.\n    *   The energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor for particle A.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_f = 4 \\gamma_A (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200 \\gamma_A \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Equate Initial and Final Energies and Solve for Velocity:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the numerical values:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2} \\implies 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Approximation:** The assumption that the \"slowly moving\" antiproton is at rest is crucial and justified because its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its large rest mass energy.\n*   **Symmetry:** The symmetry of the final state (four identical particles) due to zero initial momentum is key to assuming they all have the same speed.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** It is essential to use the full relativistic energy-momentum relations, as the resulting particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Using classical mechanics would yield an incorrect result.\n*   **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** The process is a direct demonstration of $E=mc^2$, where the initial rest mass is converted into the final rest mass plus kinetic energy.\n\nComparing our calculated result ($0.77c$) with the given options, we find it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
