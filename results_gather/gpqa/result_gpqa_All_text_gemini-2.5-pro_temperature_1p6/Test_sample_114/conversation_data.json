    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Initial State and Parameters**\n\n*   We have an electron (e-) and a positron (e+). Their rest mass is the same, denoted by $m_e$.\n*   The electron moves from left to right (let's define this as the +x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   The positron moves from right to left (the -x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n*   The collision happens along the horizontal (x) axis.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Total Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe use the relativistic formulas for energy $E = \\gamma m c^2$ and momentum $p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - (mc)^2} = m c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n*   **Electron (e-)**:\n    *   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum magnitude: $p_e = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{15}$.\n    *   Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_e = (+m_e c \\sqrt{15}, 0)$.\n\n*   **Positron (e+)**:\n    *   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum magnitude: $p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{3}$.\n    *   Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_p = (-m_e c \\sqrt{3}, 0)$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System**:\n    *   Total Energy ($E_{initial}$): Sum of the energies.\n        $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Total Momentum ($\\vec{P}_{initial}$): Vector sum of the momenta.\n        *   x-component: $P_{x, initial} = m_e c \\sqrt{15} - m_e c \\sqrt{3} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n        *   y-component: $P_{y, initial} = 0$.\n\n**3. Describe the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of two photons. For any photon, the energy $E_{ph}$ and momentum magnitude $p_{ph}$ are related by $E_{ph} = p_{ph} c$.\n*   The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Let's call this energy $E_{ph}$. This means their momentum magnitudes are also equal, $p_{ph} = E_{ph} / c$.\n*   One photon moves upper-right. Let's say its direction makes an angle $\\theta$ with the +x axis. Its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_{ph1} = (p_{ph} \\cos\\theta, p_{ph} \\sin\\theta)$.\n*   The other photon moves lower-right. Let's say its direction makes an angle $-\\phi$ with the +x axis. Its momentum vector is $\\vec{p}_{ph2} = (p_{ph} \\cos\\phi, -p_{ph} \\sin\\phi)$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nThe total energy and total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $6 m_e c^2 = E_{ph} + E_{ph} = 2 E_{ph}$\n    *   This gives us the energy of each photon: $E_{ph} = 3 m_e c^2$.\n    *   From this, we find the momentum magnitude of each photon: $p_{ph} = E_{ph} / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (y-component)**:\n    *   The initial y-momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total y-momentum must also be zero.\n    *   $P_{y, final} = p_{ph} \\sin\\theta - p_{ph} \\sin\\phi = 0$.\n    *   This implies $\\sin\\theta = \\sin\\phi$. Since both photons move to the right, we know $0 < \\theta < 90^\\circ$ and $0 < \\phi < 90^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\theta = \\phi$.\n    *   This means the photons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the x-axis. The angle *between* them is $2\\theta$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (x-component)**:\n    *   The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n    *   $P_{x, initial} = P_{x, final}$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = p_{ph} \\cos\\theta + p_{ph} \\cos\\phi$.\n    *   Since $\\theta = \\phi$, this simplifies to: $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_{ph} \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $p_{ph}$ we found into the x-momentum equation.\n\n*   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta$.\n*   Divide both sides by $m_e c$:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$.\n*   Solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n    *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\n*   Using a calculator:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n    *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$.\n*   Find the angle $\\theta$ by taking the inverse cosine:\n    *   $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n*   The question asks for the angle between the two photons, which is $2\\theta$:\n    *   Angle = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is closest to the option 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Direction of Motion:** Correctly assigning a positive momentum to the left-to-right particle (electron) and a negative momentum to the right-to-left particle (positron) is critical.\n2.  **Relativistic Formulas:** Using the correct relativistic formulas for energy and momentum is essential. A common mistake is to use non-relativistic formulas or mix them up.\n3.  **Final State Symmetry:** Recognizing that equal photon energies and zero initial y-momentum implies a symmetric final state (where the angles to the x-axis are equal, $\\theta = \\phi$) simplifies the problem significantly.\n4.  **Angle Definition:** The final calculation is for $\\theta$, which is the angle of one photon with the central axis. The question asks for the total angle *between* the photons, which is $2\\theta$.\n5.  **Vector vs. Scalar:** Momentum is a vector. Conservation applies to each component (x and y) separately. Energy is a scalar, so energies just add up.\n\nBased on the analysis, the calculated angle is approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<C>>>"
