    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the initial reaction.**\n*   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n*   This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride.\n*   The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR.\n*   Let's analyze this anhydride. The single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm suggests highly deshielded and equivalent protons, characteristic of alkene protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups. The value of 7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons in maleic anhydride.\n*   The two 13C NMR peaks also fit this structure: one for the two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm).\n*   The parent dicarboxylic acid must be *cis*-butenedioic acid, also known as maleic acid. Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main reaction and its products.**\n*   The reaction is between maleic anhydride (the dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene).\n*   This is a classic Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically yield two possible stereoisomeric products: the *endo* product and the *exo* product.\n*   According to the *endo rule*, the product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented towards the π-system of the diene is generally the major product (formed faster, kinetically controlled). The other product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable *exo* product.\n*   In this case, the *endo* product will have the anhydride ring tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring, while the *exo* product will have it pointing away.\n*   Therefore, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is calculated as:\n    *   Maleic anhydride: C4H2O3\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: C9H14 (C5H2(CH3)4)\n    *   Product: C4H2O3 + C9H14 = C13H16O3. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the products and assign the 1H NMR signals.**\n*   Both *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry. This simplifies the NMR spectra.\n*   Let's assign the proton signals mentioned in the options based on their chemical environment:\n    *   **Vinylic methyl groups:** Two methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. Their protons are on an alkene, so they will be downfield. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two methyl groups are attached to the saturated bridgehead carbons. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. These are standard alkyl methyl groups and will be upfield. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride bridgehead protons:** These are the two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups, making them significantly deshielded. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene bridge protons:** The CH2 group from the cyclopentadiene ring forms a one-carbon bridge. Its two protons are diastereotopic (one points *syn* towards the double bond, the other points *anti*, away). They would typically be a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling. The problem mentions a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**, which is one of these two protons.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 2D NOESY data to distinguish between the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products.**\n*   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (through-space interaction), typically within 5 Å. A cross-peak indicates such proximity.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n*   Let's visualize the stereochemistry:\n    *   **In the major (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system. The two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are on the same face as the double bond and are therefore spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm).\n    *   **In the minor (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring points away from the bicyclic system. The two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are on the opposite face of the double bond and are therefore far away from the vinylic methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm).\n*   This specific spatial relationship is the key difference. An NOE cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is expected to be strong for the *endo* isomer (major product) and absent or very weak for the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n**Step 5: Match the conclusion with the given options.**\n*   The NOE interaction that uniquely identifies the major (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n*   This corresponds to a cross-peak connecting the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH2 bridge H). This proximity would likely exist in both isomers.\n    *   B) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic Me). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n    *   C) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (CH2 bridge H) and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). In the *endo* isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the *anti* bridge proton. In the *exo* isomer, they are close to the *syn* bridge proton. An interaction would be seen in both, just with different bridge protons. This does not fit the \"present vs. absent\" description as well as option D.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride H). This perfectly matches our analysis. This cross-peak will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent/weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
