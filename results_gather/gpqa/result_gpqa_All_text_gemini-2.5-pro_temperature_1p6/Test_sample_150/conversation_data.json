    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability of obtaining a specific measurement result (0) when measuring an observable `P` on a system in a given state `|ψ⟩`. In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of measuring an observable are its eigenvalues. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is determined by the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information**\n*   **State of the system:** A column matrix `|ψ⟩` = `[-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   **Observable operator:** A matrix `P` =\n    ```\n    [ 0,  1/√2,   0   ]\n    [1/√2,   0,  1/√2 ]\n    [ 0,  1/√2,   0   ]\n    ```\n*   **Measurement outcome of interest:** The value `λ = 0`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Verify that 0 is an eigenvalue of the observable P.**\nThe possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. We need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n`P - λI` =\n```\n[ -λ,  1/√2,   0   ]\n[1/√2,  -λ,  1/√2 ]\n[ 0,  1/√2,  -λ   ]\n```\n\nThe determinant is:\n`det(P - λI) = -λ * ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2) * ((1/√2)(-λ) - 0)`\n`= -λ * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2)`\n`= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2`\n`= -λ³ + λ`\n`= -λ(λ² - 1)`\n`= -λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1)`\n\nSetting the determinant to zero, `-λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\nSince 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n**Step 2: Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\nWe need to solve the equation `(P - 0*I)|v₀⟩ = 0`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` be `[x, y, z]^T`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2) * y = 0` (This is redundant)\n\nThe eigenvector has the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector by setting `x=1`, which gives the unnormalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector for λ = 0.**\nTo find the probability, we need the normalized eigenvector.\nThe squared norm of `[1, 0, -1]^T` is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\nThe norm is `√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability.**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\nwhere `|v⟩` is the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ`.\n\n*   **First, calculate the squared norm of the state vector `|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` = `[-1, 2, 1]` dot `[-1, 2, 1]^T` = `(-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *(Careful Point: The given state `|ψ⟩` is not normalized, so we must include `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` in the denominator of our probability formula.)*\n\n*   **Next, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    The bra vector corresponding to `|v₀⟩` is `⟨v₀| = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]` dot `[-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    `= (1/√2) * (1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√2) * (-1 + 0 - 1)`\n    `= (1/√2) * (-2) = -√2`\n\n*   **Then, find the squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`:**\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = |-√2|² = 2`.\n\n*   **Finally, compute the probability:**\n    `Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 2 / 6 = 1/3`.\n\n**Careful Points Summary**\n1.  Always verify that the desired measurement outcome is an eigenvalue of the operator.\n2.  Eigenvectors for an eigenvalue form a subspace. Any non-zero vector in that subspace will work, but it's crucial to normalize it for the standard probability formula.\n3.  Always check if the initial state vector `|ψ⟩` is normalized. If it is not, you must divide by its squared norm, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`, in the final probability calculation.\n4.  The inner product `⟨v|ψ⟩` involves the conjugate transpose of `|v⟩` (the \"bra\") multiplied by `|ψ⟩` (the \"ket\"). Since the vectors are real, this is equivalent to the dot product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable `P` is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
