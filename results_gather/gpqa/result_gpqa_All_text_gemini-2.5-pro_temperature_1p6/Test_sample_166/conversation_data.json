    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Understand the problem definition**\n\n*   **State:** The Schrödinger cat state is given by `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`.\n*   **Parameters:** We are given `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   **Non-Gaussianity (nG) measure:** The measure is the relative entropy `del_b = [trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))]`. This can be rewritten as `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`, where `S(rho) = -trace(rho*ln(rho))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n*   **Density Matrices:**\n    *   `rho = |psi><psi|` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.\n    *   `tau` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state which has the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the state and calculate its entropy `S(rho)`**\nFirst, we substitute `phi = -pi/4` into the state definition:\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\nThe state becomes `|psi> = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / N = (1 / (sqrt(2) * N)) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`.\nThis is a specific type of cat state known as an \"odd coherent state\".\nThe density matrix `rho` is `|psi><psi|`. Since `|psi>` is a well-defined normalized state vector, it represents a **pure state**.\nA crucial point is that the von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` for any pure state is always zero.\n`S(rho) = -trace(rho*ln(rho)) = 0`.\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to `del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau)`.\nOur task is now to calculate the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the properties of the reference Gaussian state `tau`**\nThe state `tau` must have the same first two statistical moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as our state `rho`.\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = g(sqrt(det V) - 1/2)`, where `V` is the covariance matrix of the state and `g(x) = (x+1)ln(x+1) - xln(x)`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the first and second moments of the state `rho`**\nWe need to compute the expectation values of the annihilation operator `a` and its combinations.\n*   **First moment (mean displacement):** `<d> = <a> = <psi|a|psi>`. For the odd coherent state `(|alpha> - |-alpha>)`, the mean displacement `<a>` is zero. This can be shown by direct calculation. This means the reference Gaussian state `tau` is centered at the origin of phase space.\n*   **Second moments:**\n    *   `<a^2> = <psi|a^2|psi>`. For the odd coherent state, this evaluates to `<a^2> = alpha^2`.\n    *   `<n> = <a_dagger a> = <psi|a_dagger a|psi>`. This is the average photon number. For the odd coherent state, it is given by `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n    \nLet's plug in `alpha = 0.5`:\n*   `<a^2> = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n*   `<n> = (0.5)^2 * coth((0.5)^2) = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`.\n    We can write `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x) = (1 + e^(-2x)) / (1 - e^(-2x))`.\n    So, `<n> = 0.25 * (1 + exp(-2*0.25)) / (1 - exp(-2*0.25)) = 0.25 * (1 + exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5))`.\n    Using `exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653`, we get `<n> ≈ 0.25 * (1.60653 / 0.39347) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Covariance Matrix `V`**\nThe covariance matrix `V` is defined for the quadrature operators `q = (a+a_dag)/sqrt(2)` and `p = (a-a_dag)/(i*sqrt(2))`. Its elements are given by:\n*   `V_qq = <q^2> - <q>^2`\n*   `V_pp = <p^2> - <p>^2`\nSince `<a>=0`, we have `<q>=0` and `<p>=0`. The matrix `V` is also diagonal because `<a^2>` is real. The diagonal elements are:\n*   `V_qq = <q^2> = alpha^2 + <n> + 1/2`\n*   `V_pp = <p^2> = -alpha^2 + <n> + 1/2`\nNow, we calculate the determinant of the covariance matrix, `det V`:\n`det V = V_qq * V_pp = (alpha^2 + <n> + 1/2) * (-alpha^2 + <n> + 1/2) = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - (alpha^2)^2`.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the numerical value of `det V`**\nUsing the values from Step 3:\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `<n> ≈ 1.0207`\n*   `<n> + 1/2 ≈ 1.5207`\n*   `(alpha^2)^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625`\n`det V ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`.\nThe result is remarkably close to 2.25. For the purposes of this problem, we can assume this is an exact value, i.e., `det V = 2.25 = 9/4`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the non-Gaussianity `del_b = S(tau)`**\nNow we use the formula for the entropy of the Gaussian state:\n*   `S(tau) = g(sqrt(det V) - 1/2)`\n*   `sqrt(det V) = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n*   The argument for the function `g` is `1.5 - 0.5 = 1`.\n*   So, `S(tau) = g(1)`.\nLet's evaluate `g(1)`:\n`g(x) = (x+1)ln(x+1) - xln(x)`\n`g(1) = (1+1)ln(1+1) - 1*ln(1)`\n`g(1) = 2*ln(2) - 1*0`\n`g(1) = 2*ln(2)`\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n`2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`.\n\nThis value, `1.3862`, matches option D.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{1.38}}$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
