    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reference Frames**\n\nWe need to consider two inertial reference frames:\n*   **Frame S:** The laboratory frame where the observer is at rest.\n*   **Frame S':** The rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to Frame S (the laboratory) in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (Frame S')**\n\nThe index of refraction `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n*   `n = c / u'`\nThe problem states that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\nTherefore, the speed of light as measured within the rest frame of the glass (Frame S') is:\n*   `u' = c / n = 1 / n`\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\nTo find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S), we must use the Lorentz velocity addition formula. The formula is:\n*   `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `u` is the velocity of the light beam as measured in the laboratory (Frame S). This is the value we want to find.\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the light beam as measured in the moving frame of the glass (Frame S'). We found this in Step 2: `u' = 1/n`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the glass (Frame S') relative to the laboratory (Frame S). This is given as `v`.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as `c = 1`.\n\nThe problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, so `v` and `u'` are both positive, and we use the `+` sign in the numerator.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Known Values and Simplify**\n\nNow, we substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula:\n*   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n*   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n*   `u = [ (1/n + v) * n ] / [ (1 + v/n) * n ]`\n*   `u = ( (1/n)*n + v*n ) / ( 1*n + (v/n)*n )`\n*   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Correct Formula:** It is crucial to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, not the classical one (`u = u' + v`). Classical physics does not apply at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n2.  **Reference Frames:** Clearly defining the observer's frame (S) and the moving medium's frame (S') is essential. `v` is the velocity of S' relative to S, and `u'` is the velocity of light within S'.\n3.  **Speed in the Medium:** Remember that the speed of light *in the medium's rest frame* is `c/n`, not `c`.\n4.  **Given c=1:** The simplification `c=1` makes the algebra much cleaner. The denominator `1 + u'*v/c^2` becomes `1 + u'*v`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe speed of the light beam in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
