    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks us to fill in two blanks in a statement about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant. The first blank deals with its thermodynamic properties, and the second deals with its kinetic properties.\n\n**Part 1: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"**\n\n1.  **What does \"thermodynamically\" mean?**\n    In the context of electrochemistry, the thermodynamic strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A stronger oxidant has a higher (more positive) E°. This value indicates a greater tendency for the species to be reduced, and thus, a greater ability to oxidize something else.\n\n2.  **What are the relevant half-reactions for oxygen reduction?**\n    We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic solution to its potential in acidic solution.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) ; E° = +1.23 V\n    *   **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) ; E° = +0.40 V\n\n3.  **How do the strengths compare?**\n    The standard reduction potential in basic solution (E° = +0.40 V) is significantly lower than in acidic solution (E° = +1.23 V).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for the first blank:**\n    Since the reduction potential is lower in basic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant thermodynamically in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions.\n    *   This allows us to eliminate options B and C, which start with \"stronger\". We are left with options A and D.\n\n**Part 2: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"**\n\n1.  **What does \"kinetically\" mean?**\n    Kinetics refers to the *rate* or speed of a reaction. A kinetically fast reaction has a low activation energy, while a kinetically slow one has a high activation energy. In electrochemistry, a kinetically slow reaction is often said to have a high \"overpotential,\" meaning a significantly more extreme potential than the thermodynamic value is needed to make the reaction happen at a noticeable rate.\n\n2.  **How fast does oxygen reduction occur?**\n    The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a complex process. It requires the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of the strong O=O double bond. This multi-step mechanism has a very high activation energy.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for the second blank:**\n    Because of the high activation energy, the reduction of oxygen is notoriously sluggish or kinetically hindered. This is true in both acidic and basic solutions. Therefore, it is accurate to say that oxygen reacts **slower**. This kinetic limitation is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells, which require expensive catalysts (like platinum) to speed up the reaction.\n    *   This points to \"slower\" as the correct term.\n\n### **Final Combination**\n\n*   **Part 1 Conclusion:** Oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   **Part 2 Conclusion:** Oxygen reacts **slower** kinetically.\n\nCombining these two findings, the correct pair of words is **weaker – slower**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
