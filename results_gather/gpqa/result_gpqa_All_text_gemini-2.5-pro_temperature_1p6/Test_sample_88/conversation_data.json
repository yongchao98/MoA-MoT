    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step reaction and the final NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, caged hydrocarbon with bromine atoms at two bridgehead (tertiary) positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Analysis:** Simple substitution (S_N1 or S_N2) or elimination (E1 or E2) is complex at bridgehead positions. The given product information is crucial.\n    *   **Product 1 IR:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a very strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **Product 1 ¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), and 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14H. The formula for the adamantane skeleton minus two bromines is C₁₀H₁₄. The product contains oxygen and is a ketone, so its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. This matches the NMR integration.\n*   **Identifying Product 1:** The high chemical shift of the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm is highly unusual for an aliphatic ketone. This is characteristic of protons held in the deshielding zone of a carbonyl group due to the molecule's rigid geometry. This spectroscopic data, combined with the known reactivity of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions, points to a rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton. The product is **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). The two protons at 4.79 ppm are the bridgehead protons H-1 and H-7, which are severely deshielded by the magnetic anisotropy of the C=O group at position 4.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃), heated.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is problematic if interpreted as a standard Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which would convert the ketone (Product 1) into an alcohol. The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. Saturated alcohols do not react with ozone under these conditions.\n*   Therefore, the reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ and heat must generate an alkene (Product 2). A plausible pathway is the MPV reduction of the ketone to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), followed by a base- or Lewis-acid-catalyzed dehydration at high temperature to form an alkene.\n*   **Product 2:** The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol would form a double bond, likely between C4 and C5, yielding **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C; 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. Since both carbons of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene are CH groups, the product will be a dialdehyde.\n*   **Product 3:** The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond in the protoadamantane skeleton opens one of the rings to form a larger bicyclic system. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**. This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, making the two aldehyde groups equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR of Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the target proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the **most deshielded hydrogen atom**. In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde), the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically have a chemical shift (δ) of 9-10 ppm. The clause \"excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent\" is included to rule out acidic protons like -OH or -COOH, which are not present in Product 3.\n*   **Analyze the coupling:** We need to determine the splitting pattern for one of the equivalent aldehyde protons (let's call it Hₐ).\n    1.  **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton Hₐ is separated by three bonds from the single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (C3). This proton is H3. This coupling will split the Hₐ signal into a **doublet** (n=1, n+1=2).\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J or ⁵J):** The options provided (e.g., triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets) indicate that there is further splitting. A \"doublet of triplets\" pattern means the signal is first split into a doublet by one proton, and then each line of that doublet is split into a triplet by two other equivalent protons.\n    3.  In the rigid bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, long-range coupling (over 4 or 5 bonds) is common. The aldehyde proton Hₐ can couple to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4).\n    4.  Due to the C₂ symmetry of the molecule, protons on C2 are not equivalent to protons on C4. However, due to the specific flattened chair geometry of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, it's a known phenomenon (or a common trick in advanced problems) that the aldehyde proton can couple almost equally to two non-equivalent protons (e.g., H₂-exo and H₄-exo) via a long-range mechanism. This \"accidental\" magnetic equivalence would cause them to act as a group of two, splitting the signal into a **triplet** (n=2, n+1=3).\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for the aldehyde proton (Hₐ) is split into a **doublet** by the vicinal proton H3 and is further split into a **triplet** by two long-range-coupled protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) triplet: Couples to 2 equivalent protons.\nB) triplet of triplets: Couples to two sets of 2 equivalent protons.\nC) pentet: Couples to 4 equivalent protons.\nD) doublet of triplets: Couples to 1 proton, and to a set of 2 equivalent protons. This matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
