    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalent.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   **Careful Point:** A DBE of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** This two-band pattern in the N-H stretching region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n        *   **Careful Point:** A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide (-CONH-) would also show bands in this region, but the combination with the C=O frequency is crucial.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The position helps identify the type of carbonyl. Amides are usually lower (1650-1690 cm⁻¹). Ketones are around 1715 cm⁻¹. Esters are typically 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but conjugation (like with a benzene ring, as suggested by the DBE) lowers the frequency. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is very reasonable for a conjugated ester.\n    *   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated carbonyl group, most likely an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The adjacent carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3 rule, so n=2). This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The adjacent carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4 rule, so n=3). This confirms the -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. This strongly suggests an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃) or an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃). The signal for an ethyl ester is typically around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but 4.5 ppm is plausible in this specific electronic environment.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n        *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂), which is consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** Aromatic protons.\n        *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons on the benzene ring, meaning it is disubstituted.\n        *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** This symmetrical \"doublet of doublets\" pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n        *   **Chemical Shifts:** The presence of protons at both low (~7.0) and high (~8.0) ends of the aromatic region indicates that the ring is substituted with one electron-donating group (EDG) and one electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The EDG (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield), and the EWG (the ester group, -COOR) deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield). The signal at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the 2 protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Verify with Options**\n    *   **Fragments identified:**\n        1.  Ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to an oxygen.\n        2.  Primary amine (-NH₂).\n        3.  A 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring.\n        4.  An ester carbonyl group (-C=O).\n    *   **Assembly:** Placing these fragments together leads to a single logical structure: an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (-NH₂) are attached in a para arrangement on a benzene ring. This is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   **Check against options:**\n        *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the -CH₂- group of the propionate would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n        *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This has a secondary amide (-NH-), which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and NMR (broad singlet for 2H). Also, it would have a formyl proton signal (~8 ppm). Incorrect.\n        *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound. The NMR would show a more complex pattern for the 4 aromatic protons, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll spectroscopic evidence points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
