    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to deduce the identity of the compounds and ultimately the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 - The Hydrolysis of C**\n*   C + H₂O → A + F + G\n*   This clue states that the hydrolysis of compound C regenerates the initial solid reactant A and produces two different acids: F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid).\n*   The regeneration of A suggests that A is a central and relatively inert component of C (e.g., a metal).\n*   The formation of two different acids, one strong and one weak, from the hydrolysis of the ligands attached to A is a very strong hint. The ligands must contain at least two different non-metal elements.\n*   Let's consider possible pairs of acids:\n    *   Hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and hydrofluoric acid (HF, weak). This is not possible from a single gas B.\n    *   Nitric acid (HNO₃, strong) and nitrous acid (HNO₂, weak). This could arise from ligands derived from a nitrogen oxide gas, like N₂O₄. Hydrolysis of a nitrate/nitrite complex could yield these.\n    *   Chloric acid (HClO₃, strong) and hydrofluoric acid (HF, weak). This pair is an excellent candidate. It would imply that C contains chlorine in a +5 oxidation state and fluorine in a -1 oxidation state. The source of these ligands, gas B, would likely be a chlorine fluoride. Chlorine pentafluoride (ClF₅) is a gas and on hydrolysis with water produces HClO₃ and HF (ClF₅ + 3H₂O → HClO₃ + 5HF).\n    *   Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, strong) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong). This doesn't fit.\n    *   Hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃ from SO₂, weak). This implies ligands from a sulfur chloride gas like SCl₂ or SCl₄.\n\nThe HClO₃/HF pair is chemically very sound and points strongly towards the involvement of chlorine and fluorine.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4 and Identify B, D, and H**\n*   D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Let's consider various pairs of gases that react 1:1 to form a solvent.\n*   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g/l). Phosgene (H) has a boiling point of 8 °C, so it can be a liquid. It is used as a reagent, sometimes in a solvent role. This makes {B, D} = {CO, Cl₂}.\n*   C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). 1,2-dichloroethane (H) is a common solvent. This makes {B, D} = {C₂H₄, Cl₂}.\n*   If we pursue the {CO, Cl₂} path, we can test it against the other clues.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt to Synthesize a Coherent Scenario (Scenario based on CO and Cl₂)**\n*   Let B = CO and D = Cl₂. (The choice is arbitrary, they are interchangeable in clue 4).\n*   From Clue 4: B(CO) + D(Cl₂) → H(COCl₂). Phosgene.\n*   From Clue 1: A(s) + 8B(CO) → C(bright red). A classic reaction is the formation of a metal carbonyl. The stoichiometry of 2Co(s) + 8CO(g) → Co₂(CO)₈(orange-red solid) is very famous. If we consider A to be 2 moles of Co, this fits the 8 equivalents of CO to make one mole of C. So let's hypothesize:\n    *   A = Co (Cobalt)\n    *   B = CO (Carbon Monoxide)\n    *   C = Co₂(CO)₈ (Dicobalt octacarbonyl)\n    *   D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   From Clue 3: C(Co₂(CO)₈) + H₂O → A(Co) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls is complex and does not cleanly regenerate the metal while forming a strong and weak acid in the way described. This scenario fails on Clue 3.\n\n**Step 4: A more careful look at the reaction of C and D to produce E.**\n*   C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous).\n*   Let's use the assignments from the failed scenario above: C=Co₂(CO)₈ and D=Cl₂.\n*   The reaction Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂ is likely to be a chlorination that breaks the complex apart, yielding cobalt chloride (CoCl₂) and carbon monoxide (CO). The CO could then react with the excess chlorine (D).\n*   Reaction: CO + Cl₂ → COCl₂.\n*   So, a possible overall reaction could be: Co₂(CO)₈ + 10Cl₂ → 2CoCl₂ + 8COCl₂.\n*   In this interpretation, the extremely hazardous product E is COCl₂ (Phosgene). The stoichiometry given in Clue 2 (C + 2D -> E) is a simplified representation of a more complex process.\n*   Let's identify E as Phosgene, COCl₂.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E.**\n*   The molecule is E = COCl₂ (Phosgene).\n*   The structure of phosgene is trigonal planar around the central carbon atom. The molecule has a C=O double bond and two C-Cl single bonds.\n*   Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond.\n    *   The molecule has two mirror planes (σᵥ). One is the plane of the molecule itself. The other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle, containing the C₂ axis.\n*   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the clues, several plausible scenarios can be constructed. The one involving metal carbonyl chemistry provides a candidate for the extremely hazardous product E.\n*   A = Co\n*   B = CO\n*   C = Co₂(CO)₈\n*   D = Cl₂\n*   E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\nAlthough this scenario has difficulties with Clue 3, it provides a very strong candidate for E (Phosgene), which is known to be extremely hazardous. The molecular symmetry of phosgene (COCl₂) is C₂v.\nAnother strong candidate for E is ClF₃, which also has C₂v symmetry. The scenario involving Cl and F chemistry provides a better explanation for Clue 3. In either of the most chemically plausible scenarios, the resulting hazardous product E has C₂v symmetry.\n\nThe symmetry options are:\nA) C₂\nB) C₂v\nC) D∞h\nD) D₄h\n\nBased on our analysis, the most likely symmetry for the hazardous product E is C₂v.\n\n<<<B>>>"
