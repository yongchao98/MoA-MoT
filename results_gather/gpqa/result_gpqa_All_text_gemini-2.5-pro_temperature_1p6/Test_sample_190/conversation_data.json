    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   This is a cyclohexanone molecule.\n*   The carbon of the carbonyl group (C=O) is C1.\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   The substituents at C3 and C5 have a 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr or PhCH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The most acidic proton in the starting material is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the primary alcohol. NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2Ph). This is a standard protection of an alcohol as a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The carbonyl group (C=O) at C1 is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. NH4Cl(aq) is a proton source for the workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. A tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (like n-BuLi) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated. The overall effect is the replacement of the original carbonyl group with a C-H bond and formation of a C=C double bond between the former carbonyl carbon (C1) and an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated, and a double bond is formed within the cyclohexyl ring. For example, a double bond could form between C1 and C6. The rest of the molecule is unchanged.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, such as 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The exact position of the newly formed double bond in the ring does not affect the final product's constitution, as it will be hydrogenated in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and hydrogen gas (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleaves benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Transformations on Product 3:**\n    1.  **Reduction of alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen is broken by hydrogen.\n        *   -CH2OCH2Ph → -CH2OH (plus toluene, Ph-CH3, as a byproduct).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we obtain a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2) as substituents. Their relative positions are 1,3, maintained from the starting material. To name this molecule, the carbon attached to the principal functional group (-CH2OH) is C1 of the ring. The isopropyl group is therefore at C3.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This structure retains the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by H2/PdC. Incorrect.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product. All alkenes are reduced, and the benzyl ether is cleaved. Correct.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect understanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming BuLi adds as a nucleophile). Incorrect.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure results from an incorrect understanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming the hydrazone linkage is not removed). Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
