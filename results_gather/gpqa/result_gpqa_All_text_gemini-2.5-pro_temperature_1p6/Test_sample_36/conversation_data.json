    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product E and determine the number of its ¹³C-NMR signals.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO), Ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HS-CH₂-CH₂-SH), and BF₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a cyclic dithioacetal (a 1,3-dithiolane) to protect the aldehyde carbonyl group. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by two sulfur atoms, and the carbonyl carbon is bonded to the two sulfur atoms of the EDT ring.\n*   **Product A:** 2-Ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The original ethyl group of propionaldehyde is attached to the C2 carbon of the dithiolane ring.\n    *   *Careful point:* The hydrogen atom from the aldehyde group remains on the C2 carbon.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and n-butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from molecule A. The proton on the C2 carbon (the one between the two sulfur atoms) is significantly acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the two adjacent sulfur atoms. This is a key step in Umpolung chemistry.\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. This anion is a potent nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the nucleophilic carbanion) and bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br, an electrophile).\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the ethyl group of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 carbon.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-Diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and reagents for deprotection (HgCl₂, H₂O, H⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** The dithioacetal protecting group is removed by hydrolysis, facilitated by the mercury(II) salt which has a high affinity for sulfur. This reaction regenerates the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The C2 carbon becomes a carbonyl carbon. Since it has two ethyl groups attached, the product is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone.\n    *   **Structure of D:** CH₃CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone) and reagents for a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent is prepared in situ.\n*   **Wittig Reagent Formation:**\n    1.  Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane (CH₃CH₂-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃) to form a phosphonium salt: [Ph₃P⁺-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂]Br⁻.\n    2.  BuLi deprotonates the phosphonium salt to form the phosphorus ylide: Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n*   **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone (D) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the 3-pentanone is replaced by the =C(CH₂CH₃)₂ group from the ylide.\n*   **Product E:** The reaction is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The final product E has four ethyl groups attached to a central C=C double bond. Its IUPAC name is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**Step 6: Analysis of ¹³C-NMR signals for Product E**\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, or tetraethylethylene.\n    ```\n        (CH₃CH₂) \\   / (CH₂CH₃)\n                 C=C\n        (CH₃CH₂) /   \\ (CH₂CH₃)\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a center of inversion and multiple C₂ rotation axes. Because of this high degree of symmetry, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the signals:** We only need to consider the unique carbons in one of the ethyl groups and the double bond carbons.\n    1.  **Alkene carbons (C=C):** The two sp² carbons of the double bond are equivalent to each other by symmetry. This accounts for **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** The four methylene carbons (one in each of the four identical ethyl groups) are all chemically equivalent. This accounts for **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** The four methyl carbons (one at the end of each of the four identical ethyl groups) are all chemically equivalent. This accounts for **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:** There are three sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum will show 3 signals.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
