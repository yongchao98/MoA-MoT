    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem describes the relative population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of two stars. The key assumption is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to relate the number of atoms in different energy states to the temperature.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T))\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the excited state (j) and a lower energy state (i), respectively.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of these states.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states (E_j - E_i).\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Given Information**\n\n*   **Two Stars:** We have star_1 with temperature T_1 and star_2 with temperature T_2.\n*   **\"Twice as excited\":** This means the ratio of the population in the excited level to the population in the lower level for star_1 is twice that for star_2. Let's define the population ratio R = N_j / N_i. The problem states that R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n*   **Same atoms and energy levels:** The problem concerns iron atoms and a \"specific energy level\" in both stars. This means that the energy difference `ΔE` and the statistical weights (`g_j`, `g_i`) are the same for the process in both stars.\n*   **Energy Difference (`ΔE`):** The problem gives `ΔE` ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n*   **Boltzmann Constant (`k`):** A crucial observation is that the given energy difference `ΔE` is numerically equal to the value of the Boltzmann constant `k`. This means the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1 K. This is a deliberate simplification.\n    *   `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Write the Boltzmann equation for star_1:**\n    R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1))\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann equation for star_2:**\n    R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2))\n\n3.  **Use the given condition `R_1 = 2 * R_2`:**\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2)) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the equation:**\n    The statistical weight ratio `(g_j / g_i)` is a constant for this specific transition and cancels from both sides.\n    exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2))\n\n5.  **Isolate the constant '2' and rearrange the exponential terms:**\n    2 = exp(-ΔE / (k*T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k*T_2))\n    Using the rule `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n    2 = exp[ (-ΔE / (k*T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k*T_2)) ]\n    2 = exp[ (ΔE / (k*T_2)) - (ΔE / (k*T_1)) ]\n\n6.  **Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / (k*T_2)) - (ΔE / (k*T_1))\n\n7.  **Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:**\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n8.  **Substitute the value `ΔE / k ≈ 1 K`:**\n    ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n9.  **Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:**\n    Find a common denominator, which is T1*T2.\n    1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 / (T1*T2)) - (T_2 / (T1*T2)) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)\n\n10. **Write the final equation:**\n    Substituting the combined fraction back into the equation from step 8 (and dropping the unit 'K' as it is just a multiplier of 1), we get:\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2) ]\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect.\n*   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect.\n*   C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect.\n*   D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - **Correct.** This matches our derived equation.\n\nA final check on the physics: A higher level of excitation in star_1 (`R_1 > R_2`) implies a higher temperature (`T_1 > T_2`). Our final equation, `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)`, requires that `T_1 - T_2` must be positive, since `ln(2)` and `T1*T2` are both positive. This confirms that `T_1 > T_2`, which is physically consistent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
