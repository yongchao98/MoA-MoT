    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the time elapsed for the astronaut.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Information**\n\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the travel time from the perspective of the astronaut on the spacecraft.\n*   **Spacecraft Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c, where 'c' is the speed of light.\n*   **Astronaut's Starting Age:** 22 years.\n*   **Average Alien Lifespan:** 150 solar years.\n*   **Origin:** Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n*   **Destination:** Earth.\n\n**2. Identify the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThis problem is a classic example of **time dilation** in Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Time for a moving observer (the astronaut) passes slower relative to a stationary observer (someone on Earth). The time experienced by the astronaut is called the **proper time (Δt₀)**.\n\n**3. Find Necessary Missing Information**\n\nThe distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is not provided in the question. This is a crucial piece of information.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must use a standard, accepted astronomical value for this distance. The distance to the LMC is known to be approximately **160,000 light-years**. We will use this value for our calculation.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective (Δt).**\nThis is the \"stationary\" observer's time. We use the basic formula: Time = Distance / Speed.\n*   **Distance (d):** 160,000 light-years.\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Δt = (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c)\n    Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (c * 1 year), the unit 'c' cancels out.\n    Δt ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 years\n    Δt ≈ 160,000.02 years\n    *   **Careful Point:** From Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor quantifies the magnitude of time dilation. It's determined by the speed of the object.\n*   **Formula:** γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  First, find v/c: v/c = 0.99999987\n    2.  Next, square it: (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n    3.  Subtract from 1: 1 - (v/c)² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n    4.  Take the square root: √0.00000026 ≈ 0.0005099\n    5.  Finally, find the reciprocal: γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16\n    *   **Careful Point:** This factor shows that for every ~1961 years that pass on Earth, only 1 year passes on the spacecraft.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\nThis is the proper time, which is the time measured on Earth divided by the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Formula:** Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Δt₀ ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\n    Δt₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the duration of the journey as experienced by the astronaut.\n\n**Step D: Final Check and Conclusion**\n*   The calculated travel time for the astronaut is approximately **81.58 years**.\n*   The astronaut starts at age 22. Upon arrival at Earth, their age would be 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years.\n*   This is well within their average lifespan of 150 years, so option (C) is incorrect.\n*   Comparing our calculated value of 81.58 years with the given options, **81 years** is the closest match. The slight difference is likely due to the precise value of the LMC's distance used to create the problem.\n\nTherefore, it will take the astronaut approximately 81 years to reach Earth.\n\n<<<A>>>"
