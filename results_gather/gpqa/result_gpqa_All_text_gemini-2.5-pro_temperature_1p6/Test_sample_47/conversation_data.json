    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product structure.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reactions:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Alpha-bromination of a ketone.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In the presence of an acid or base catalyst (usually present as an impurity or added intentionally), cyclohexanone forms an enol or enolate. This nucleophilic intermediate then attacks the bromine molecule (Br₂).\n    *   **Product 1:** The reaction places a bromine atom on one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Favorskii Rearrangement.\n    *   **Careful Point:** An α-haloketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position) undergoes a characteristic rearrangement in the presence of a strong base. While E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is a possibility, the Favorskii rearrangement is a very common pathway for this specific substrate and reagent combination, and it leads to a product that is compatible with the subsequent reaction steps.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6).\n        b. The resulting enolate anion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate (a strained cyclopropanone fused to a five-membered ring).\n        c. The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n        d. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, opening the strained three-membered ring to form a more stable carbanion. The ring opens to give the more substituted carbanion, which results in a five-membered ring.\n        e. Protonation (during an implied aqueous workup) yields a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 2:** The reaction results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a standard procedure. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃) → Product 4**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Partial reduction of an acid chloride.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄, it is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes and does not proceed to the primary alcohol. This is a key feature of this reagent.\n    *   **Product 4:** The acid chloride is reduced to an aldehyde. The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product, **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**, consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n    ```\n        H   O\n        |  //\n       (C)--C\n      /   \\\n    H₂C-----CH₂\n     |       |\n    H₂C-----CH₂\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds) and the C1-H bond of the ring, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry has consequences for the equivalence of hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** We identify unique hydrogen environments based on their position and relationship to the rest of the molecule and its symmetry.\n\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbon of the ring that bears the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. It is a methine proton alpha to a carbonyl. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2 & C5 Hydrogens:** The symmetry plane makes the C2 and C5 carbons equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two hydrogens. These two geminal hydrogens are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation, making them diastereotopic. One is \"cis\" and the other is \"trans\" to the aldehyde group, so they reside in different chemical environments. The two \"cis\" hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens for these positions. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3 & C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the symmetry plane makes the C3 and C4 carbons equivalent. The two geminal hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens for these positions. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct types:\n    *   1 (from aldehyde) + 1 (from C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
