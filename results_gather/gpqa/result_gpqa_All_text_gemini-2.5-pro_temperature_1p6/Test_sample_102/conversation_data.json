    "**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.**\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This means they are all *meta* to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\nTo synthesize a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring where one of the substituents is an *o,p*-director and the other two are *m*-directors, we must carefully consider the order of reactions. The directing effects of the groups already on the ring will determine the position of the next incoming substituent. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) generally fail on rings that are strongly deactivated, especially by a nitro group.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. (-Br is an *o,p*-director).\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene (major). The substitution is 1,2 or 1,4, not the required 1,3 or 1,5.\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on a nitrated benzene ring is extremely difficult and gives very low yields, if any. The nitro group is a strong deactivator.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to unfavorable directing effects and the failure of the Friedel-Crafts step.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3+). This complex is a strong deactivating, *meta*-directing group. Acylation would be difficult and would occur at the meta position. However, this reaction is not a standard high-yield procedure. Even if it worked to form m-aminoacetophenone, the subsequent bromination step (iv) would be directed by the powerful activating, *o,p*-directing amino group, leading to substitution at positions ortho or para to the amino group, which doesn't match the target's substitution pattern.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is flawed due to problematic reactions and incorrect directing effects for subsequent steps.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is introduced. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so the incoming bromine atom is directed to position 3. This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    *   iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration. The ring now has two substituents: -COCH3 at C1 (*meta*-director) and -Br at C3 (*o,p*-director).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 to its ortho (C2, C4) and para (C6) positions.\n        *   However, the positions ortho and para to the bromine (2, 4, 6) are also ortho and para to the strongly deactivating acetyl group. The arenium ion intermediates for attack at these positions are significantly destabilized.\n        *   Attack at position 5 is meta to both groups. This position avoids the strong deactivation effects from the acetyl group at the ortho/para positions. Therefore, nitration preferentially occurs at position 5, yielding the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify the target molecule and are therefore nonsensical in the context of producing it. It is common in multiple-choice questions for the correct reaction sequence to be a part of a longer, sometimes erroneous list of steps. The first three steps of sequence C provide a viable, high-yield route to the desired product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence contains a correct and high-yield pathway to the target molecule in its first three steps.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...**\n    *   i) Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Aniline\n    *   iii) Benzenediazonium salt\n    *   iv) Benzene (deamination reaction removes the diazonium group and replaces it with -H).\n    *   This sequence of reactions converts benzene back into benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is pointless and incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBy comparing the four options, only option C contains a chemically logical and efficient synthesis for the target compound, which is achieved after the first three steps. The other options fail due to incorrect directing effects, reaction infeasibility (Friedel-Crafts on nitrobenzene), or are nonsensical. Therefore, option C represents the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
