    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Understand the Baseline\nThe question asks for a ratio of neutrino fluxes in two specific energy bands under a hypothetical scenario. To understand the change, we must first understand the normal situation. The Sun produces neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n\nThe key neutrino sources and their energy characteristics are:\n*   **pp neutrinos:** From the initial `p + p -> d + e+ + νe` reaction. They have a continuous energy spectrum up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV).\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos:** From the pp-II branch (`⁷Be + e⁻ -> ⁷Li + νe`). These are mono-energetic, with a major line at **0.861 MeV (861 keV)** and a minor line at a lower energy. The 861 keV line is very intense.\n*   **⁸B neutrinos:** From the pp-III branch (`⁸B -> ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`). They have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO neutrinos:** From the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decays). They have continuous energy spectra with endpoints at ~1.2 MeV and ~1.7 MeV, respectively. Their flux is significant but much lower than the pp or ⁷Be fluxes.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stopped**. This has a single, crucial consequence: the production of **⁸B neutrinos ceases**.\n\nAll other reactions are said to remain as they were. This means:\n*   pp neutrinos are still produced.\n*   The pp-II branch is still active, so **⁷Be neutrinos are still produced**.\n*   The CNO cycle is still active, so **CNO neutrinos are still produced**.\n\nThe 8.5-minute time mentioned is the travel time of neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, meaning we are observing the immediate effect of this change.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Neutrino Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)\nWe need to determine which neutrino sources contribute to the flux in the 700 keV to 800 keV energy range *after* the pp-III branch has stopped.\n*   **pp neutrinos:** Their maximum energy is 420 keV, so they do not contribute.\n*   **⁸B neutrinos:** They have been turned off, so they do not contribute.\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos:** The relevant line is at 861 keV, which is outside this band. They do not contribute.\n*   **CNO neutrinos:** The continuous spectra from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays cover this energy range. They **do** contribute.\n\n**Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of neutrino flux in this band is the CNO cycle.\n`Flux (band 1) = Flux(CNO, 700-800 keV)`\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Neutrino Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)\nNext, we analyze the 800 keV to 900 keV energy range.\n*   **pp neutrinos:** Maximum energy is 420 keV, so they do not contribute.\n*   **⁸B neutrinos:** They have been turned off, so they do not contribute.\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos:** The major line is at **861 keV**, which falls squarely within this band. This provides a very strong, dominant contribution.\n*   **CNO neutrinos:** The continuous spectra from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays also cover this energy range. They **do** contribute, but their flux density is much lower than the integrated flux of the ⁷Be line.\n\n**Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux in this band is the sum of the very strong ⁷Be line flux and the much weaker CNO continuum flux.\n`Flux (band 2) = Flux(⁷Be, 861 keV) + Flux(CNO, 800-900 keV)`\n\n### Step 5: Formulate the Ratio and Compare Magnitudes\nThe ratio we need to calculate is:\n`Ratio = Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2)`\n`Ratio = Flux(CNO, 700-800 keV) / [Flux(⁷Be, 861 keV) + Flux(CNO, 800-900 keV)]`\n\nNow, we must compare the magnitudes of these fluxes based on the Standard Solar Model:\n1.  **Flux(⁷Be, 861 keV):** This is one of the largest components of the solar neutrino flux, with a total value of approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second. All of this flux is concentrated in Band 2.\n2.  **Flux(CNO):** The total flux from the CNO cycle is roughly 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second, about 10 times smaller than the ⁷Be flux. This CNO flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to ~1.7 MeV).\n3.  **Flux(CNO) in each band:** The bands are 100 keV (0.1 MeV) wide. The CNO flux is spread over roughly 1.5 MeV. As a rough order-of-magnitude estimate, the flux in a 100 keV band is a small fraction (~0.1/1.5 ≈ 7%) of the total CNO flux. So, the CNO flux in each band is on the order of 0.07 * (5 x 10⁸) ≈ 3.5 x 10⁷.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Approximate Ratio\nLet's substitute these approximate values into our ratio formula:\n*   **Numerator (Flux in band 1):** ≈ 3.5 x 10⁷\n*   **Denominator (Flux in band 2):** ≈ (5 x 10⁹) + (a value similar to the numerator, ~3.5 x 10⁷).\n\nSince 5 x 10⁹ is more than 100 times larger than 3.5 x 10⁷, we can approximate the denominator as just the ⁷Be flux:\nDenominator ≈ 5 x 10⁹\n\nNow, calculate the final ratio:\n`Ratio ≈ (3.5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) = 3.5 / 500 = 0.007`\n\nThis calculated value of 0.007 is very close to 0.01. The approximations made (like the distribution of CNO flux) can easily account for the small difference. Of the choices provided, 0.01 is the clear and correct order of magnitude.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation Summary:\n*   Flux in Band 1 is solely from the weak CNO continuum.\n*   Flux in Band 2 is dominated by the very strong ⁷Be line.\n*   The ratio of (weak CNO continuum in a small band) / (strong ⁷Be line) is a small number.\n*   Quantitatively, the ratio is on the order of 10⁷ / 10⁹ = 10⁻², which is 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
