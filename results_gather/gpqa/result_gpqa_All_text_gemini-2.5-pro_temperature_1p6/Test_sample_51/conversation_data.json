    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe goal is to find the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N₂/N₁) changes. Specifically, we need to calculate the ratio of (N₂/N₁) for the unspotted star compared to the spotted star.\nFactor = (N₂/N₁)_no_spots / (N₂/N₁)_with_spots\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The population of atomic energy levels in LTE is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\n(N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in energy level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constants for these levels).\n*   E₂ - E₁ = ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Calculation for the Factor**\nLet T_ns be the temperature of the star without spots and T_ws be the effective temperature of the star with spots.\nLet R_ns = (N₂/N₁)_no_spots and R_ws = (N₂/N₁)_with_spots.\n\nR_ns = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)]\nR_ws = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ws)]\n\nThe factor we want is F = R_ns / R_ws. When we divide these two equations, the statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nF = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ns)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_ws)]\nF = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_ns - 1/T_ws) ]\nF = exp[ ΔE/k * (1/T_ws - 1/T_ns) ]\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Temperatures to Use**\nThe problem provides the necessary temperatures:\n*   The effective temperature without spots: **T_ns = 6000 K**\n*   The overall effective temperature with spots: **T_ws = 5500 K**\n\nWe will use these two effective temperatures to represent the two states of the star. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is context that explains *why* the effective temperature drops, but these values are not directly needed for the final calculation of the factor. The problem compares the ratio for the unspotted star (at T_ns) to the ratio that corresponds to the star's overall cooler state (represented by T_ws).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Energy Difference Term (ΔE/k)**\nThe energy difference ΔE is related to the wavelength of the transition λ by the formula ΔE = hc/λ.\nTherefore, the term in the exponent is ΔE/k = hc/(λk).\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n*   h (Planck's constant) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   k (Boltzmann's constant) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   λ (wavelength) = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m\n\nΔE/k = ( (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) ) / ( (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) * (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) )\nΔE/k ≈ (1.9878 x 10⁻²⁵) / (1.99824 x 10⁻³⁰) K\nΔE/k ≈ 99477 K\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Factor**\nNow substitute the values for the temperatures and ΔE/k into the formula for the factor F:\n\nF = exp[ 99477 K * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) ]\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the parentheses:\n(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000)\n= 500 / 33,000,000\n≈ 1.515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\nNow, multiply by ΔE/k:\nExponent = 99477 * (1.515 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 1.507\n\nFinally, calculate the exponential:\nF = exp(1.507) ≈ 4.513\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This matches option C. This result is also consistent with the observation mentioned in the problem: the ratio of populations decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when its effective temperature is lower), so the factor comparing the \"no spot\" case to the \"spot\" case should be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Correct Formula:** Use the Boltzmann equation, not the Saha equation (which is for ionization).\n2.  **Identify Temperatures:** The crucial step is correctly interpreting which temperatures to use. Using the two given effective temperatures (6000K and 5500K) is the most direct interpretation and leads to one of the answers. Calculating the spot temperature is an unnecessary and misleading step.\n3.  **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all units are in SI (meters, Kelvin, Joules, etc.) before performing calculations.\n4.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be careful when simplifying the ratio of exponentials: exp(A)/exp(B) = exp(A-B). A common mistake is getting the signs wrong.\n5.  **Qualitative Check:** The problem states the ratio *decreases* with spots. This means the hotter state (no spots) has a higher ratio. Therefore, the factor (No Spots / With Spots) must be greater than 1. Our answer of ~4.5 confirms this.\n\n<<<C>>>"
