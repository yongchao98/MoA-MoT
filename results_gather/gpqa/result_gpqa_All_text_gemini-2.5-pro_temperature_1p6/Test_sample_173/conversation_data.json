    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   Initial nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: M*c² = 300 GeV.\n    *   Fission products: Two fragments, fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n    *   Rest-mass relation: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n2.  **Calculate the rest-masses of the fragments:**\n    *   We have a system of two equations:\n        1.  m₁ = 2 * m₂\n        2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    *   Substitute equation (1) into (2):\n        (2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n        3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\n        m₂ = 0.33 * M\n    *   Now find m₁:\n        m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n    *   We can now find their rest-mass energies:\n        *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (more massive): E₀₁ = m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n        *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (less massive): E₀₂ = m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission is the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, since it's at rest. The total energy after is the sum of the total energies (rest mass + kinetic) of the two fragments.\n        *   E_initial = M*c²\n        *   E_final = (m₁*c² + T₁) + (m₂*c² + T₂)\n        *   M*c² = (m₁ + m₂)c² + (T₁ + T₂)\n    *   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n        *   Q = T₁ + T₂ = M*c² - (m₁ + m₂)c²\n        *   Q = M*c² - (0.99 * M)c² = 0.01 * M*c²\n        *   Q = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.\n        *   So, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The total momentum of the fragments must also be zero.\n        *   p_initial = 0\n        *   p_final = p₁ + p₂ = 0\n        *   This implies the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n\n### Part 1: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\n1.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** E² = (p*c)² + (m₀*c²)².\n    *   Also, the total energy is E = T + m₀*c².\n    *   Substituting this into the relation: (T + m₀*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m₀*c²)².\n    *   Expanding and simplifying gives: T² + 2*T*m₀*c² = (p*c)².\n2.  **Equate the momenta:**\n    *   Since |p₁| = |p₂|, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)².\n    *   T₁² + 2*T₁*m₁*c² = T₂² + 2*T₂*m₂*c².\n3.  **Solve for T₁:**\n    *   We know T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies into the equation.\n    *   T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99).\n    *   T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁).\n    *   Cancel T₁² from both sides:\n        396*T₁ = 9 - 6*T₁ + 594 - 198*T₁.\n    *   Group the T₁ terms:\n        396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁.\n        396*T₁ + 204*T₁ = 603.\n        600*T₁ = 603.\n    *   T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n    *   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy T₁ = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### Part 2: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁\n\n1.  **Use the Classical Kinetic Energy Formula:** T_classical = p² / (2*m).\n2.  **Equate the momenta:**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, p₁ = p₂ = p.\n    *   From the kinetic energy formula, p² = 2*m₁*T₁_classical and p² = 2*m₂*T₂_classical.\n    *   Therefore: 2*m₁*T₁_classical = 2*m₂*T₂_classical, which simplifies to m₁*T₁_classical = m₂*T₂_classical.\n3.  **Solve for T₁_classical:**\n    *   We have the ratio T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = m₂ / (2*m₂) = 1/2.\n    *   This means T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n    *   We also know the total kinetic energy is T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n    *   Substitute T₂_classical: T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV.\n    *   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n    *   T₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n    *   So, the classically calculated kinetic energy T₁_classical = 1.000 GeV.\n\n### Part 3: Calculate the Difference\n\n1.  **Find the difference between the two values:**\n    *   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical\n    *   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n2.  **Convert the units to MeV:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV,\n    *   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formulas:** The core of the problem lies in knowing when to use relativistic formulas (E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²) and when to use classical ones (T = p²/2m). The \"correct\" value is the relativistic one.\n*   **Conservation Laws are Key:** Both conservation of energy and momentum are essential to solve the problem. Momentum conservation provides the link between the two fragments.\n*   **Q-Value:** The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is derived from the mass defect and is the same value used in both the relativistic and classical calculations.\n*   **Mass Ratios:** The problem gives the mass ratio of the fragments (m₁=2m₂), which is crucial for establishing the relationship between their kinetic energies in the classical approximation.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The final answer needs to be in MeV, so a conversion from GeV is necessary.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and its classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
