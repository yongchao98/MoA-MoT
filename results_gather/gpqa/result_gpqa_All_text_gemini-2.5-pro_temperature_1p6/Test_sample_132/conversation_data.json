    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\nThe solution is made by dissolving two salts in water:\n1.  Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4)\n2.  Sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O)\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of each salt added.\n*   **Molar Mass (Mw) of KH2PO4** = 136.09 g/mol\n*   **Mass of KH2PO4** = 1.00 g\n*   **Moles of KH2PO4** = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves to form K+ and H2PO4-. So, moles of H2PO4- = 0.007348 mol.\n\n*   **Molar Mass (Mw) of Na2HPO4●2H2O** = 177.99 g/mol\n*   **Mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O** = 1.00 g\n*   **Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O** = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to form 2 Na+, HPO4^2-, and 2 H2O. So, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005618 mol.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It's crucial to use the correct molar mass for the hydrated salt (Na2HPO4●2H2O), which includes the two water molecules.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations.**\nThe total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm^3, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n*   **Concentration of H2PO4-**: [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO4^2-**: [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the buffer system and calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\nThe solution contains a conjugate acid-base pair: H2PO4- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). This constitutes a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\nH2PO4⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO4²⁻(aq)\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** For a buffer solution with reasonably high concentrations of the acid and conjugate base, we can assume that their equilibrium concentrations are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n\nSubstitute the concentrations calculated in Step 2:\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * 1.308\n[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-].**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nHPO4²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO4³⁻(aq)\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Use the [H+] calculated from the buffer equilibrium (Step 3) and the concentration of the base component of the buffer [HPO4^2-] (Step 2).\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n*   Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12\n*   [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02809 M\n*   [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809) / (8.11 x 10^-8)\n[PO4^3-] = (5.0562 x 10^-14) / (8.11 x 10^-8)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.2345 x 10^-7 M\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated value is 6.2345 x 10^-7 M. This is closest to option B.\nA) 3.97x10^-7 M\nB) 6.24x10^-7 M\nC) 5.48x10^-7 M\nD) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nThe slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps. Rounding the final answer to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
