    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical System:** The problem describes a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex, which is a coordination complex. We are given its initial stoichiometric concentration and its formation constant (K_f). The complex will be in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (which we'll denote as Y⁴⁻ for simplicity, representing the fully deprotonated form).\n\n2.  **Write the Relevant Chemical Equation:** The question asks for the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions, which are formed when the complex dissociates. Therefore, the relevant equilibrium reaction is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n    The formation reaction is: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ <=> [CaY]²⁻\n    The dissociation reaction is the reverse: [CaY]²⁻ <=> Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Determine the Equilibrium Constant:** The given constant is the formation constant (K_f), also called the stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species     | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|-------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| [CaY]²⁻     | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| Ca²⁺        | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| Y⁴⁻         | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n    *   **Initial:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no free Ca²⁺ or Y⁴⁻ ions are present initially.\n    *   **Change:** As the complex dissociates, its concentration decreases by x, while the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻ each increase by x, based on the 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** The final concentrations are expressed in terms of x.\n\n5.  **Write the Dissociation Constant Expression and Solve for x:**\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Apply an Approximation:** The dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is a very small number. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, x will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02\n    The equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Now, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the square root easier to calculate, we can write 10⁻¹³ as 10 x 10⁻¹⁴:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) * 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Verify the Approximation:** We assumed x << 0.02. Our calculated value is 6.3 x 10⁻⁷, which is indeed much, much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, the approximation was valid.\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **K_f vs. K_d:** Be sure to use the dissociation constant (K_d) for the dissociation reaction. K_d = 1 / K_f.\n*   **Approximation:** The approximation that x is negligible compared to the initial concentration is key to simplifying the calculation. This is justified by the very large value of K_f (or very small value of K_d).\n*   **\"Ideal pH\":** This phrase in the question is a signal to use the given absolute formation constant directly and not to worry about alpha fractions or conditional formation constants, which would be necessary if the pH was specified and not \"ideal\".\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
