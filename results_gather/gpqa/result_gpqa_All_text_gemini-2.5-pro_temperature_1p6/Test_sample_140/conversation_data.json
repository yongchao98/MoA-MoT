    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (Br) and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (d), which is a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3) solvent. NaNH2 is a very strong base (the amide ion, NH2⁻, is the active species) and also a strong nucleophile. This set of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne)**\nThe reaction begins with the amide ion (NH2⁻) acting as a base to abstract a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n*   **Position 2:** This position holds a deuterium (d).\n*   **Position 6:** This position holds a regular hydrogen (H).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuterium from C-2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron (d⁺) from C-2. This is slower than removing a proton due to the **kinetic isotope effect** (the C-D bond is stronger than a C-H bond).\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C-2.\n    3.  This carbanion is unstable and immediately eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. Let's call this **Benzyne I**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C-6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6. This is the faster of the two elimination pathways.\n    2.  A carbanion is formed at C-6.\n    3.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n    4.  The result is a different benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. Crucially, the deuterium atom at C-2 remains on the ring. Let's call this **Benzyne II (3-deuterobenzyne)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe benzyne intermediates are highly reactive and will be attacked by a nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2⁻) in this case. The attack is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne I (from Pathway A)**\n    1.  Benzyne I has a symmetrical triple bond between C-1 and C-2 and contains no deuterium.\n    2.  The NH2⁻ nucleophile can attack either C-1 or C-2 with equal probability.\n    3.  If it attacks C-1, a carbanion forms at C-2, which is then protonated by NH3 to form aniline.\n    4.  If it attacks C-2, a carbanion forms at C-1, which is also protonated to form aniline.\n    5.  Therefore, Pathway A leads to only one product: **Product 1: Aniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to Benzyne II (from Pathway B)**\n    1.  Benzyne II is unsymmetrical. It has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6 and a deuterium atom at C-2.\n    2.  The NH2⁻ nucleophile can attack either C-1 or C-6, leading to different products.\n    3.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group adds to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **Product 2: 2-deuteroaniline**.\n    4.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group adds to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated by NH3. The final product has the -NH2 group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring according to IUPAC rules (starting from the -NH2 group as C-1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **Product 3: 3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible elimination and addition pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  Aniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway B)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
