    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves treating an alkene with mCPBA to form an epoxide, followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening with water to form a diol. This two-step process results in the net **anti-dihydroxylation** of the double bond. We must determine the stereochemical outcome for both starting alkenes.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is symmetrically substituted and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a trans (E)-alkene results in the *threo* diastereomer. For a molecule with two identical chiral centers (like octane-4,5-diol where both chiral carbons are attached to a propyl group and a hydrogen), the *threo* product is a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction 1:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these two enantiomers **Compound A** and **Compound B**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene which is symmetrically substituted and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a cis (Z)-alkene results in the *erythro* diastereomer. For a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the *erythro* product is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this **Compound M**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Compound A:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (chiral)\n2.  **Compound B:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (chiral)\n3.  **Compound M:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso, achiral)\n\n*   **Relationship between the compounds:**\n    *   Compound A and Compound B are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   Compound M is a **diastereomer** of both Compound A and Compound B (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe combined mixture containing compounds A, B, and M is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. A or M vs. B) have different physical properties and will have different retention times, so they can be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like A and B) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The column will separate the mixture into two groups: the racemic pair (A and B) and the meso compound (M).\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers. This allows for their separation.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like A and B) will have different retention times and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M vs. A/B) are always separable.\n    *   **Observation:** All three distinct stereoisomers (A, B, and M) will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
