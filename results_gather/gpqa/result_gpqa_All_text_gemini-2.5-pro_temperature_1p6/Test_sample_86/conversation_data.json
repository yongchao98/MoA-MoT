    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Information Given**\n\n*   **Molecular Framework:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons (C6), so the two substituents together must contain the remaining 2 carbons (C8 - C6 = C2).\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen (like F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Substituents and the Molecule**\n\n*   From the FTIR data, we know the two substituents are a halogen atom (-X) and a group containing both a carbonyl (C=O) and the remaining two carbon atoms.\n*   Let's identify the C2 carbonyl-containing group. The simplest and most common chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**. This group has one carbonyl carbon and one methyl carbon, totaling two carbons.\n*   Therefore, the overall structure of the molecule is a **halo-acetophenone**. The chemical formula is X-C6H4-COCH3. Let's verify the carbon count: 6 carbons in the ring + 2 carbons in the acetyl group = 8 carbons. This is consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   The problem states the ring is \"di-substituted\". This can be ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-). The options provided will help us determine the specific pattern.\n*   Let's predict the 1H NMR for the most symmetrical and easily identifiable isomer: **para-halo-acetophenone (1,4-substitution)**.\n    1.  **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon attached to a carbonyl group (alpha-protons) is typically between 2.1 and 2.6 ppm. So we expect a signal: **~2.3 ppm (3H, s)**.\n    2.  **Aromatic Protons (-C6H4-):** In a para-substituted benzene ring, there are four protons on the ring. Due to the ring's symmetry, there are only two distinct types of protons.\n        *   Two protons are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n        *   Two protons are ortho (adjacent) to the halogen atom.\n        *   These two sets of protons split each other. This typically gives rise to a pattern of two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to two protons (2H). The protons closer to the strongly electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm). So we expect two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5 - 8.5 ppm): **~7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **~7.6 ppm (2H, d)**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum:** A 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm, and two 2H doublets between 7.5 and 8.0 ppm.\n*   **Option A:** `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. The 9.9 ppm peak indicates an aldehyde, which would require a -CH2CHO group. In such a group, the -CH2- and -CHO protons would couple, not appear as singlets. This option is inconsistent.\n*   **Option B:** `6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`. This spectrum does not show signals in the typical downfield region (>7 ppm) expected for aromatic protons adjacent to an acetyl group.\n*   **Option C:** `4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`. This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), which contradicts the compound being an aromatic ring.\n*   **Option D:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` perfectly match the expected pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)` perfectly matches the expected signal for the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option D is an exact match for the predicted spectrum of a para-halo-acetophenone, which satisfies all conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
