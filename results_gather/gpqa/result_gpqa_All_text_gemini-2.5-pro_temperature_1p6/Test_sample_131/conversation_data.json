    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given information**\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Candidate Compounds:**\n    1.  1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    2.  1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    3.  1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n    4.  1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n**Step 2: Check the molecular formula of the candidate compounds**\nAll four compounds are isomers.\n*   Tetramethylbenzene: Benzene ring (C6) + 4 methyl groups (4 x CH3) - 4 hydrogens from the ring. C6H(6-4)(CH3)4 = C6H2C4H12 = C10H14. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers match.\n*   Diethylbenzene: Benzene ring (C6) + 2 ethyl groups (2 x C2H5) - 2 hydrogens from the ring. C6H(6-2)(C2H5)2 = C6H4C4H10 = C10H14. This also matches.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound**\nWe look at the molecular symmetry to find chemically equivalent protons.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They are meta to each other and have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent, giving one **singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique, giving one **singlet (3H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique, giving one **singlet (3H)**.\n        *   This results in three singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), they form an AA' system that often appears as a single sharp peak, which can be interpreted as a **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, giving one **singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent, giving another **singlet (6H)**.\n        *   This results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 6:6, which is **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** All four protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups give a **quartet (4H)** for the -CH2- protons and a **triplet (6H)** for the -CH3 protons. Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated**. This rules out option B.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the mixture based on the predictions**\nThe observed spectrum is a superposition of the spectra of two compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Analyze the aromatic region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers give a single aromatic signal integrating to 2H. Therefore, a 1:1 mixture of any two of them will produce two aromatic signals (provided they have different chemical shifts), each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is 1:1. This observation is consistent with a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Analyze the alkyl region:** The spectrum has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's calculate the expected integration for these signals. The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture of any two isomers is 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   If the signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio, the total number of parts is 2+1+1 = 4.\n    *   The integration for each part is 24H / 4 = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the three signals in the mixture must correspond to integrals of **12H** (2 parts), **6H** (1 part), and **6H** (1 part).\n    *   Now we check which pair of compounds would produce this set of signals: {12H singlet, 6H singlet, 6H singlet}.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {6H singlet, 6H singlet}.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H singlet, 3H singlet, 3H singlet}.\n    *   Combined signals (assuming no overlap): {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals and cannot be combined to form the required {12H, 6H, 6H}. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {12H singlet}.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H singlet, 3H singlet, 3H singlet}.\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. For this to work, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would have to accidentally overlap to create a 6H signal. While possible, this is less likely than a combination that works directly. More importantly, it doesn't match the required set of {12H, 6H, 6H}. It would give {12H, 6H, 6H} only if the two 3H signals overlap, which is chemically unlikely as the environments are very different. So, the signals would be {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **{12H singlet}**.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **{6H singlet, 6H singlet}**.\n    *   Combined signals: {12H singlet, 6H singlet, 6H singlet}. This is exactly three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that accounts for both the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
