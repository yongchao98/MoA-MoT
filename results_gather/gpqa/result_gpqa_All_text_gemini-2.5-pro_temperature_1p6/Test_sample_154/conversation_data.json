    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$. The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the formula:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nSo, for our problem, we need to calculate:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   **The operator $P_z$**: The matrix representation of $P_z$ is given:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **The state of the system $|\\psi\\rangle$**: The system is in a specific state given by the column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Bra Vector and Normalization**\nThe corresponding \"bra\" vector, $\\langle\\psi|$, is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nIt's a good practice to check if the state is normalized, i.e., if $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\nThe state is indeed normalized, so we can proceed with the calculations.\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n*   First, apply the operator $P_z$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Now, pre-multiply by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n*   First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\cdot0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\cdot(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Next, apply the operator $P_z^2$ to the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Finally, pre-multiply by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**Careful Point 2: The role of extra information**\nThe problem provides matrices for $P_x$ and $P_y$, and mentions that the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. While this information is useful for context and can be used for a consistency check (as shown in the thought process, it is consistent), it is not needed for the actual calculation of $\\Delta P_z$ since the explicit form of the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given.\n\n**5. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
