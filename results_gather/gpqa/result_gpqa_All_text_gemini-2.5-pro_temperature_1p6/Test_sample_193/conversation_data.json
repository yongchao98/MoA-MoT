    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the System and its Configurations**\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (microstates) for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Energy of the System**\n*   The energy for any given configuration (S1, S2, S3) is given by the Hamiltonian:\n    `E = -J [ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]`\n*   Here, J is the coupling constant.\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function (Z)**\n*   The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible microstates of the system.\n    `Z = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)`\n*   `β = 1/(kT)`, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each Configuration**\n*   We need to list all 8 possible configurations and calculate the energy for each one. The term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` is the key part of the calculation.\n\n| Configuration (S1, S2, S3) | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | Sum = S1S2+S1S3+S2S3 | Energy (E) = -J * Sum | Boltzmann Factor (e^(-βE)) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| (+1, +1, +1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n| (+1, +1, -1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| (+1, -1, +1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| (-1, +1, +1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| (+1, -1, -1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| (-1, +1, -1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| (-1, -1, +1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | +J | e^(-Jβ) |\n| (-1, -1, -1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | 3 | -3J | e^(3Jβ) |\n\n**5. Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)**\n*   From the table above, we can see that there are only two distinct energy levels.\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E₁ = -3J):**\n    *   This energy level occurs when all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1).\n    *   The configurations are (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is `g₁ = 2`.\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E₂ = +J):**\n    *   This energy level occurs for all other configurations, where two spins are alike and one is different.\n    *   There are 6 such configurations as shown in the table.\n    *   The number of states (degeneracy) for this energy level is `g₂ = 6`.\n\n**6. Sum the Contributions to Find the Partition Function (Z)**\n*   The partition function is the sum of the degeneracies multiplied by their corresponding Boltzmann factors:\n    `Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)`\n*   Substituting the values we found:\n    `Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))`\n*   Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression for the partition function:\n    `Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ)`\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n*   **Counting States:** Ensure all 2³ = 8 configurations are considered.\n*   **Energy Calculation:** Be careful with the signs in the energy formula `E = -J[...]`. A positive sum inside the bracket leads to a negative energy.\n*   **Boltzmann Factor:** The exponent is `-βE`. If `E` is negative (like -3J), the exponent becomes positive (`-β(-3J) = +3Jβ`).\n*   **Degeneracy:** Correctly count how many distinct configurations lead to the same energy value. This is a common source of error.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the partition function is `Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
