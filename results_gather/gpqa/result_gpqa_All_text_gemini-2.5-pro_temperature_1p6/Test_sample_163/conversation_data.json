    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following data for two binary star systems:\n\n*   **System_1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n    *   System is eclipsing.\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (K₁ₐ): 10 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (K₁ₑ): 5 km/s\n\n*   **System_2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n    *   System is eclipsing.\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (K₂ₐ): 15 km/s\n    *   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (K₂ₑ): 10 km/s\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics Formula**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible and their Doppler shifts can be measured), the total mass of the system (M_total = m₁ + m₂) can be determined using a form of Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i) )\n\nwhere:\n*   M_total is the total mass of the system.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Observational Clues**\n\n*   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This is a critical piece of information. Eclipses only occur when the orbital plane of the binary system is aligned very closely with our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. When i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. For an eclipsing binary, we can safely approximate sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n*   **Sinusoidal Radial Velocities:** The mention of \"sinusoidal variations\" indicates that the orbits of the stars are approximately circular (eccentricity, e ≈ 0). The formula above is derived assuming circular orbits.\n\n**4. Set up the Mass Ratio Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2 (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\nLet's write the mass formula for each system:\n\nM_total_1 = (P₁ / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ / sin³(i₁) )\nM_total_2 = (P₂ / (2πG)) * ( (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ / sin³(i₂) )\n\nNow, we form the ratio:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P₁ / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ / sin³(i₁) ) ] / [ (P₂ / (2πG)) * ( (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ / sin³(i₂) ) ]\n\nThe constant term `2πG` cancels out. Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume sin³(i₁) ≈ 1 and sin³(i₂) ≈ 1, so these terms also cancel. The simplified ratio becomes:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P₁ / P₂) * ( (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) / (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) )³\n\n**5. Substitute the Numerical Values**\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n\n*   For System_1: K₁_total = K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   For System_2: K₂_total = K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow substitute all values into the simplified ratio formula. Note that we can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s because we are taking a ratio, and the units will cancel.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (2 years / 1 year) * ( (15 km/s) / (25 km/s) )³\n\n**6. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a decimal to compare with the given options:\n\n54 ÷ 125 = 0.432\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to option C.\n\n*   A) ~ 0.6\n*   B) ~ 1.2\n*   C) ~ 0.4\n*   D) ~ 0.7\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is ~0.4.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Inclination (i):** The \"eclipsing\" nature of the systems is the most important clue, as it allows us to simplify the mass equation by setting sin³(i) ≈ 1. Without this information, we could only determine the minimum mass (M sin³(i)).\n2.  **Eccentricity (e):** The \"sinusoidal\" nature of the velocity curves implies circular orbits (e≈0), validating the use of this specific formula. For eccentric orbits, the velocity curves are non-sinusoidal, and the formula would be more complex.\n3.  **Units:** When calculating a ratio, as long as the units are consistent for each quantity (e.g., both periods in years, both velocities in km/s), the conversion factors cancel out, simplifying the calculation significantly.\n4.  **Total Velocity Amplitude:** The formula for total mass uses the sum of the individual velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂), not the individual values.\n\n<<<C>>>"
