    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂), pyridine (a base), and acetic anhydride ((CH₃CO)₂O).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction results in the bromination of the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic acid has one α-carbon with three hydrogens.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Starting Material (Product 1):** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group reacts with the alcohol to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-CO-O-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-CO-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromide ion (Br⁻) which is a good leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-CO-O-CH₂CH₃). This molecule has an \"active methylene\" group (-CH₂) because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile, -CN, and an ester, -COOEt).\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOEt).\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation.\n        1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion/enolate.\n            NC-CH₂-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n            [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaBr\n        3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The intermediate still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. Since \"excess\" NaH is used, this proton is also removed to form a new carbanion.\n            NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction forms a ring. The ring will consist of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4:**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-CO-O-CH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n**Careful Points for Counting Signals:**\n1.  **Chemical Equivalence:** We need to identify all sets of protons that are in chemically identical environments. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane or axis of symmetry) or by a rapid conformational process.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the ring and the substituents on C1 (assuming free rotation of the ester group). This symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n3.  **Diastereotopic Protons:** Protons on a CH₂ group in a ring are often diastereotopic if there is no local symmetry to make them equivalent. They are in different spatial environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are therefore chemically distinct, giving rise to separate signals. The question explicitly asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, so we must count diastereotopic protons separately.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-O-CH₂) group are enantiotopic. In a standard (achiral) NMR experiment, they are chemically equivalent. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group: 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, at each position, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic. The two axial-like protons (on C2 and C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-like protons (on C2 and C6) are equivalent to each other. This results in **2 distinct signals** from the C2/C6 positions.\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** These positions are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C6 positions, the two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 distinct signals** from the C3/C5 positions.\n    *   **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon is unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic because they have different spatial relationships to the substituents at C1. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from cyclohexane ring: 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 6 signals.*\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n2 signals (from ethyl) + 6 signals (from ring) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
