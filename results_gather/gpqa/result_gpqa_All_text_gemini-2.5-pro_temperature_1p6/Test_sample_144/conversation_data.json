    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the IUPAC Name and Draw the Structure**\n\n    The name of the compound is **6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol**. Let's break it down to determine the structure:\n    *   **undeca**: The parent chain has 11 carbon atoms.\n    *   **-3,7-dien-**: There are two carbon-carbon double bonds, one starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4) and another starting at carbon 7 (between C7 and C8).\n    *   **-5-ol**: There is a hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon 5.\n    *   **6-chloro-**: There is a chlorine (-Cl) atom on carbon 6.\n    *   **9-ethyl-**: There is an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) group on carbon 9.\n    *   **2-methyl-**: There is a methyl (-CH₃) group on carbon 2.\n\n    The numbering of the carbon chain is determined by giving the principal functional groups (double bonds in this case, as per IUPAC rules for dienols) the lowest possible locants. The combination (3,7) for the double bonds is lower than the alternative from the other end (4,8).\n\n    Let's sketch the carbon skeleton and add the substituents and H atoms to satisfy carbon's valency of four.\n\n    `C1 - C2(Me) - C3=C4 - C5(OH) - C6(Cl) - C7=C8 - C9(Et) - C10 - C11`\n\n    The full structure is:\n    `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n2.  **Identify the Stereocenters**\n\n    Stereocenters are points in a molecule that can give rise to stereoisomerism. They can be chiral centers or points of geometric isomerism (like certain double bonds).\n\n    *   **Chiral Centers (Asymmetric Carbons):** A carbon atom is a chiral center if it is bonded to four different groups. We need to examine each sp³ hybridized carbon atom.\n\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (H)\n            2.  A methyl group (-CH₃) from C1 of the main chain\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃) as a substituent\n            4.  The rest of the molecule via C3 (`-CH=CH-...`)\n            Since two of the groups attached to C2 are identical (two methyl groups), **C2 is not a chiral center**. The group at this end is an isopropyl group `(CH₃)₂CH-`.\n\n        *   **C5:** This carbon is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  The `-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂` group (via C4)\n            4.  The `-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)₂` group (via C6)\n            All four groups are different. Therefore, **C5 is a chiral center**.\n\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A chlorine atom (-Cl)\n            3.  The `-CH(OH)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂` group (via C5)\n            4.  The `-CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)₂` group (via C7)\n            All four groups are different. Therefore, **C6 is a chiral center**.\n\n        *   **C9:** This carbon is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (H)\n            2.  An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) from C10 and C11 of the main chain\n            3.  An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) as a substituent\n            4.  The rest of the molecule via C8 (`-...CH=CH-`)\n            Since two of the groups attached to C9 are identical (two ethyl groups), **C9 is not a chiral center**. The group at this end is a diethylmethyl group `(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-`.\n\n    *   **Geometric Isomerism (E/Z Isomerism):** This occurs around a C=C double bond if each carbon of the double bond is attached to two different groups.\n\n        *   **C3=C4 double bond:**\n            *   **C3** is attached to H and a `-CH(CH₃)₂` group (different).\n            *   **C4** is attached to H and a `-CH(OH)-...` group (different).\n            Since both carbons have two different substituents, the **C3=C4 double bond can exhibit E/Z isomerism**.\n\n        *   **C7=C8 double bond:**\n            *   **C7** is attached to H and a `-CH(Cl)-...` group (different).\n            *   **C8** is attached to H and a `-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂` group (different).\n            Since both carbons have two different substituents, the **C7=C8 double bond can exhibit E/Z isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Stereoisomers**\n\n    The total number of stereocenters (n) is the sum of the number of chiral centers and the number of centers of geometric isomerism.\n    *   Number of chiral centers = 2 (at C5 and C6)\n    *   Number of centers of geometric isomerism = 2 (at C3=C4 and C7=C8)\n    *   Total number of stereocenters (n) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n    For a molecule that does not have a plane of symmetry (is not a meso compound), the maximum number of stereoisomers is given by the formula 2ⁿ.\n    The given molecule is unsymmetrical because the two ends are different (`-CH(CH₃)₂` vs. `-CH(CH₂CH₃)₂`). Therefore, no meso compounds are possible, and we can use the formula directly.\n\n    Total number of stereoisomers = 2ⁿ = 2⁴ = 16.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound has 4 stereocenters: two chiral carbons (C5 and C6) and two double bonds capable of E/Z isomerism (C3=C4 and C7=C8). Since the molecule is unsymmetrical, the total number of stereoisomers is 2⁴, which is 16.\n\n<<<D>>>"
