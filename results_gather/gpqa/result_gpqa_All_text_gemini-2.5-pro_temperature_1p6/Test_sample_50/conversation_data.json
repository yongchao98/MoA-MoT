    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physical Setup and the Method of Images\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded conductor is always at zero potential (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces a distribution of surface charges on the sphere. This induced charge distribution ensures that the total electric field inside the sphere is zero and the potential on its surface is zero.\n\nCalculating the potential energy from the interaction between `q` and this complex surface charge distribution is difficult. The **method of images** provides a powerful simplification. It allows us to replace the entire grounded sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at r=R) remains zero, just as it would be for the grounded sphere.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d')\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin, and the charge `q` be on the z-axis at `z = d`. We place the image charge `q'` on the same axis at a position `z = d'`.\n\nThe potential at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere must be zero. The total potential at `P` is the sum of the potentials from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. Let's choose a general point on the surface with spherical coordinates `(R, θ, φ)`. Its distance from `q` is `r_q = sqrt(d^2 + R^2 - 2dR cosθ)` and from `q'` is `r_q' = sqrt(d'^2 + R^2 - 2d'R cosθ)`.\nThe potential `V(R, θ)` on the surface is:\n`V(R, θ) = k * q / r_q + k * q' / r_q' = 0`\n\nWhile solving this general equation works, a simpler approach is to use two specific points on the z-axis, `z=R` and `z=-R`.\n1.  At point `z=R`, the distance to `q` is `d-R` and to `q'` is `R-d'`.\n    `k * q / (d-R) + k * q' / (R-d') = 0` => `q(R-d') = -q'(d-R)`\n2.  At point `z=-R`, the distance to `q` is `d+R` and to `q'` is `R+d'`.\n    `k * q / (d+R) + k * q' / (R+d') = 0` => `q(R+d') = -q'(d+R)`\n\nSolving these two simultaneous equations for `q'` and `d'` gives:\n*   **Image charge position:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nSince `d > R`, it follows that `d' < R`, confirming the image charge is inside the sphere.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Net Potential Energy (U)\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this:\n\n**Method A: Integration of Force**\nThe work done `U` is `W = - ∫ F ⋅ dr`, where `F` is the force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. Using the image method, this force is simply the Coulomb force between `q` and `q'`.\n\n`F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\nThe distance between `q` at position `d` and `q'` at position `d'` is `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\nThe force is attractive, so `F = -k * |q*q'| / (d-d')^2` along the z-axis.\n\nThe calculation of energy by integrating this force from infinity is non-trivial because the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` themselves depend on the position of `q`. A simpler method is preferred.\n\n**Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\nThe energy of a system of charges can be written as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) [q * V_sphere(at d) + ∫ V_sphere(surface) * d(q_induced)]`\n\n*   The potential on the surface of the sphere is `V_sphere(surface) = 0` because it is grounded. So, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_sphere(at d)` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at `z=d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image(at d)`\n\n**Crucial Point:** The factor of `1/2` is essential. It arises because the induced charge is not independent; it is created by `q`. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge builds up from zero. If the induced charge were a fixed, independent charge, the `1/2` would not be present.\n\nNow, let's calculate `V_image(at d)`. This is the potential at `z=d` due to the image charge `q'` at `z=d'`.\nThe distance between them is `d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n`V_image(at d) = k * q' / (d - d')`\nSubstitute the values for `q'` and `d'`:\n`V_image(at d) = k * (-q * R/d) / (d - R^2/d) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_image(at d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image(at d) = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Step 4: Final Check\n*   The energy is negative, which is correct because the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n*   The units are correct: `k*q^2/distance` is energy. Our expression has `R/(d^2-R^2)` which has units of `L/L^2 = 1/L`. So `k*q^2 * (1/L)` is `Energy*L * (1/L) = Energy`.\n*   As `d → ∞`, `U → 0`, which is the correct reference state.\n*   The final expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
