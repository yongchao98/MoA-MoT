    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Structure of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO)**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DBE is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), such as a C=O or C=C bond.\n\n    *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule: t means n=2), suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: d means n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the two CH2 protons are coupled to the single CHO proton.\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are lower (more upfield) than typical benzene (7.26 ppm), indicating the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons, combined with the nitrogen in the molecular formula, points to a primary amino group (-NH2). The amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n    *   **Assemble the Structure:** Putting the fragments together—a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group—the only possible structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify its molecular formula: C6H4(ring) + C(in CH2) + C(in CHO) + NH2 + H(in CH2) + H(in CHO) + H4(ring) = C8H9NO. The structure is consistent with all data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n        *   This is a two-step sequence for converting a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a phenol (Ar-OH).\n        *   Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl): Diazotization. The -NH2 group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n        *   Step 2 (H2O, often with warming): Hydrolysis. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas.\n        *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**. The aldehyde group is unaffected by these conditions.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n        *   The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the α-protons).\n        *   The reagents (KOH, a strong base, and Heat) are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, it will be a self-condensation.\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            3.  **Protonation:** Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n            4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" is crucial. It promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxyl group and an α-proton are removed to form a double bond. This step is highly favorable as it creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde system.\n            *   Addition Product: HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH\n            *   Dehydration leads to: HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(CHO)-Ph-OH\n\n    *   **Identify the Final Product:**\n        *   The structure formed after dehydration is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The double bond is between C2 and C3 of the butenal chain. There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 2 and another at position 4. This matches option C.\n        *   Option D is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. Given the \"Heat\", the reaction will proceed to the more stable condensation product (Option C).\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The sequence of reactions converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
