    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon, which is highly acidic due to being flanked by two ester groups. This forms the resonance-stabilized malonate enolate, [CH(CO₂Me)₂]⁻.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Deprotonation):** NaOEt removes a proton from dimethyl malonate to form the enolate.\n        CH₂(CO₂Me)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ [Na]⁺[CH(CO₂Me)₂]⁻ + EtOH\n    *   **Step 2 (Conjugate Addition):** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n        [CH(CO₂Me)₂]⁻ + p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - [CH-CO₂Me]⁻ (This is a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate).\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product, A.\n        p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - [CH-CO₂Me]⁻ + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂-CO₂Me + EtO⁻\n\n3.  **Structure and Name of Product (A):**\n    *   The structure is (CO₂Me)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups. We can identify a three-carbon chain (propane) backbone: C(from malonate)-C(β from acrylate)-C(α from acrylate).\n    *   Let's number this chain: `(CO₂Me)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)`. The third carbon is attached to the final carboxylate group.\n    *   Following IUPAC rules, the parent acid would be propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   The molecule has a p-tolyl group at position 2. So it is 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid.\n    *   Since all acid groups are methyl esters, the full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. In enamines, the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom is nucleophilic due to resonance.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   This specific type of Michael addition is known as the **Stork enamine synthesis**.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Conjugate Addition):** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** An enolate anion forms on the butenenitrile part, which is then protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone. The piperidine is released as a water-soluble piperidinium salt.\n\n3.  **Structure and Name of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the butanenitrile chain to the cyclohexanone ring. The bond forms between the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring and the C3 (β-carbon) of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The structure is 2-[-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   For naming, we can consider butanenitrile as the parent chain. The substituent is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group at position 3.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in some options, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, describes the enol tautomer. After an acidic workup, the more stable keto form is the major product.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns and Unknowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Base:** KOH.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the Michael donor and the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from MVK in the product is derived from its addition and subsequent protonation. The β-carbon (CH₂) of MVK becomes a saturated CH₂, and the α-carbon (=CH) also becomes a saturated CH₂. This gives the substituent -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃, which is named the \"3-oxobutyl\" group.\n    *   This 3-oxobutyl group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   Therefore, the C-C bond was formed between C2 of the dione ring system and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This implies that the Michael donor must have provided the nucleophilic C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione system.\n\n3.  **Structure of Reactant (C):**\n    *   The reactant (C) must be a compound that can form a nucleophile at what becomes C2 of the product.\n    *   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione has protons at C2 that are very acidic (pKa ≈ 11) because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The base (KOH) readily removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which is an excellent Michael donor.\n    *   Therefore, the reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Correct)\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B, C)\nD) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect A, B)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
