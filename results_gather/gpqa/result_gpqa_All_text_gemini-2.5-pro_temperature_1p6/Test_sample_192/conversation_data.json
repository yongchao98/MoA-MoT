    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**\nThe problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This is describing the number of stars found per unit interval of parallax. In mathematical terms, this is a number density with respect to parallax, which we can write as:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\nwhere `dN` is the number of stars in an infinitesimal parallax range `d(plx)`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Goal**\nWe need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is asking for the number density with respect to distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Parallax and Distance**\nThe fundamental relationship between parallax and distance in astronomy is that they are inversely proportional. For small parallax angles, the relationship is:\n`plx = 1/r`\nThis also means that `r = 1/plx`.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Differential Elements `d(plx)` and `dr`**\nTo convert the density from parallax space to distance space, we need to find the relationship between the differential elements `d(plx)` and `dr`. We can do this by differentiating the expression `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n`d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\nRearranging this gives:\n`d(plx) = - (1/r²) dr`\nWhen we consider the number of stars in a small interval, we are interested in the size (magnitude) of that interval, not its sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. So, we use the absolute value for the relationship between the sizes of the intervals:\n`|d(plx)| = (1/r²) dr`\n\n**Step 5: Convert the Number Density**\nThe number of stars `dN` in a corresponding small range of parallax or distance must be the same.\n`dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\nWe are looking for `dN/dr`, which is the coefficient of `dr` when we express `dN` in terms of `dr`.\nSince the number of stars `dN` must be positive, we can write:\n`dN = |(dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)|`\nSubstitute the relationships from Step 1 and Step 4:\n`dN ∝ |(1/plx^5) * d(plx)|`\n`dN ∝ (1/plx^5) * |d(plx)|`\n`dN ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) dr`\n\n**Step 6: Express Everything in Terms of Distance `r`**\nNow, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression from Step 5.\n`dN ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²) dr`\n`dN ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) dr`\n`dN ∝ r³ dr`\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nFrom the expression `dN ∝ r³ dr`, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`.\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `~ r³`.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Interpreting the given information:** Recognizing \"number of stars varies with parallax\" as a density function `dN/d(plx)` is crucial. It is not a cumulative count or total number.\n2.  **Using the correct physical law:** The relationship `plx = 1/r` is fundamental.\n3.  **Chain Rule / Transformation of Densities:** The key mathematical step is to correctly transform the density from one variable to another. This involves finding the relationship between the differentials `d(plx)` and `dr`.\n4.  **Handling the Negative Sign:** The derivative `d(plx)/dr` is negative. It's important to understand that this reflects the inverse relationship between `r` and `plx`. When calculating the number of objects in a shell, which must be a positive quantity, we use the absolute value of the Jacobian (`|d(plx)/dr|`).\n5.  **Final Substitution:** Ensure all variables from the initial expression (`plx`) are converted to the final desired variable (`r`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
