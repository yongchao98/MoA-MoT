    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of density.**\nDensity (ρ) is a measure of how much mass (M) is contained in a given volume (V). The formula is:\nρ = M / V\nFor a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. Thus, a planet's density depends on both its mass and its radius.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option based on this principle.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is simply a planet with the same properties as Earth.\n    *   Let's use Earth's density as our baseline value. The average density of Earth is approximately **5.5 g/cm³**.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n    *   This option explicitly states the density of the planet.\n    *   The density is **~5.5 g/cm³**, which is the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Same composition\" does not mean \"same density.\" The density of a planet is affected by the compression of its material due to its own gravity.\n    *   This planet is 5 times more massive than Earth. The increased mass leads to a much stronger gravitational force.\n    *   This strong gravity will compress the planet's materials (its iron core and rocky mantle) more tightly than in Earth.\n    *   Greater compression means that the same amount of material occupies a smaller volume.\n    *   Therefore, the overall density of this planet will be **higher than Earth's density** (> 5.5 g/cm³).\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This is the opposite scenario to option (c).\n    *   This planet is less massive than Earth, meaning it has a weaker gravitational force.\n    *   With weaker gravity, there is less compression of the planet's materials.\n    *   Therefore, the overall density of this planet will be **lower than Earth's density** (< 5.5 g/cm³).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the densities of all four options.**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³ (due to high mass and gravitational compression)\n*   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³ (due to low mass and less gravitational compression)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the only one with a density guaranteed to be greater than that of Earth. Therefore, it has the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
