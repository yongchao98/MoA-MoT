    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.\n\n**1. Understand the Premise and the Goal**\n\n*   **Premise:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n*   **Goal:** We want to find the relationship for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". Let's denote this quantity as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax. We need to see how this quantity depends on `plx`.\n\n**2. Relate Number of Stars to Distance**\n\n*   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space with the observer at its center.\n*   Let the radius of this shell be `d` (the distance to the stars in the shell).\n*   Let the thickness of the shell be a very small amount, `dd`.\n*   The volume of this thin spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n*   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the constant number density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² * dd)`\n*   Since `ρ` and `4π` are constants, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d² * dd`.\n\n**3. Introduce Parallax (plx)**\n\n*   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/d` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n*   We can rearrange this to express distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n**4. Relate the Distance Interval (`dd`) to the Parallax Interval (`d(plx)`)**\n\n*   We need to find how the small thickness of the shell (`dd`) relates to a small range of parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by differentiating the expression `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n*   Rearranging this gives us:\n    `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n*   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude of the intervals:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n**5. Combine the Equations to Find the Final Relationship**\n\n*   Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` (from steps 3 and 4) back into the equation for the number of stars `dN` (from step 2).\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n*   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n*   Substitute `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n**6. Isolate the Desired Quantity**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our final equation by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n*   Since `4πρ` is a constant (based on our initial assumption), we have the proportionality:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAssuming a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. This matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The assumption of uniform stellar density (`ρ = constant`) is a simplification. In reality, the density of stars decreases as we move away from the plane of our galaxy.\n*   The relationship `plx = 1/d` is fundamental.\n*   It's crucial to correctly differentiate `d` with respect to `plx` to relate the interval `dd` to `d(plx)`.\n*   Distinguishing between the *cumulative* number of stars (e.g., all stars closer than `d`) and the *differential* number of stars (e.g., stars in a thin shell `dd` at distance `d`) is key. The question asks for the latter, but expressed per unit of parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
