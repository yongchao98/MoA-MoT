    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-X). The question asks to arrange these substances in order of *increasing* yield of the *para*-bromo derivative.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the position of the incoming electrophile (Br+). They can be classified based on their electronic effect (activating/deactivating) and directing effect (ortho/para vs. meta).\n\n*   **Group A (Ortho/Para Directors):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para isomer is generally high.\n    *   **1) -CH3 (Toluene):** Activating, ortho/para director.\n    *   **5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** Activating, ortho/para director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, but an ortho/para director.\n\n*   **Group B (Meta Directors):** These groups direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. The yield of the para (and ortho) isomer is very low.\n    *   **4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, meta director.\n    *   **2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, meta director.\n\n**Step 3: Establish the general order.**\nSince meta-directors produce very little para-product, and ortho/para-directors produce a lot of para-product, any substance from Group B will have a lower para-yield than any substance from Group A.\nThe overall order will be: {Group B members} < {Group A members}.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the substances within Group B (meta-directors).**\nThe substances in this group are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). They all produce mainly the meta isomer, with only trace amounts of the para isomer. The amount of para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, leaving less for the para position.\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n*   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups. It will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   The -COOH group is also a strong deactivator.\n*   The -COOC2H5 group is slightly less deactivating than -COOH because the ethyl group (-C2H5) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly reduces the overall electron-withdrawing pull of the substituent.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 5: Rank the substances within Group A (ortho/para-directors).**\nThe substances in this group are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). The ratio of para to ortho product depends on two main factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects influencing selectivity.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent. A larger substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is larger than the methyl group (-CH3). Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will produce a higher percentage of the para isomer than toluene (1). So, **Yield(1) < Yield(5)**.\n\n*   **Electronic Effect/Selectivity:**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) in chlorobenzene (3) is deactivating due to its inductive effect. Slower reactions (on deactivated rings) are generally more selective. They tend to favor the thermodynamically most stable product, which is the less sterically hindered para isomer. Therefore, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para isomer (around 89% for bromination).\n    *   Alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5) are activating. Faster reactions (on activated rings) are generally less selective. Toluene (1) gives a significant amount of ortho product, with the para yield being around 66%.\n    *   Comparing all three: Toluene (1) is the least selective due to the small size of the -CH3 group. Ethylbenzene (5) is more selective than toluene due to the larger -C2H5 group. Chlorobenzene (3) is highly selective due to its deactivating nature. The high selectivity of chlorobenzene typically results in a higher para yield than for ethylbenzene.\nTherefore, the most plausible order of increasing para-yield is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Combine the rankings.**\nCombine the order from Step 4 and Step 5:\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\nThe final complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
