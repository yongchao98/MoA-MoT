    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** A particle moving at a high speed experiences time dilation. Its lifetime in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) is longer than its proper lifetime (the lifetime in its own rest frame).\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The total energy ($E$), rest mass ($m_0$), and momentum ($p$) of a particle are related by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, connects energy and rest mass by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of a population of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The number of particles surviving after a time $t$ is $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime in the observed frame. The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ before decaying is described by a similar exponential law related to the mean decay length, $L$.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Target Variable**\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$: $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Observation requirement: At least 30% of decays must be observed.\n*   **To Find:**\n    *   The minimum required resolution, which we will treat as a distance, $d_{res}$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy in the lab frame to its rest mass energy.\n$E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L$) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is given by $L = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's speed and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\nFirst, we find the lab frame lifetime, $\\tau$, using time dilation:\n$\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nThen, the mean decay length is $L = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n\nA more direct way to calculate this is using the formula $L = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}\\tau_0 c$.\nWe find the momentum, $p$, from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.784 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow calculate $L$:\n$L = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c\\tau_0$\n$L = \\frac{26.784}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L \\approx 7.8545 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n$L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Apply the Observation Condition**\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n*   In a detector like a bubble chamber, a decay is \"observed\" if the particle's track is long enough to be resolved. This means the particle's path length, $d$, must be greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n*   The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is given by $P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/L}$.\n*   We require this fraction to be at least 30% (or 0.3).\n    $e^{-d_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\n**Step D: Solve for the Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nWe solve the inequality for $d_{res}$:\n$- \\frac{d_{res}}{L} \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$\\frac{d_{res}}{L} \\le -\\ln(0.30)$\n$\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\nSo, $\\frac{d_{res}}{L} \\le 1.204$\n$d_{res} \\le 1.204 \\times L$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This is often interpreted as the coarsest (i.e., largest) acceptable resolution. Therefore, we are looking for the maximum value of $d_{res}$ that satisfies the condition.\n$d_{res} = 1.204 \\times L = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nOur calculated value for the required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nOption A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically the closest to our calculated value. The small discrepancy (around 8-9%) is likely due to rounding of the initial values in the problem statement or a slight inconsistency in the provided options. Given the choices, option A is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
