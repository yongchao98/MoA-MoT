    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The most common cause is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), but other sources of chirality like axial chirality also exist.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls are two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.\n*   **Substituents:** The ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings) are all substituted with large groups: two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   Due to the large size of these ortho-substituents, there is significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which leads to **axial chirality**.\n    *   The molecule is \"locked\" in a twisted conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane.\n    *   To be chiral, this locked conformation must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Let's check for symmetry. Imagine one ring is in the foreground and the other in the background. The arrangement of substituents (-COOCH₃ at 2, -NO₂ at 6 on one ring, and -COOCH₃ at 2', -NO₂ at 6' on the other) ensures that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. Its mirror image will be non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   We need to look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2):\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to the C2 carbon are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses symmetry. There is a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two -COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (axial chirality).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the moieties that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
