    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze the Clues**\n\nWe are given a series of clues about a substance X and its reactions. Let's analyze them one by one to identify the substances involved.\n\n*   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n    *   This suggests X is a labeled compound, likely containing Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a common heavy isotope used in chemical synthesis.\n\n*   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W.**\n    *   A violent reaction with a liquid points towards a highly reactive substance. Liquid Y could be water (H₂O). The reaction produces a gas W.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n    *   Let's check common gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Yes, this is a perfect match.\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This fits but is less likely given the context.\n        *   ¹²CO (Carbon Monoxide): C has 6p, 6n; O has 8p, 8n. Total: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Also a fit, but less likely.\n    *   The most logical conclusion, combined with Clue 1, is that the heavy isotope in X is Deuterium (D), and the gas W is Deuterium gas (D₂). For X to release D₂ upon reaction with a liquid Y, Y must also be a source of deuterium, pointing to Y being heavy water (D₂O).\n\n*   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.**\n    *   The reaction between X and Y (now likely D₂O) produces an insoluble solid, G.\n\n*   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to 277 K. Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   This means the precipitate G is a deuterated hydrate (a compound containing D₂O in its crystal structure) which releases D₂O upon heating.\n\n*   **Clue 6 & 7: X (and its analog) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The product of its reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.**\n    *   Common deuterated reagents include NaBD₄ (sodium borodeuteride) and LiAlD₄ (lithium aluminum deuteride). Their non-deuterated analogs (NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄) are workhorse reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   A keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH (containing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, 3 oxygen atoms total).\n    *   Let's test our candidates:\n        *   **NaBD₄:** This is a mild reducing agent. It reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be R-CD(OH)-COOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms. This does not fit.\n        *   **LiAlD₄:** This is a very powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. The product would be R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH). After an aqueous workup to protonate the alkoxides, the final structure is a diol, which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This is a perfect fit.\n\n**Step 2: Identify X and the Reaction**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can confidently identify the substances:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water, **D₂O**.\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**.\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water, **D₂O**.\n\nThe reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4 D₂ (gas)`\nHeating the precipitate: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`\nThis set of reactions and substances fits every clue provided.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements in X:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n\nThe phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" directs us to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements found in the formula unit of X.\n\n*   The formula LiAlD₄ contains **one atom** of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n*   The formula LiAlD₄ contains **four atoms** of the lightest element (Hydrogen), present as the isotope Deuterium (D).\n\nWe will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for the calculation.\n*   Mass of the common isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = **27**.\n*   Mass of the Deuterium isotope (²H or D) = **2**.\n\nCalculation:\nCumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\nCumulative Mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2)\nCumulative Mass = 27 + 8\nCumulative Mass = **35**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
