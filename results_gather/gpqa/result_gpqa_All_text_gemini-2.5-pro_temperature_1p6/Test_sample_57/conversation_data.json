    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed physical theories does not require **regularization at high energies**.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of \"Regularization at High Energies\"**\nIn physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations for interactions between particles often involve integrals over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles in loops (Feynman diagrams). These integrals frequently diverge when considering contributions from infinitely high energies (or, equivalently, infinitely short distances). This is known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\".\n\n**Regularization** is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory by introducing a new parameter, known as a \"regulator\" or \"cutoff\" (like a maximum energy scale, Î›), to make the divergent integrals finite. After the calculation is done, another process called **renormalization** is used to absorb the cutoff-dependent parts into the fundamental constants of the theory (like mass and charge), leading to finite and physically meaningful predictions.\n\nA theory that \"never requires regularization at high energies\" would be one that is inherently free from these UV divergences. Its calculations would yield finite results from the outset, without needing an artificial cutoff.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Options\n\n**A) Classical Electrodynamics**\n*   **What it is:** The classical theory of electric and magnetic fields and their interaction with charged matter, described by Maxwell's equations.\n*   **High-Energy Problem:** While it's not a quantum field theory and doesn't have loop diagrams, it does have a famous high-energy/short-distance problem. If you model an electron as a point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its \"self-energy\") is infinite. This divergence occurs as the radius of the charge approaches zero. To solve this, one might impose a finite \"classical electron radius,\" which acts as a cutoff. Therefore, even in its classical form, the theory has a pathology at high energies that requires an ad-hoc fix, which is a form of regularization.\n\n**C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**\n*   **What it is:** The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, which governs the interactions of quarks and gluons. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n*   **Requirement for Regularization:** As a QFT, calculations in QCD involve loop diagrams (e.g., gluon self-interactions, quark loops). These loops lead to UV divergences. Therefore, QCD *critically requires* regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions. It is a classic example of a theory where regularization is essential.\n\n**D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**\n*   **What it is:** The quantum field theory of electromagnetism, describing how light and matter interact. It is the quantum version of classical electrodynamics.\n*   **Requirement for Regularization:** Like QCD, QED is a quantum field theory. When calculating physical quantities beyond the simplest approximations (i.e., including loop diagrams), one encounters UV divergences. Famous examples include the calculation of the electron's self-energy and vacuum polarization. QED was the first theory where regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to obtain incredibly precise predictions. It absolutely requires regularization.\n\n**B) Superstring Theory**\n*   **What it is:** A theoretical framework aiming to be a \"theory of everything\" by unifying all fundamental forces and particles. Its core postulate is that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point-like particles but one-dimensional vibrating \"strings\".\n*   **Requirement for Regularization:** A primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be **UV-finite**. The key difference from point-particle theories (like QED and QCD) is that strings are extended objects. Interactions are not points in spacetime but are \"smeared out\" over a region. This smearing naturally smooths out the high-energy behavior that leads to divergences in QFT. The finite length of the string effectively provides a natural physical cutoff, eliminating the need for the artificial process of regularization. Loop diagrams in string theory (which correspond to smooth world-sheet topologies, like a torus) yield finite results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options A, C, and D all describe theories that suffer from divergences at high energies/short distances and require some form of regularization or cutoff to be dealt with.\n*   Superstring Theory, by its fundamental construction, is believed to be free of these ultraviolet divergences, thus not requiring regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
