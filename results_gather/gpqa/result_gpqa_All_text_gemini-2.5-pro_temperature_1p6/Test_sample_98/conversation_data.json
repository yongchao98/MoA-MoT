    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. We can check the four options, and indeed, all of them are carboxylic acids. Therefore, the FTIR data is consistent with all four possible answers, and we must rely on the 1H NMR data for identification.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This information tells us that the molecule contains no protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, so this is consistent with all choices.\n*   **Complex Splitting Patterns:** This is the key information for distinguishing between the structures. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the (n+1) rule. A complex splitting pattern like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   A **doublet (d)** is caused by coupling to **1** neighboring proton.\n    *   A **triplet (t)** is caused by coupling to **2** neighboring protons.\n    *   A **quartet (q)** is caused by coupling to **3** neighboring protons.\n*   **Requirement for a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton showing this pattern must be a methine (`-CH-`) group coupled to three distinct, adjacent groups: a `CH` group (1 proton), a `CH2` group (2 protons), and a `CH3` group (3 protons).\n*   **Requirement for a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton showing this pattern must be a methine (`-CH-`) group coupled to three distinct, adjacent groups: a `CH` group (1 proton), a `CH2` group (2 protons), and another, chemically non-equivalent `CH2` group (2 protons).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe will now analyze the structure of each option to see if it contains protons that would produce the observed `dtq` and `dtt` splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH** -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid\nStructure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n*   Let's look for a proton with three different sets of neighbors.\n*   The H on C4 is adjacent to a `CH3` and a `CH`. It gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   The H on C3 is adjacent to a `CH` and a `CH2`. It gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   This structure does not contain any proton that would give a `dtq` or `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid\nStructure: `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n*   The H on C3 is adjacent to a `CH2` (from the main chain), a `CH` (at C2), and a `CH2` (from the ethyl group). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   However, to get a `dtq`, a proton needs to be adjacent to a `CH3` group. No methine (`CH`) proton in this molecule is directly bonded to a carbon which has a methyl (`CH3`) group attached. Therefore, this structure lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH** -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid\nStructure: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\nLet's analyze the methine (`-CH-`) protons:\n*   **Proton at C4:** This `CH` group is bonded to:\n    1.  The `CH3` group at the end of the chain (3 protons -> **quartet**).\n    2.  The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton -> **doublet**).\n    3.  The `CH2` of the ethyl substituent at C4 (2 protons -> **triplet**).\n    This proton is coupled to three different groups of neighbors and will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of NMR data.\n*   **Proton at C3:** This `CH` group is bonded to:\n    1.  The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton -> **doublet**).\n    2.  The `CH2` group at C2 (2 protons -> **triplet**).\n    3.  The `CH2` of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2 protons -> **triplet**).\n    This proton is also coupled to three different groups of neighbors. The two `CH2` groups are chemically non-equivalent. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second piece of NMR data.\n*   This structure uniquely provides protons that generate both of the complex signals described in the problem.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH** -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid\nStructure: `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n*   The H on C3 is adjacent to a `CH2` and a `CH`. It gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   The H on C2 is adjacent to only one `CH` group. It gives a doublet (d).\n*   This structure does not contain any proton that would give a `dtq` or `dtt` signal.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the splitting patterns required by the 1H NMR data, only structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
