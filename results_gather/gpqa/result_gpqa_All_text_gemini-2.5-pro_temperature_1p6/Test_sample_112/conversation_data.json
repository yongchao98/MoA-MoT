    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A broad peak in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimers formed by carboxylic acids. This peak often overlaps with C-H stretches which also appear around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region. A strong absorption between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. An alkene functional group is present in the molecule.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the presence of both a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) and an **alkene** group (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which is consistent with the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** The molecule contains a **C=C double bond**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This fragment is a key piece of evidence. We can calculate the mass of a potential fragment: The fragment ion [COOH]⁺ has a mass of 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45. This is a very common and characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** This provides strong supporting evidence for the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have definitively identified two functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2.  An alkene (C=C)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the proposed formulas. A crucial tool is the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1, which for a CₓHᵧO₂ formula simplifies to DoU = x - (y/2) + 1.\n\nOur molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C in the alkene.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens.\n    *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 is not sufficient to accommodate both a C=O bond and a C=C bond. This formula represents a saturated carboxylic acid (or ester). **Incorrect.**\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens.\n    *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is perfectly consistent with the presence of one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the alkene). This formula fits all the spectral evidence. **Correct.**\n*   **D) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe evidence from all three characterisation techniques points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of at least 2. Only the formula C6H10O2 meets all these criteria.\n\n<<<C>>>"
