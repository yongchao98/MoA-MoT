    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the intensity of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ to M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. Chlorine has two major isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which gives rise to this pattern. The molecule with ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156, and the molecule with ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas and weights of the options.\n    *   All four options (4-chlorobenzoic acid, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, Phenyl chloroformate, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   The molecular weight with ³⁷Cl is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 37 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    *   Thus, all four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad Peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is a classic, unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For an aromatic carboxylic acid, this peak is expected around 1720-1680 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch (the \"hairy beard\") and a C=O stretch is definitive for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a -COOH group. **Consistent.**\n    *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a -COOH group. **Consistent.**\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride derivative. It has a C=O group but lacks the O-H group, so it would not have the broad 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ peak. **Inconsistent.**\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This molecule has a phenolic O-H (which is broad, but usually not as broad as a carboxylic acid's) and an aldehyde C=O. The key evidence is the extremely broad O-H stretch, which points much more strongly to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, this option is less likely.\n*   The IR data effectively narrows down the possibilities to A and B.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal with a chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it has no adjacent protons to couple with. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from IR that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-9 ppm).\n    *   **Integration:** The total integration in this region is 2H + 2H = 4H, meaning there are four protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern shows two doublets (d). A simple pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, where each integrates to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In such a ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons due to symmetry. Each set consists of two protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n*   **Careful Point:** The symmetry of the substitution on the benzene ring is the key to differentiating the isomers.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. It would have two sets of equivalent protons, leading to two signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the data. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and correspond to the 8.02 ppm signal. The protons ortho to the chlorine atom are less deshielded and correspond to the 7.72 ppm signal.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, all four aromatic protons would be chemically different. This would result in a more complex spectrum, likely with four distinct signals (e.g., multiplets), each integrating to 1H. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the evidence:\n1.  **MS** confirmed the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n2.  **IR** identified the compound as a carboxylic acid, ruling out C and making D unlikely.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirmed the carboxylic acid group and, most importantly, the ¹H NMR splitting pattern revealed a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly 4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option A) fits all three pieces of spectral data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
