    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information\nFirst, we need to list all the information given in the problem and identify what we need to calculate.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   There are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3.\n    *   They are in circular orbits around the same star.\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n    *   The albedo (A) is the same for all planets (A = 0.3).\n    *   **Distractor Information:** The mass ratios (M1/M2 ≈ 1.15 and M2/M3 ≈ 1.35) and the discovery method (TTV) are not needed for this calculation, as the orbital period in this context depends on the distance from the star, not the planet's mass (assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass).\n\n*   **To Find:**\n    *   The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is the ratio P3 / P1.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n    `T_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a^2)]^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   L is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `a` is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Equations and Formulate a Plan\n\n*   **Simplifying the Temperature Equation:**\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, the star's luminosity (L) is constant. The albedo (A) is also given as being the same for all three planets. The values 16, π, and σ are universal constants. Therefore, all these terms can be treated as a single constant (let's call it C).\n    `T_eq = [C / a^2]^(1/4) = C^(1/4) * a^(-2/4) = C' * a^(-1/2)`\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance: `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`.\n    From this relationship, we can write a ratio:\n    `(T_i / T_j) = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)`\n    Squaring both sides gives us a relationship for the ratio of orbital distances:\n    `(a_j / a_i) = (T_i / T_j)^2`\n\n*   **Simplifying Kepler's Third Law:**\n    From `P^2 ∝ a^3`, we can write a ratio for the periods:\n    `(P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3`\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    `(P_i / P_j) = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)`\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratios of the orbital distances.\n    2.  Combine these distance ratios to find the overall distance ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 (`a3 / a1`).\n    3.  Use this overall distance ratio and Kepler's Third Law to find the orbital period ratio (`P3 / P1`).\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances `a2 / a1`:**\n    We use the relationship `(a_j / a_i) = (T_i / T_j)^2`.\n    `a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 ≈ (1.4)^2 = 1.96`\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of orbital distances `a3 / a2`:**\n    Similarly,\n    `a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 ≈ (2.3)^2 = 5.29`\n\n3.  **Find the overall orbital distance ratio `a3 / a1`:**\n    We can find the ratio of the outermost planet's distance to the innermost one by multiplying the individual ratios:\n    `a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684`\n\n4.  **Find the orbital period ratio `P3 / P1`:**\n    Now we use Kepler's Third Law: `(P_i / P_j) = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)`.\n    `P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n    This can be calculated as `(10.3684)^(1.5)`, which is `10.3684 * sqrt(10.3684)`.\n    *   `sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 3.2199...`\n    *   `P3 / P1 ≈ 10.3684 * 3.2199 ≈ 33.386...`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the factor is approximately **33.4**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Check and Conclusion\n\nLet's quickly check this using a combined formula.\n`P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)` and `a3 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2`.\nSubstituting the second into the first:\n`P3 / P1 = [ (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2 ]^(3/2) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\nFirst, find `T_eq1 / T_eq3`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\nNow, cube this value:\n`P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3 ≈ 33.386...`\nThe result is consistent.\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
