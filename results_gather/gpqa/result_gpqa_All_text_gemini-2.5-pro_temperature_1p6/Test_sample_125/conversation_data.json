    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry of Reactants:** Identify if the starting materials are chiral or achiral, and if chiral, whether they are a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture.\n2.  **Nature of the Reaction:** Understand how the reagents (LAH, NaBH4) affect the functional groups (ketones) and whether they create new stereocenters.\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Products:** Determine all the stereoisomers formed in each reaction. Consider their relationships (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds).\n4.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** Separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers (which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** Uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone.\n    *   It possesses one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and it is the pure (S) enantiomer.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 stereocenter.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because the configuration at C5 is the same in both). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone.\n    *   The molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product, pentane-2,4-diol, has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products formed must be in a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n    *   Let's consider the possible stereoisomers:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an **enantiomeric pair**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n        2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). Therefore, it is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   In total, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates molecules based on polarity. Enantiomers have identical polarities and will co-elute (appear as a single peak). Diastereomers have different polarities and will separate.\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has a different polarity and will elute as a separate, **1 peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC** = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers. It also separates diastereomers. Essentially, it can distinguish between all five unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   **Product 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n*   **Product 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak** (separate from its diastereomer)\n*   **Product 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   **Product 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separate from its enantiomer)\n*   **Product 5:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separate from its diastereomers)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC** = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC: **4**\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC: **5**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
