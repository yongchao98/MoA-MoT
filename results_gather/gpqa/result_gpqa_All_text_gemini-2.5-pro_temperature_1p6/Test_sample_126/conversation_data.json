    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n**Step 1: Draw the structure of the starting material.**\nThe name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n*   **\"nona\"**: This indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n*   **\"2,6-diene\"**: This indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n*   **\"5-butyl\"**: This indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's draw the carbon skeleton and number it:\n¹CH₃–²CH=³CH–⁴CH₂–⁵CH–⁶CH=⁷CH–⁸CH₂–⁹CH₃\nNow, we add the butyl group at position 5:\n      CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃\n      |\n¹CH₃–²CH=³CH–⁴CH₂–⁵CH–⁶CH=⁷CH–⁸CH₂–⁹CH₃\n\nThis is the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. It contains a total of 9 + 4 = 13 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the type of reaction.**\nThe starting material is a 1,5-diene (the double bonds at C2 and C6 are separated by three single bonds: C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6). When 1,5-dienes are heated, they typically undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This is a pericyclic reaction where the molecule rearranges its bonds in a concerted cyclic transition state.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Cope rearrangement mechanism.**\nThe Cope rearrangement involves the six atoms of the 1,5-diene system: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7.\nLet's number this system for the rearrangement:\n      [3]  [2]  [1]\n      C4 – C3 = C2\n      |\n      C5 – C6 = C7\n      [3'] [2'] [1']\n\nThe reaction involves:\n1.  **Breaking** the sigma bond between the two allylic fragments, which is the C4–C5 bond (the [3]–[3'] bond).\n2.  **Forming** a new sigma bond between the ends of the two fragments, which is the C2–C7 bond (the [1]–[1'] bond).\n3.  **Shifting** the two pi bonds. The double bond between C2=C3 moves to C3=C4, and the double bond between C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the product.**\nLet's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product:\n*   The C4-C5 bond is broken.\n*   A new C2-C7 bond is formed.\n*   New double bonds are formed: C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n*   The substituents remain on their original carbon atoms:\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃) is on C2 (originally C1 attached to C2).\n    *   An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is on C7 (originally C8-C9 attached to C7).\n    *   A butyl group (-C₄H₉) is on C5.\n\nLet's sketch the product's structure based on this new connectivity:\n      CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n       |       |\nCH₂=CH–CH–––––CH–CH=CH–CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n  ^C4  ^C3  ^C2      ^C7  ^C6  ^C5  <--- Butyl Group --->\n\n**Step 5: Name the product using IUPAC rules.**\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the double bonds).** The chain must contain the carbons C3, C4, C5, C6. The path containing these atoms is ...C4=C3-C2-C7-C6=C5... To find the longest continuous chain, we must extend from the ends (C4 and C5).\n    *   The chain extends from C5 into the butyl group.\n    *   The C4 end is a terminal CH₂ group.\n    The longest chain is therefore:\n    H₂C=CH-CH-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n    ^C4^C3 ^C2 ^C7 ^C6 ^C5 ^Bu1 ^Bu2 ^Bu3 ^Bu4\n    The total length of this chain is 10 carbons, so the parent alkane is \"decane\". Since it has two double bonds, it's a \"decadiene\".\n\n2.  **Number the main chain** to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   **Numbering from the left (C4 end):**\n        ¹C=²C–³C–⁴C–⁵C=⁶C–⁷C–⁸C–⁹C–¹⁰C\n        The double bonds start at positions 1 and 5. This gives the name **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   **Numbering from the right (butyl end):**\n        ¹⁰C=⁹C–⁸C–⁷C–⁶C=⁵C–⁴C–³C–²C–¹C\n        The double bonds start at positions 5 and 9. This gives the name **deca-5,9-diene**.\n    Comparing the locant sets (1,5) and (5,9), the set (1,5) is lower. So, we number from the left.\n\n3.  **Identify and name the substituents.**\n    *   On carbon 3 of the new chain (which is the original C2), there is a methyl group (-CH₃). So, we have a **3-methyl** substituent.\n    *   On carbon 4 of the new chain (which is the original C7), there is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). So, we have a **4-ethyl** substituent.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final name.**\n    The substituents are listed in alphabetical order (ethyl before methyl).\n    The full IUPAC name is: **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\nA) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nB) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (same as A)\nD) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n\nOur derived name, 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
