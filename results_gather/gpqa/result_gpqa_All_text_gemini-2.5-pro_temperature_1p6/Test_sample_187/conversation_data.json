    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Crystal System:** The crystal is rhombohedral. This is a system where the primitive unit cell is a rhombohedron.\n2.  **Lattice Parameters:**\n    *   The primitive lattice vectors have equal length, `a = b = c`. The problem states an \"interatomic distance\" of 10 Angstrom. In the context of a simple lattice, this is interpreted as the length of the primitive lattice vector, so `a = 10 Å`.\n    *   The interaxial angles are equal but not 90 degrees: `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n3.  **Target:** We need to find the interplanar distance `d_hkl` for the `(hkl) = (111)` plane.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Formula Choice:** The formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is quite complex. A common and often simpler method is to convert the rhombohedral system to its equivalent hexagonal representation.\n2.  **Coordinate Transformation:** When converting from a rhombohedral to a hexagonal setting, both the lattice parameters and the Miller indices of the plane must be transformed.\n3.  **Interpretation of \"Interatomic Distance\":** We assume this refers to the lattice parameter `a` of the primitive rhombohedral cell. This is a standard convention in such problems unless a specific crystal structure (like one with a basis) is mentioned.\n4.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The calculation involves square roots and trigonometric functions, so care must be taken with numerical precision. Using exact values (`√3`, etc.) as long as possible is good practice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\nWe will use the hexagonal setting method as it is more straightforward for this specific plane.\n\n**Step 1: Convert Miller Indices from Rhombohedral to Hexagonal**\n\nThe transformation for Miller indices `(hkl)_R` in the rhombohedral system to `(HKL)_H` in the hexagonal system is given by:\n*   `H = h - k`\n*   `K = k - l`\n*   `L = h + k + l`\n\nFor the given plane `(111)_R`:\n*   `H = 1 - 1 = 0`\n*   `K = 1 - 1 = 0`\n*   `L = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`\nSo, the plane `(111)_R` is equivalent to the plane `(003)_H` in the hexagonal setting.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Interplanar Spacing Formula for a Hexagonal System**\n\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing `d` in a hexagonal crystal system is:\n`1/d² = (4/3) * (H² + K² + HK) / a_H² + L² / c_H²`\nwhere `a_H` and `c_H` are the lattice parameters of the hexagonal unit cell.\n\nFor the plane `(003)_H`:\n*   `H = 0`, `K = 0`, `L = 3`\n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n`1/d² = (4/3) * (0² + 0² + 0*0) / a_H² + 3² / c_H²`\n`1/d² = 0 + 9 / c_H²`\n`d² = c_H² / 9`\n`d = c_H / 3`\nThis shows that the interplanar distance for the `(111)_R` plane depends only on the `c_H` parameter of the equivalent hexagonal cell.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Hexagonal Lattice Parameter `c_H`**\n\nThe hexagonal lattice parameters (`a_H`, `c_H`) can be calculated from the rhombohedral parameters (`a_R`, `α`). We only need `c_H`:\n`c_H = a_R * sqrt(3 * (1 + 2cosα))`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `a_R = 10 Å`\n*   `α = 30°`\nThe cosine of 30° is `cos(30°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866`.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula for `c_H`:\n`c_H = 10 * sqrt(3 * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2)))`\n`c_H = 10 * sqrt(3 * (1 + √3))`\n`c_H = 10 * sqrt(3 + 3√3)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Interplanar Distance `d`**\n\nNow we use the relationship from Step 2, `d = c_H / 3`, and the value of `c_H` from Step 3.\n`d = (10 * sqrt(3 + 3√3)) / 3`\n\nLet's compute the numerical value:\n*   `√3 ≈ 1.73205`\n*   `3√3 ≈ 5.19615`\n*   `3 + 3√3 ≈ 8.19615`\n*   `sqrt(8.19615) ≈ 2.8629`\n\n`d ≈ (10 * 2.8629) / 3`\n`d ≈ 28.629 / 3`\n`d ≈ 9.543` Angstrom\n\nThis value is very close to 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated interplanar distance for the (111) plane is approximately 9.54 Angstrom. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
