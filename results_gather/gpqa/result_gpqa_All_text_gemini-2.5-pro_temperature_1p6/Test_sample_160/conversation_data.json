    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions of λ1 and λ2\n\n*   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules inside the vacuum chamber. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n*   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the electron beam. It describes the average distance an electron travels before being scattered by a residual gas molecule.\n\nThe physical conditions (temperature and pressure, and thus the number density of gas molecules) are the same for both scenarios.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the formula for Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle is:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)\n\nFor a gas where all particles are identical and in thermal motion (like the residual gas molecules), the formula is slightly modified to account for the movement of the target particles as well. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2.\n\n*   **Formula for λ1**: λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n*   **n_gas**: The number density of the gas molecules.\n*   **σ_gas-gas**: The collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is determined by the physical size (e.g., the van der Waals radius) of the molecules. A collision occurs when the centers of two molecules come within a distance equal to their diameter.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)\n\nFor the electron beam, the electrons are the projectiles and the gas molecules are the targets. A critical point is the relative speed. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning their speed is very close to the speed of light. The gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds (hundreds of meters per second). Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective. When targets are stationary, the √2 factor is not used.\n\n*   **Formula for λ2**: λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)\n*   **n_gas**: The same number density of gas molecules as before.\n*   **σ_e-gas**: The scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis.\n*   **σ_gas-gas**: This cross-section is relatively large because it's based on the physical size of the entire gas molecule. One molecule cannot pass through another.\n*   **σ_e-gas**: An electron is a fundamental particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. The \"collision\" is an electromagnetic scattering event, caused by the electron's interaction with the Coulomb field of the molecule's nucleus and its electron cloud. A high-energy electron can pass straight through the diffuse electron cloud of a molecule without significant deflection. For a scattering event to be significant enough to be considered a \"collision\" (i.e., removing the electron from the high-resolution beam), the electron must pass very close to the nucleus. Therefore, the effective target area an electron \"sees\" is much smaller than the physical area presented by one gas molecule to another.\n\nFrom this physical reasoning, we can confidently conclude:\n**σ_e-gas < σ_gas-gas**\n\n### Step 6: Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nNow let's compare the two expressions:\n*   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n*   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)\n\nWe have two factors that make the denominator of λ1 larger than the denominator of λ2:\n1.  **The √2 factor**: The denominator of λ1 has a √2 (≈ 1.414) factor that is absent in the denominator of λ2.\n2.  **The Cross-Section**: The cross-section σ_gas-gas is larger than σ_e-gas.\n\nSince both of these factors make the denominator of λ1 larger than the denominator of λ2, the resulting value of λ1 must be smaller than λ2.\n\nLet's form a ratio to be more quantitative:\n(λ2 / λ1) = [1 / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas)]\n(λ2 / λ1) = (√2 * n_gas * σ_gas-gas) / (n_gas * σ_e-gas)\n(λ2 / λ1) = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)\n\nSince we established that σ_gas-gas > σ_e-gas, the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas) is greater than 1.\nTherefore:\n(λ2 / λ1) > √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nThis means that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Specifically, λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.\n\n### Step 7: Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's check our result against the given options:\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. Our analysis shows λ2 > 1.414*λ1.\n*   B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect. There is a clear physical reason for them to be different.\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is consistent with our result. If λ2 is greater than 1.414*λ1, it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: This is incorrect.\n\nThe only plausible option is C.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Distinguish between the two types of collisions: gas-gas vs. electron-gas.\n*   Recognize that the number density `n` of the target gas molecules is constant.\n*   Apply the correct MFP formula for each case, noting the presence of the √2 factor for gas-gas collisions and its absence for high-speed electrons hitting stationary targets.\n*   Correctly reason that the electron-gas scattering cross-section (σ_e-gas) is smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gas-gas).\n*   Combine these points to conclude that λ2 must be significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
