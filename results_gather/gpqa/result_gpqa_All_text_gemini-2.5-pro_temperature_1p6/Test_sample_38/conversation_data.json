    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the numerical value of “a”.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principle\nThe fundamental principle of quantum mechanics used here is the **normalization of the wave function**. The wave function, Ψ(x), contains all the information about a particle. The square of its magnitude, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a position x. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integration is performed over the entire region where the particle can be found.\n\n### Step 2: Define the wave function and its complex conjugate\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe complex conjugate, Ψ*(x), is found by replacing 'i' with '-i':\nΨ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability density |Ψ(x)|²\nThe probability density is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ(x) * Ψ*(x)\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ]\n\nThis is in the form (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B², where A = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) and B = 0.5i.\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\nSince i² = -1:\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n### Step 4: Set up the normalization integral\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, these are the limits of our integration for the normalization condition.\n∫ (from 1 to 3) [ a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\n### Step 5: Solve the integral\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx + ∫ (from 1 to 3) [ 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\n**Part 1:** ∫ (from 1 to 3) [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx\nSince 'a²' is a constant, we take it out of the integral:\n= a² * ∫ (from 1 to 3) [ 1 / (1 + x) ] dx\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n= a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] (from 1 to 3)\n= a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n= a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2)\n= a² * ln(2)\n\n**Part 2:** ∫ (from 1 to 3) [ 0.25 ] dx\n= [ 0.25x ] (from 1 to 3)\n= (0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1)\n= 0.75 - 0.25\n= 0.5\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \"a\"\nNow, substitute the results of the integrals back into the normalization equation:\n[ a² * ln(2) ] + 0.5 = 1\n\nSubtract 0.5 from both sides:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nIsolate a²:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nTake the square root to find 'a':\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\n### Step 7: Compare with the options\nThe calculated value a ≈ 0.8494 is closest to the option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Complex Conjugate:** The calculation relies on correctly finding Ψ*(x) and then multiplying it by Ψ(x). A simple mistake here will lead to the wrong probability density.\n2.  **Integration Limits:** It is crucial to use the correct limits of integration [1, 3] as specified in the problem statement.\n3.  **The Ensemble Size:** The information about 10,000 systems confirms that we are dealing with a well-behaved quantum system where the theoretical probability distribution is experimentally verifiable. However, the number 10,000 is not used in the calculation for the normalization constant 'a', which is a property of the wave function for a single system.\n4.  **Logarithm Rules:** Correctly applying logarithm rules (e.g., ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)) simplifies the calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
