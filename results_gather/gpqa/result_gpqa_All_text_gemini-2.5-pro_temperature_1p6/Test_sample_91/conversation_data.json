    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and structure.**\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds correctly.\n      CH3                    CH3                    CH3\n       |                      |                      |\n       C = CH --- CH2 --- CH --- CH2 --- CH = C\n      /                                            |\n    CH3                                           CH3\n\nNow, let's count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to find the molecular formula (CxHy).\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   (CH3)2C-: 2 in methyl groups + 1 in the chain = 3\n    *   =CH-: 1\n    *   -CH2-: 1\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 in the chain + 1 in the methyl group = 2\n    *   -CH2-: 1\n    *   -CH=: 1\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 1 in the chain + 2 in the methyl groups = 3\n    *   Total Carbon atoms (x) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   (CH3)2C-: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   =CH-: 1\n    *   -CH2-: 2\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 on the chain + 3 in the methyl group = 4\n    *   -CH2-: 2\n    *   -CH=: 1\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms (y) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\nWe can count the bonds from the structure or use a formula for acyclic molecules (Total bonds = Total atoms - 1).\nTotal atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\nTotal bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The remaining bonds are C-C single bonds.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C-H bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds)\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule (ΔHat, molecule).**\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\nΔHat(C12H22) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n*   Given Bond Energies:\n    *   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔHat(C12H22) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔHat(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔHat(C12H22) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements in their standard states.**\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(solid) + 11 H2(gas) → C12H22(gas)\nWe need to find the energy required to turn the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   Given Enthalpies of Atomization:\n    *   ΔHat(Carbon) = 1000 kJ/mol (for C(s) → C(g))\n    *   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization for H2(g), i.e., H2(g) → 2H(g))\n\nTotal ΔHat(elements) = [12 × ΔHat(Carbon)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]\nTotal ΔHat(elements) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nTotal ΔHat(elements) = 12000 + 1100\nTotal ΔHat(elements) = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°).**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the molecule from its gaseous atoms (which is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule).\nΔHf° = Total ΔHat(elements) - ΔHat(molecule)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf° = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 6: Check the options and units.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nThe given options are:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the molecule's enthalpy of atomization)\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 1900 kJ/g (The value is correct, but the unit is wrong)\nD) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nOption B is in kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units.\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × Atomic mass of C) + (22 × Atomic mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   Now, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g.\n    *   ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\n    *   ΔHf° (kJ/g) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<B>>>"
