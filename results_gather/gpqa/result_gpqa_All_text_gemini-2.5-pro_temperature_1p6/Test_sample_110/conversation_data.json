    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one) is the Michael donor, and the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) is the Michael acceptor. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base used to form the enolate from the ketone.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate (Michael donor):**\n    *   The base t-BuOK needs to remove an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only deprotonate at C6. This leads to the formation of a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael addition step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   This 1,4-conjugate addition forms a new C-C bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After the addition, the resulting intermediate is protonated (usually during workup) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring has a new substituent at the C6 position. The new substituent is `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt`.\n    *   The final structure has the following features on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   An oxo group at C1.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C2.\n        *   A methyl group and a `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group at C6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   To name this complex structure, IUPAC nomenclature often treats the substituted ring as a substituent on the simpler ester chain.\n    *   The main chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   When the ring is named as a substituent, the point of attachment is C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the functional groups the lowest possible locants. The attachment point is C1. The oxo group (=O) is at C2. The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups is at C3. The original methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of this new numbering scheme.\n    *   Therefore, the name is: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options B and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. 1-nitropropane is the Michael donor, and (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor. KOH is the base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile (Michael donor):**\n    *   The nitro group (–NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic.\n    *   KOH, a strong base, removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH–NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Michael addition step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃–CH=CH–CN).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting carbanion is protonated by water to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The product molecule is formed by connecting the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)–` fragment to the `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n             NO₂\n             |\n        CH₃–CH₂–CH – CH(CH₃) – CH₂ – CN\n        ```\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so the carbon chain is named as a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `C(6)H₃–C(5)H₂–C(4)H(NO₂) –C(3)H(CH₃)–C(2)H₂–C(1)N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The name of the product is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options A and B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that option B correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
