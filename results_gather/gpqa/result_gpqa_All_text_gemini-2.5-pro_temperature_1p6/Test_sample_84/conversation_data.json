    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Identify the Key Physics Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium with its star's radiation.\n*   **Doppler Effect (Radial Velocity):** The change in the wavelength of light from a star due to its motion towards or away from us, caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\n**3. Write Down the Relevant Formulas**\n*   The formula for the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} (1 - A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the planet's orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n\n*   The formula relating the star's observed radial velocity ($v_{r,star}$) to the properties of the system is (for a circular orbit, assuming $M_{star} \\gg M_{planet}$):\n    $v_{r,star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where:\n    *   $M_{planet}$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   The Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_{r,star}$):\n    $v_{r,star} = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where c is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength.\n\n**4. Simplify the Problem by Finding the Ratio**\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** We want to find $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$. Let's write out the ratio using the equilibrium temperature formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_1)}}{T_{star} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_2)}}$\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). This allows us to cancel many terms:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    **Careful Point 1:** The final answer depends only on the ratio of the orbital radii. Much of the given information ($M_{star}$, $R_{star}$, $T_{star}$, planet radii, $\\lambda_0$) is not needed for the final calculation, as it cancels out.\n\n*   **Orbital Radius Ratio:** To find $\\sqrt{a_2/a_1}$, we first need to find the ratio $a_2/a_1$. Let's rearrange the radial velocity formula to solve for the orbital radius 'a':\n    $v_{r,star}^2 = (\\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}})^2 (\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}) = \\frac{G M_{planet}^2}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_{planet}^2}{M_{star} v_{r,star}^2}$\n    Now, let's form the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} v_{r,star,2}^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} v_{r,star,1}^2)}$\n    The constants G and $M_{star}$ cancel:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\times \\frac{v_{r,star,1}^2}{v_{r,star,2}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{v_{r,star,1}}{v_{r,star,2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Substitute Values and Calculate**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Velocity Ratio:** The star's velocity $v_{r,star}$ is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift $\\Delta \\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n    $\\frac{v_{r,star,1}}{v_{r,star,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n    **Careful Point 2:** We can use the Doppler shifts directly, avoiding the need to calculate the actual velocities in m/s.\n\n*   **Calculate the Orbital Radius Ratio ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n    **Careful Point 3:** Remember to take the square root. A common mistake is to stop at the orbital radius ratio.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    $15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
