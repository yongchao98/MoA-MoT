    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process and Conservation Laws:**\n    *   The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$). The decay reaction is:\n        $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n    *   Since the pion is stationary, this is a decay at rest.\n    *   The fundamental principles governing this decay are the **Conservation of Energy** and the **Conservation of Momentum**.\n\n2.  **Define Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A single stationary pion ($\\pi^+$).\n        *   Initial Total Energy ($E_i$): Since it's at rest, the total energy is its rest mass energy.\n          $E_i = m_{\\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n        *   Initial Total Momentum ($\\vec{p}_i$): Since it's at rest, the momentum is zero.\n          $\\vec{p}_i = 0$\n    *   **Final State:** A muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$).\n        *   Final Total Energy ($E_f$): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n          $E_f = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n        *   Final Total Momentum ($\\vec{p}_f$): The vector sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino.\n          $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay ($\\vec{p}_i = \\vec{p}_f$).\n        $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    *   This implies that the momentum of the muon is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the momentum of the neutrino.\n        $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    *   Let $p$ be the magnitude of the momentum for both particles:\n        $p = |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}|$\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay ($E_i = E_f$).\n        $m_{\\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is given by:\n        $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n        $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu$): Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context. We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$).\n        $E_{\\nu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Energies and Momenta:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        1.  $m_{\\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n        2.  $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n        3.  $E_{\\nu} = pc$\n    *   Substitute equation (3) into equation (1):\n        $m_{\\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + pc$\n    *   Rearrange this to solve for $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n        $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+} c^2 - pc$\n    *   Substitute this expression for $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $pc = E_\\nu$ into equation (2):\n        $(m_{\\pi^+} c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        $(m_{\\pi^+} c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+} c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n    *   The $(pc)^2$ term cancels on both sides:\n        $(m_{\\pi^+} c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+} c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n    *   Now, we solve for $pc$, which is the energy of the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$):\n        $2(m_{\\pi^+} c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+} c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2$\n        $pc = E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+} c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+} c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi^+} c^2}$\n\n### Final Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy of the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   Given: $m_{\\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6$ MeV and $m_{\\mu^+} c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n    *   $E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n    *   $E_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n    *   $E_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    *   For a massless particle, the total energy is all kinetic energy.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    *   Using the conservation of energy equation:\n    *   $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+} c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\n    *   $E_{\\mu^+} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 109.82$ MeV\n\n4.  **Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    *   The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.\n    *   $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+} c^2$\n    *   $KE_{\\mu^+} = 109.82 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12$ MeV\n\n### Conclusion\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($\\mu^+$): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($\\nu$): **29.8 MeV**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic formulas are essential.** Classical mechanics would give incorrect results.\n*   The initial state being **at rest** greatly simplifies the momentum conservation equation.\n*   The assumption of a **massless neutrino** is a standard and valid approximation for this problem. It simplifies the energy-momentum relation for the neutrino to $E=pc$.\n*   The **Q-value** of the reaction (energy released) is the initial rest mass minus the final rest masses ($139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV). This energy is entirely converted into the kinetic energy of the products. A quick check shows $KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu} = 4.12 + 29.8 = 33.92$ MeV, confirming our result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
