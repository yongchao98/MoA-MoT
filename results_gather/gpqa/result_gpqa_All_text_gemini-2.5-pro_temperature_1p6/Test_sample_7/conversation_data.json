  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to determine the functional relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in disease resistance, based on the phenotypes of their single and double knockout mutants.\n\n2.  **List and Define Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Knock-out mutant:** A version of the plant where a specific gene is made non-functional.\n    *   **Wild-type (WT):** The normal, non-mutant plant, used as a control (100% resistance).\n    *   **Transcription Factor (TF):** A gene product that regulates the expression of other genes. If a TF is \"upstream,\" it controls genes \"downstream\" in a pathway.\n    *   **Epistasis:** An interaction where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene. If the phenotype of a double mutant (e.g., `g1g2`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (e.g., `g2`), then the second gene (G2) is said to be epistatic to the first gene (G1). This often implies the epistatic gene acts downstream in a linear pathway or is part of an essential parallel pathway.\n    *   **Gene Redundancy:** A situation where two or more genes perform similar functions. Knocking out one may have a small effect, but knocking out both has a much more severe effect because the compensatory mechanism is lost.\n    *   **Pleiotropy:** A single gene influencing multiple unrelated traits. The experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot draw any conclusions about pleiotropy from the given data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Data:**\n    *   **Control (WT):** 100% resistance\n    *   **g1 (G1 knocked out):** 75% resistance. G1 has a minor role in resistance.\n    *   **g2 (G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. G2 is absolutely essential for resistance. This is the most severe phenotype.\n    *   **g3 (G3 knocked out):** 50% resistance. G3 has a significant role in resistance, more than G1.\n    *   **g1g2 (G1 and G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n    *   **g2g3 (G2 and G3 knocked out):** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n    *   **g1g3 (G1 and G3 knocked out):** 10% resistance. This phenotype is more severe than either the `g1` or `g3` single mutants, indicating their effects are at least partially additive or synergistic.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Gene Interactions:**\n\n    *   **Epistasis involving G2:**\n        *   The phenotype of `g1g2` (0%) is the same as the phenotype of `g2` (0%). This means the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation. **Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1.**\n        *   The phenotype of `g2g3` (0%) is the same as the phenotype of `g2` (0%). This means the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g3` mutation. **Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G3.**\n\n    *   **Epistasis between G1 and G3:**\n        *   The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10% resistance.\n        *   This is different from the `g1` phenotype (75%) and the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n        *   **Therefore, G1 is NOT epistatic to G3, and G3 is NOT epistatic to G1.** Their effects are synergistic.\n\n    *   **Identifying the Transcription Factor:**\n        *   The question states that at least one gene is a TF acting upstream.\n        *   Gene G2 has the most severe phenotype when knocked out (0% resistance), and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This makes it the most likely candidate for a master regulator or an absolutely essential component in the primary resistance pathway. It is the strongest candidate for the transcription factor mentioned. However, we cannot rule out G1 or G3 being a TF based solely on this data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Possible, not contradicted by data.\n        *   \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Cannot be determined from the data.\n        *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": **This is TRUE**, as shown by the `g1g2` mutant phenotype.\n        *   Overall: This option contains one demonstrably true statement and two statements that are not contradicted by the data.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **This is FALSE.** The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). This makes the entire option incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **This is FALSE.** As explained for option B, this statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": **This is FALSE.** The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). This makes the entire option incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Options B, C, and D all contain a statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 that is directly contradicted by the experimental data. Therefore, they must be incorrect. Option A contains a statement (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\") that is clearly supported by the data. While the other two claims in option A cannot be fully proven with the given information, they are not contradicted by it either. Since options B, C, and D are provably false, option A is the only viable conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>"
