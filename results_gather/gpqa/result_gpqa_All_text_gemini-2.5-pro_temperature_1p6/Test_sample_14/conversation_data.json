    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best observing target.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 ($P_{tr1}$) with that of Planet_2 ($P_{tr2}$). The planet with the higher probability is the preferred target for observation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physics and Formula**\nThe geometric probability ($P_{tr}$) that a planet will transit its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$). This formula is valid for planets in circular orbits with random orbital inclinations.\n*   **Formula:** $P_{tr} = R_s / a$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities**\nThe problem does not provide the semi-major axis ($a$) directly. However, it provides the orbital period ($T$) and information about the host star's mass ($M_s$). We can connect these using Kepler's Third Law.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** $T^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$\n*   We can rearrange this to solve for $a$: $a^3 \\propto M_s T^2$, which means $a \\propto (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine Formulas to Express Transit Probability**\nNow, substitute the relationship for $a$ from Step 3 into the transit probability formula from Step 2.\n*   $P_{tr} \\propto R_s / (M_s T^2)^{1/3}$\nThis can be written as:\n*   $P_{tr} \\propto R_s \\cdot M_s^{-1/3} \\cdot T^{-2/3}$\n\n**Step 5: Define the Parameters for Each System**\nLet's denote the properties of the Planet_1 system with a subscript \"1\" and the Planet_2 system with a subscript \"2\".\n\n*   **Stellar Radii:** The host stars have the same radii.\n    *   $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$\n*   **Stellar Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star hosting Planet_2.\n    *   $M_{s1} = 2 \\cdot M_{s2}$\n*   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's.\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot T_2$\n\n**Careful Point:** Information like the planets having the same mass or being detected by the RV method is important for context but does not directly enter into this specific geometric probability calculation.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Ratio of the Two Probabilities**\nTo find out which planet has a higher probability and by how much, we calculate the ratio $P_{tr1} / P_{tr2}$.\n*   $\\frac{P_{tr1}}{P_{tr2}} = \\frac{R_{s1} \\cdot M_{s1}^{-1/3} \\cdot T_1^{-2/3}}{R_{s2} \\cdot M_{s2}^{-1/3} \\cdot T_2^{-2/3}}$\n\nWe can group the terms into ratios:\n*   $\\frac{P_{tr1}}{P_{tr2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{M_{s1}}{M_{s2}}\\right)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{-2/3}$\n\n**Step 7: Substitute the Known Relationships**\nNow, we plug in the values from Step 5.\n*   $\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}} = 1$\n*   $\\frac{M_{s1}}{M_{s2}} = 2$\n*   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio equation:\n*   $\\frac{P_{tr1}}{P_{tr2}} = (1) \\cdot (2)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{-2/3}$\n\n**Step 8: Simplify the Mathematical Expression**\nLet's carefully evaluate the terms with exponents.\n*   $(2)^{-1/3} = \\frac{1}{2^{1/3}}$\n*   $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{-2/3} = (3^{-1})^{-2/3} = 3^{(-1) \\times (-2/3)} = 3^{2/3}$\n\nNow, combine these results:\n*   $\\frac{P_{tr1}}{P_{tr2}} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{1/3}} \\cdot 3^{2/3} = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{2^{1/3}}$\n\nTo simplify further, we can put both terms under the same cube root:\n*   $\\frac{P_{tr1}}{P_{tr2}} = \\frac{(3^2)^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}} = \\frac{9^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\n**Step 9: Calculate the Final Numerical Value and Conclude**\nWe need to find the cube root of 4.5.\n*   $1^3 = 1$\n*   $2^3 = 8$\nThe answer must be between 1 and 2. A quick calculation shows:\n*   $1.65 \\times 1.65 \\times 1.65 \\approx 4.49$\n\nSo, $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65$.\n\nThis means $\\frac{P_{tr1}}{P_{tr2}} \\approx 1.65$. Since the ratio is greater than 1, Planet_1 has the higher transit probability. Specifically, its probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis conclusion matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
