    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics of the Problem\nThe problem describes the radioactive decay of a single atom. This process is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and probability. The key characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval depends only on the length of that interval, not on how long the atom has already existed without decaying.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. We can therefore rephrase the question as: \"What is the probability that a newly created atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\".\n\n### Step 2: Define the Mathematical Model\nRadioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The probability that an atom will survive for a time `t`, denoted as P_survive(t), is given by:\n`P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\nThe probability that an atom will decay within a time `t`, denoted as P_decay(t), is therefore:\n`P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n### Step 3: Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n\nThis allows us to determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n`P_survive(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nUsing our formula for survival:\n`P_survive(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We don't need to calculate the decay constant `λ` explicitly. We can use the expression `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68` as a stepping stone for our next calculation. This avoids rounding errors and simplifies the math.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established in Step 1, this is equivalent to finding `P_decay(150)`.\n\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150)`\n\nFirst, let's find the survival probability for 150 minutes, `P_survive(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate this to the value we found in Step 3 by using the properties of exponents:\n`e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(150/100) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n`P_survive(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n`P_survive(150) = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.55995...`\nWe can round this to `0.56`.\n\nSo, the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes is approximately 56%.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes:\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56 = 0.44`\n\nThis corresponds to a probability of 44%.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Avoid making a linear assumption. One might mistakenly think that if the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, the rate is 0.32%/minute. This would lead to a wrong answer of `150 * 0.32% = 48%`. The probability of decay is not linear with time; it follows an exponential curve.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
