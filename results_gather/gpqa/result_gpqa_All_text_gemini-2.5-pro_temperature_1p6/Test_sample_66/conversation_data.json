    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the initial and final states\nThe system consists of two electrons in p-orbitals. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$.\n*   **Particle 1:** $l_1 = 1$. The possible values for its magnetic quantum number $m_{l1}$ are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Particle 2:** $l_2 = 1$. The possible values for its magnetic quantum number $m_{l2}$ are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe system is given in a specific **coupled state** $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$, which is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   $l_1=1$ is the orbital angular momentum of electron 1.\n*   $l_2=1$ is the orbital angular momentum of electron 2.\n*   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum. This corresponds to the eigenvalue of the total Z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, which is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\nA measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome.\n*   **Desired outcome for $L_{1z}$:** eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the state where $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   **Desired outcome for $L_{2z}$:** eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the state where $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the **uncoupled state** $|l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1, 1, -1>$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the coupled and uncoupled bases\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding the system in the state $|1, -1, 1, -1>$ given that it is initially in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\nIn quantum mechanics, this probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the final state onto the initial state:\n$P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2$\n$P = |<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\nThe term $<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a **Clebsch-Gordan coefficient**. It represents the amplitude for the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ to be composed of the uncoupled state $|1, -1, 1, -1>$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the rules of angular momentum addition\nA fundamental rule in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\n$L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\nThis translates to a relationship between their respective quantum numbers:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is non-zero only if this condition, $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$, is satisfied. This is a crucial selection rule.\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific case:\n*   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have $m = -1$.\n*   From the final uncoupled state $|1, -1, 1, -1>$, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n*   Let's calculate the sum for the final state: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nNow we compare the total $m$ value from the initial state with the sum of the individual $m_l$ values from the final state:\nIs $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$?\nIs $-1 = -2$? No, this is false.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Since the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero.\n$<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final probability\nThe probability is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n$P = |<1, -1, 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means that it is impossible to find the system with individual z-components of angular momentum corresponding to $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ if it is in the total angular momentum state with $m=-1$. The component $|1, -1, 1, -1>$ simply does not exist in the expansion of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\n(For completeness, the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a superposition of states where $m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-1$. These are the states $|1, 0, 1, -1>$ and $|1, -1, 1, 0>$. Specifically, $|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0, 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1, 1, 0>$. The state we are looking for, $|1, -1, 1, -1>$, is orthogonal to both of these components.)\n\nThe joint probability of getting eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
