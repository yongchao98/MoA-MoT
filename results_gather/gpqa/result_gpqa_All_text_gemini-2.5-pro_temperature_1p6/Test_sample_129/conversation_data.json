    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The goal is to find the minimum redshift (`z`) at which a specific spectral feature, the Lyman-alpha absorption line, can be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Spectral Line:** Lyman-alpha (Lyman-α) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **Rest-frame Wavelength ($\\lambda_0$):** The problem states this is ~1216 Angstroms (Å). This is the wavelength at which the absorption happens in the reference frame of the hydrogen cloud. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Observing Instrument:** A ground-based optical telescope. This is the crucial constraint.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Constraint (Ground-based Optical Telescope):**\n    *   The Earth's atmosphere is not transparent to all wavelengths of light. It absorbs most radiation at certain wavelengths.\n    *   Specifically, the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere absorbs almost all UV light with wavelengths shorter than about 3000 Å (or 300 nanometers).\n    *   For practical astronomical observations from the ground, even from high-altitude observatories, the useful limit is typically around 3200 Å to 3500 Å. Below this, atmospheric absorption becomes too severe.\n    *   Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected from the ground, its observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) must be greater than this atmospheric cutoff. We need $\\lambda_{obs} > \\lambda_{cutoff}$.\n\n4.  **Relate Redshift, Rest Wavelength, and Observed Wavelength:**\n    *   The cosmological redshift (`z`) stretches the wavelength of light from distant objects. The relationship is given by the formula:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 \\times (1 + z)$\n    *   Where:\n        *   $\\lambda_{obs}$ is the wavelength we observe on Earth.\n        *   $\\lambda_0$ is the rest-frame wavelength (1216 Å).\n        *   `z` is the redshift.\n\n5.  **Set up the Calculation for the Lower Limit:**\n    *   We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift. This means we want to find the smallest `z` for which the Lyman-alpha line is *just barely* observable.\n    *   This occurs when the redshift is just enough to shift the Lyman-alpha line from its UV rest-frame wavelength (1216 Å) to the minimum wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere ($\\lambda_{cutoff}$).\n    *   So, we set $\\lambda_{obs}$ to be equal to this minimum observable wavelength, $\\lambda_{obs, min}$.\n    *   The formula becomes:\n        $z_{min} = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs, min}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n\n6.  **Estimate the Atmospheric Cutoff and Calculate `z`:**\n    *   The precise value of the atmospheric cutoff is not given, so we must use a reasonable estimate. A common practical limit for efficient ground-based spectroscopy is around **3500 Å**. Let's use this value.\n    *   Plug the values into the formula:\n        *   $\\lambda_{obs, min} \\approx 3500$ Å\n        *   $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n    *   Calculate `z`:\n        $z_{min} = \\frac{3500}{1216} - 1$\n        $z_{min} \\approx 2.878 - 1$\n        $z_{min} \\approx 1.878$\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88.\n    *   The given options are: A) 3, B) 2.4, C) 1.2, D) 1.9.\n    *   Our calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to option D) 1.9.\n\n8.  **Final Check by Analyzing the Options:**\n    *   **If z = 1.2 (Option C):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 2675$ Å. This is deep in the UV and is completely blocked by the atmosphere. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   **If z = 1.9 (Option D):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526$ Å. This is in the near-UV range, which is observable from good ground-based sites. This is a plausible lower limit.\n    *   **If z = 2.4 (Option B):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 4134$ Å. This is in the visible violet range and is easily observable. While it's an observable redshift, it's not the *lowest possible* redshift.\n    *   **If z = 3 (Option A):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 3) = 4864$ Å. This is in the blue-green visible range and is easily observable, but it's not the lower limit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe lower limit is determined by the point where the redshift is just large enough to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the atmospheric optical window. Based on a practical atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Å, the minimum redshift is calculated to be ~1.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
