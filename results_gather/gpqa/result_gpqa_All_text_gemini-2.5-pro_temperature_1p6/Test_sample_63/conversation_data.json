    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe problem describes the heating of a mixture of salts A and B, which decompose completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g.\n    *   This means the mass of H₂O produced is 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is ~18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change.\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were produced during the decomposition. This is a crucial clue, suggesting the salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ is 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This suggests it's a very stable, non-reactive gas. Nitrogen (N₂) is the most likely candidate in the context of salt decomposition.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Assuming gas C is N₂, its mass is 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the results with the law of conservation of mass.**\nLet's check if the total mass of the gaseous products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n*   Total mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g), confirming that our analysis of the products (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.10 mol N₂) is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the identity of salts A and B.**\nThe decomposition produced H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Since they are salts, they should consist of a cation and an anion.\n*   The only common cation formed from these elements is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n*   The anions must be formed from Nitrogen and Oxygen, such as nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\nLet's propose that the salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Now, let's write their decomposition reactions and see if they match our product quantities.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures, it decomposes to produce oxygen. The balanced equation is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) + O₂(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is **equimolar**. Let `x` be the number of moles of salt A and `x` be the number of moles of salt B.\n\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂, we get: `x` mol N₂ and `2x` mol H₂O.\n*   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃, according to the stoichiometry (2 moles of salt produce...), we get: (`x`/2) mol O₂, `x` mol N₂, and `2x` mol H₂O.\n\nNow, let's set up a system of equations for the total moles of each product:\n*   Total Moles O₂ = `x`/2 = 0.025 mol\n*   Total Moles N₂ = (`x` from NH₄NO₂) + (`x` from NH₄NO₃) = `x` + `x` = 2`x`\n*   Total Moles H₂O = (`2x` from NH₄NO₂) + (`2x` from NH₄NO₃) = 2`x` + 2`x` = 4`x`\n\nLet's solve for `x` using the oxygen equation:\n*   `x`/2 = 0.025  =>  `x` = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's verify this `x` value with the other products:\n*   Expected moles of N₂ = 2`x` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. This matches the observed 0.10 mol.\n*   Expected moles of H₂O = 4`x` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This matches the observed 0.20 mol.\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = 8 atoms total.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = 9 atoms total.\n\n*   **Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
