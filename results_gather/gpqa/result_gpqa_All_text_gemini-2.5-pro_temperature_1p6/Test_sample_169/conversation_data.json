    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the expectation value of the spin component along the y-direction, denoted as `<S_y>`, for an electron in a given spin state.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Key Elements**\n*   **Spin State Vector (`|ψ⟩`)**: The electron's spin state is given by the vector `(3i, 4)`. In quantum mechanics, this is represented as a column vector, or \"ket\":\n    `|ψ⟩ = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`\n\n*   **Spin Operator (`S_y`)**: The spin operator for the y-direction is related to the Pauli spin matrix `σ_y` by the formula `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`. Given the matrix for `σ_y`, the operator is:\n    `S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}`\n\n*   **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by:\n    `<A> = \\frac{⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩}{⟨ψ|ψ⟩}`\n    where `⟨ψ|` is the \"bra\" vector, which is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector `|ψ⟩`.\n\n### **Step 3: List Careful Points**\n1.  **Normalization:** The given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized. The formula for the expectation value correctly accounts for this by dividing by `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`. We must calculate this normalization factor.\n2.  **Bra Vector Calculation:** To find `⟨ψ|`, we need to take the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. This involves two operations: transposing the column vector into a row vector and taking the complex conjugate of each element. Remember that the complex conjugate of `i` is `-i`.\n3.  **Operator:** We must use the spin operator `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, not just the Pauli matrix `σ_y`. Don't forget the `ħ/2` factor.\n4.  **Matrix Multiplication:** The order of multiplication is crucial: `⟨ψ|` multiplied by the result of `S_y|ψ⟩`.\n\n### **Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**1. Find the bra vector `⟨ψ|`**\n*   The ket vector is `|ψ⟩ = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`.\n*   First, transpose it to get `(3i, 4)`.\n*   Next, take the complex conjugate of each element: the conjugate of `3i` is `-3i`, and the conjugate of `4` (a real number) is `4`.\n*   So, the bra vector is `⟨ψ| = (-3i, 4)`.\n\n**2. Calculate the normalization factor `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**\n*   This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i, 4) \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n*   `= -9(i^2) + 16`\n*   Since `i^2 = -1`, we get: `= -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n\n**3. Calculate the term `S_y|ψ⟩`**\n*   Multiply the operator `S_y` by the ket vector `|ψ⟩`.\n*   `S_y|ψ⟩ = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}`\n\n**4. Calculate the numerator `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`**\n*   Multiply the bra vector `⟨ψ|` by the result from the previous step.\n*   `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (-3i, 4) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right]`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12i^2 - 12]`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-12 - 12]`\n*   `= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-24] = -12\\hbar`\n\n**5. Compute the final expectation value `<S_y>`**\n*   Now, divide the numerator by the normalization factor.\n*   `<S_y> = \\frac{⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩}{⟨ψ|ψ⟩} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}`\n*   The result is `-12\\hbar/25`.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\nComparing the result `-12\\hbar/25` with the given options:\nA) -12*hbar/25\nB) -25*hbar/2\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) 12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
