    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Setup and Definitions\n*   **Source:** A point charge `q`.\n*   **Source Trajectory:** The position of the charge at any time `t'` is given by the vector `\\vec{s}(t')`.\n*   **Observation Point:** The point in space where we want to find the potentials is `\\vec{r}`.\n*   **Observation Time:** The time at which we observe the potentials is `t`.\n*   **Retarded Time (`t_r`):** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. The potential at `(\\vec{r}, t)` is not determined by the charge's position at time `t`, but by its position at an earlier time, `t_r`, such that the time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}` is exactly `t - t_r`. This is called the retardation condition.\n*   **Retardation Condition:** `t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}`.\n*   **Vector `\\vec{d}`:** The problem defines `\\vec{d}` as the vector from the source at the retarded time `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}`.\n    *   `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`\n*   **Distance `d`:** The magnitude of `\\vec{d}` is `d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`.\n*   **Source Velocity `\\vec{v}`:** The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r` is `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}|_{t'=t_r}`.\n\nUsing these definitions, the retardation condition can be written as `c(t - t_r) = d`.\n\n### Step 2: Start with the General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\nThe general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` for a time-varying charge density `\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t')` and current density `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t')` are the retarded potentials:\n*   `V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} d^3r'`\n*   `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} d^3r'`\nwhere `t_r' = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|}{c}` is the retarded time for a source element at `\\vec{r'}`.\n\n### Step 3: Define Densities for a Moving Point Charge\nFor a single point charge `q` with trajectory `\\vec{s}(t')`, the charge and current densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n*   Charge density: `\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n*   Current density: `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))` where `\\vec{v}(t')` is the charge's velocity at time `t'`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Scalar Potential V\nSubstitute the charge density into the formula for `V`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} d^3r'`\n\nThis integral is tricky because the retarded time `t_r'` inside the delta function depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r'}`. A standard technique to evaluate this is to change the integration variable from `\\vec{r'}` to `t'`, which leads to a Jacobian factor. The result of this integration (a standard derivation in E&M textbooks) is the **Liénard-Weichert potential**.\n\nThe denominator requires careful evaluation. The effect of retardation combined with the motion of the source leads to a \"piling up\" or \"spreading out\" of the field information as it propagates. This is captured by a correction factor in the denominator. The denominator factor becomes `d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})`.\n\nThe result for the scalar potential is:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}`\n\nTo match the form given in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\nThis is the famous Liénard-Weichert scalar potential.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sign in the denominator is negative (`- \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}`). This is crucial. When the charge is moving toward the observer (`\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}` is negative), the denominator `dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}` increases, making the potential weaker. This seems counter-intuitive, but it relates to the way the \"field lines\" are perceived to be spread out in this case. Conversely, when moving away, the field lines are compressed, and the potential is stronger.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Vector Potential A\nThe process is identical for the vector potential `\\vec{A}`. We start with the general formula and substitute the current density for a point charge.\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_r') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} d^3r'`\n\nThe integration proceeds in the same way. The velocity `\\vec{v}` is evaluated at the retarded time `t_r` and is treated as a constant factor with respect to the spatial integration. The result is:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}}`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\n### Step 6: Compare the Derived Potentials with the Options\nLet's check the options provided:\n\n*   **A) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}`,  `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`:** Incorrect. This `V` is the static potential and doesn't account for retardation or motion. `\\vec{A}` is also incorrectly formed.\n*   **B) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`:** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is `+`, which contradicts the derivation. The constant `\\mu` should be `\\mu_o`.\n*   **C) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`:** Correct. Both expressions match our derived Liénard-Weichert potentials exactly.\n*   **D) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`:** Incorrect. `V` is the static potential, which is not correct for a moving charge. Although the relation `\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V` is actually true for the correct Liénard-Weichert potentials, the expressions given for `V` and `\\vec{A}` individually are wrong.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step derivation of the potentials for a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Weichert potentials, yields the expressions found in option C.\n\n`V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\nThese match option C precisely.\n\n<<<C>>>"
