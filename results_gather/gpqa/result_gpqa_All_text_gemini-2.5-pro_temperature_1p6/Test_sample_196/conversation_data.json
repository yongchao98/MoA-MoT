    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X) from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (`bs`) appearing this far downfield (highly deshielded) is the definitive signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear at 8.0 ppm, while the protons meta to the -COOH group are less deshielded and appear at 7.2 ppm.\n    *   **Structure so far:** We have a para-substituted benzoic acid moiety. The structure is `R-C₆H₄-COOH`, where `R` is the unknown alkyl group.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group (R) Signals:** Let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of `R`.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Fragment: `-CH₂-CH₃`.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). Fragment: `-CH(CH₃)-`.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our first fragment. It is adjacent to both the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and a methine group, causing complex splitting (a multiplet).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift (~2.9 ppm) indicates it's a benzylic proton (i.e., directly attached to the benzene ring). It is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the adjacent methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's piece these fragments together.\n        *   The benzylic CH (at 2.9 ppm) is attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   This CH is also attached to a CH₃ group (the doublet at 1.4 ppm).\n        *   This CH is also attached to a -CH₂-CH₃ group (the ethyl part, with the CH₂ at 1.7 ppm and the terminal CH₃ at 0.9 ppm).\n        *   The complete group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Final Structure of Compound X:** Putting everything together, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Chemical Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a variety of oxygen-containing functional groups, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane.\n*   **Transformation:** The key transformation in this reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The alkyl substituent (sec-butyl) and the aromatic ring are unreactive under these conditions.\n    *   `Ar-COOH` --(Red P, HI)--> `Ar-CH₃`\n\n**3. Prediction of the Final Product**\n\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n*   Therefore, the final product is a benzene ring substituted with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.\n*   The name of this compound is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Matching the Product with the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure and functional groups.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group. An isobutyl group is -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **IR/NMR Interpretation:** Correctly identifying the carboxylic acid and the para-substitution pattern is crucial. A mistake here leads to the wrong starting material.\n2.  **Alkyl Group Isomerism:** Differentiating between the signals for sec-butyl, isobutyl, and other butyl isomers based on splitting patterns and chemical shifts is a key skill tested here.\n3.  **Reagent Specificity:** Knowing the specific outcome of the reaction with Red P / HI is the most critical piece of chemical knowledge required. One must recall that it is a powerful reducing agent that takes a carboxylic acid all the way to a methyl group, unlike other common reducers like LiAlH₄ (which would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol).\n4.  **Nomenclature:** Correctly naming the final product is necessary to match it with the options.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
