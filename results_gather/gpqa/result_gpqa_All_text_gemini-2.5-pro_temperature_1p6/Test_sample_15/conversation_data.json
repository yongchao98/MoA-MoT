    "An optically active compound is a chiral molecule that is present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. We will analyze each compound for chirality and check if it is specified as a single stereoisomer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `ClCH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains a double bond. Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon with four different substituents). There are no such sp³ hybridized carbons. The sp² carbons of the double bond are also not stereocenters. The entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name itself, `(3aR,7aS,E)`, specifies a single, specific stereoisomer. The designations `R` and `S` are used for absolute configurations at chiral centers. The presence of these designations indicates that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of the enantiomers. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. The complex and asymmetric substitution pattern makes it extremely unlikely to be a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The molecule is structurally symmetric, as the two ends (`HOOC-CH(CH₃)-`) are identical. When a symmetric molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations (one `R` and one `S`), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making them achiral and thus optically inactive, despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive** (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It has two stereocenters with the same configuration (`R,R`). This isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are not superimposable. Therefore, the `(2R,3R)` isomer is a chiral molecule. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine C1. It is attached to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring path `-CH₂-C(H)=C(H)-` (path C1->C2->C3=C4), and 4) the ring path `-CH₂-CH₂-C(H)=` (path C1->C6->C5=C4). Since these two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The name `(R)-` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` most likely indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's consider the `cis`-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. If you visualize this molecule (e.g., in a chair conformation with all OH groups axial, or all equatorial), you will find it possesses a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, it has a threefold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σv) that each pass through a C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom. The presence of any plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral. This molecule is a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name breaks down as follows: The parent chain is `butanone` with the carbonyl at C1 (`-butan-1-one`). C1 is also attached to a cyclopentyl group (`1-cyclopentyl-`). There is a methyl group at C3 (`3-methyl-`). Assembling this gives: `(cyclopentyl)-C¹(=O)-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H₃`. This is more commonly named cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's search for chiral centers. The C3 atom is attached to a hydrogen, a `-CH₂C(=O)cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl groups (`-CH₃`). Since it has two identical groups attached, C3 is not a chiral center. There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Final Count:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
