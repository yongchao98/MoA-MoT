    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the description to draw the molecular structure.**\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Functional Group:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) is present. According to IUPAC priority rules, this is the highest priority group, so the parent name will be **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n3.  **Groups Meta to each other:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\"), and a cyano group (-CN) are all meta (1,3-relationship) to one another. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n4.  **Groups relative to the Carboxylic Acid:**\n    *   **Ortho:** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the -COOH group. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are on C2 and C6.\n    *   **Para:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the -COOH group. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is on C4.\n5.  **Final Positional Constraint:** The methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   We know -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   We know -CN is at C3 or C5.\n    *   If -CN were at C5, the ortho positions would be C4 and C6. This would require the -OH group to be at C6.\n    *   If -CN were at C3, the ortho positions would be C2 and C4. This would require the -OH group to be at C2.\n    *   Let's assume the -CN is at C3. This places the -OH group at C2. The remaining ortho position (C6) must have the -N(CH3)2 group, and the remaining meta position (C5) must have the -CHO group.\n\nThis gives us a unique structure:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH\n*   **C3:** -CN\n*   **C4:** -OCH3\n*   **C5:** -CHO\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2\n\n**Step 2: Determine the correct IUPAC numbering direction.**\n\nThe numbering starts at C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).\n\n*   **Numbering Clockwise (CW):** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n*   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise (CCW):** The substituents are also at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nSince both numbering directions give the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use a tie-breaking rule.\n\n*   **Careful Point (IUPAC Rule P-14.4 f):** When the locant set is identical in both directions, the direction is chosen that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent cited first as a prefix in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe first prefix alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the **cyano** group the lowest possible number.\n\n*   **Clockwise (CW):** The -CN group is at **C3**.\n*   **Counter-Clockwise (CCW):** To number counter-clockwise, C6 in our drawing becomes C2, C5 becomes C3, C4 remains C4, and C3 becomes C5. In this case, the -CN group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the final IUPAC name.**\n\nBased on the correct clockwise numbering, the locants for the substituents are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-dimethylamino\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nNow, arrange these prefixes in strict alphabetical order to form the complete name before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses often used for complex substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (This matches our derived name perfectly)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (This results from incorrect counter-clockwise numbering)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
