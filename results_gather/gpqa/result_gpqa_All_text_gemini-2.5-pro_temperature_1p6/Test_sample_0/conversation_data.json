    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle\n\nThe problem deals with the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is governed by the **Heisenberg Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle**. This principle states that it is impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and the exact time it exists in that state. The mathematical relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the energy width or natural line width).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Lifetime and Energy Width:** The uncertainty principle implies that a state with a shorter lifetime (smaller Δt) will have a larger uncertainty in its energy (larger ΔE). Conversely, a long-lived state has a more precisely defined energy.\n2.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the widths, their energy distributions will overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable. The limiting factor will be the state with the *larger* energy width.\n3.  **Constants:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. It is most convenient to use its value in units of electron-volts times seconds (eV·s):\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE1) for the first state.**\n    *   Lifetime: τ1 = Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Using the uncertainty principle (we can use ≈ ħ/τ for an order-of-magnitude estimate):\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE2) for the second state.**\n    *   Lifetime: τ2 = Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the condition for the levels to be clearly resolved.**\n    *   We have two energy widths: ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Notice that ΔE1 is ten times larger than ΔE2, which is expected since its lifetime τ1 is ten times shorter than τ2.\n    *   For the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy separation between them, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the largest of these energy uncertainties. The larger width (ΔE1) is the limiting factor.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options against this condition.**\n    *   We are looking for an energy difference that is significantly larger than approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be completely unresolved.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be unresolved.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The energy separation would be smaller than the width of the first level, so they cannot be resolved.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ is about 1500 times larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷). This separation is large enough that the energy distributions of the two states would be well separated.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe minimum energy separation required to resolve the two levels is dictated by the level with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s), which corresponds to the larger energy width (~10⁻⁷ eV). Only the energy difference given in option D (10⁻⁴ eV) is substantially larger than this required minimum, ensuring the two levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
