    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Physical Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies, which are both quantized.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** `Evib = ħω(v + 1/2)`\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **Rotational Energy:** `Erot = [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J+1)`\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n*   **Total Energy:** `E(v, J) = Evib + Erot = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J+1)`\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers for both vibration and rotation.\n    *   Lowest vibrational state: `v = 0`.\n    *   Lowest rotational state: `J = 0`.\n    *   So, the initial state is `(v, J) = (0, 0)`.\n    *   The initial energy is `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule like this (a rovibrational transition), specific selection rules must be followed:\n    *   `Δv = +1` (for absorption).\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Starting from `J = 0`, the only possible change is `ΔJ = +1`, so the new rotational state must be `J' = 1`.\n    *   Starting from `v = 0`, the new vibrational state must be `v' = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the final state is `(v', J') = (1, 1)`.\n    *   The final energy is `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n`ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n`ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n`ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I)**\n\nThe moment of inertia `I` is given by `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n\n*   **Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    `Mx = 20 amu`, `My = 2 amu`\n    `μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n    Convert `amu` to `kg`: `1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n    `μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n*   **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    `I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰) kg·m² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Total Energy Change (ΔE)**\n\nNow we substitute the values into the `ΔE` equation.\n`ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n*   **First term (vibrational):** `ħω`\n    `ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`, `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n    `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ s⁻¹) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n*   **Second term (rotational):** `ħ²/I`\n    `ħ² = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴)² ≈ 1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²`\n    `ħ²/I = (1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n*   **Total ΔE:**\n    `ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J`\n    `ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J = 4.2252 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n\nThe relationship between a photon's energy and momentum is `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light (`c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s`).\n\n*   `p = E_photon / c = ΔE / c`\n*   `p = (4.2252 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)`\n*   `p ≈ 1.4084 x 10⁻²⁸ J·s/m`\n\nThe unit `J·s/m` is equivalent to `N·s` (since `J = N·m`).\n\n*   `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\n### **Step 7: Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated momentum is approximately `1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`. This value is very close to option A.\n\nA) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nD) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe final answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
