    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves the decay of unstable particles that are moving at relativistic speeds. The two key physical principles at play are:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The number of unstable particles, `N`, that remain at time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is described by the formula `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ_mean)`, where `τ_mean` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in a frame of reference where the particle is moving. If a particle has a proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame), an observer in the lab frame will measure a dilated mean lifetime `τ_mean = γτ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**2. Formulate the Survival Fraction Equation**\n\n*   Let `f` be the fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector walls. This is `f = N/N₀`.\n*   The time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector (a distance `R = 30 m`) in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.\n*   The particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. We can therefore make the excellent approximation `v ≈ c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n*   Substituting the dilated lifetime `τ_mean = γτ` into the decay equation, we get the survival fraction in the lab frame:\n    `f = e^(-t_lab / (γτ))`\n*   Using our approximation for `t_lab`, the formula becomes:\n    `f ≈ e^(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\n**3. Analyze the Initial Scenario**\n\nWe are given the following information for the first scenario:\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`.\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n\nPlugging these values into our survival equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20τ))`\n\nThe term `(R/c)/τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's solve for this constant term. We can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)`\n`ln(3) = (R/c) / (20τ)`\n\nThis gives us an expression for our constant term: `(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Target Scenario**\n\nNow we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that will allow a different fraction of particles to reach the detector.\n*   Desired fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`.\n*   The new Lorentz factor is `γ₂` (this is what we need to find).\n\nWe use the same survival equation with the new values:\n`2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂τ)`\n\nThis gives us a second expression for the same constant term `(R/c)/τ`: `(R/c) / τ = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor `γ₂`**\n\nWe now have two different expressions for the same constant, `(R/c)/τ`. We can set them equal to each other to solve for `γ₂`:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value using the known values for natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` is extremely close to the value of 54 provided in the options.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that `v ≈ c` is crucial for simplifying the calculation. This is justified because a Lorentz factor of 20 or more means the velocity is over 99.8% the speed of light, making the approximation highly accurate.\n*   **Constant Proper Lifetime:** The problem assumes the \"new type of particles\" are all of the same type, meaning their proper lifetime `τ` is a constant in both scenarios.\n*   **Frames of Reference:** It is important to be consistent. The calculation is performed in the lab frame, where time `t_lab` and Lorentz factor `γ` are measured, but correctly uses the concept of proper lifetime `τ` as the fundamental decay constant.\n*   **Logarithm Rules:** Correct application of logarithm rules (`ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`) is essential to solving the equations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
