    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    *   The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a spheroid shape and symmetry along the z-axis.\n    *   An oscillating charge distribution is a source of electromagnetic radiation.\n    *   The most fundamental and typically dominant form of radiation from such a source is electric dipole radiation. This occurs when there is an oscillating net electric dipole moment. The symmetry of the problem (spheroid with z-axis symmetry) strongly suggests that the oscillation happens along the z-axis, creating an electric dipole oriented along the z-axis, with moment $\\vec{p}(t) = p_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{z}$. We will proceed with this standard model.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Radiated Power's Angular Dependence:**\n    *   For an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle ($dP/d\\Omega$) is given by the formula:\n        $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = K \\sin^2\\theta $$\n        where $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the dipole axis (the z-axis), and $K$ is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment, the frequency of oscillation, and fundamental constants, but not on the angle $\\theta$.\n    *   The problem states that this power per unit solid angle is a function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ and its maximum value is $A$.\n    *   To find the maximum power, we need to find the maximum value of $\\sin^2\\theta$. The maximum value of $\\sin\\theta$ is 1, which occurs at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   Therefore, the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n        $$ A = \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = K \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = K(1)^2 = K $$\n    *   So, the formula for the radiated power can be written as:\n        $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = A \\sin^2\\theta $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$:**\n    *   We need to find the value of $\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}$ at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ and express it as a fraction of the maximum power, $A$.\n    *   At $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, the power is:\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\sin^2(30^\\circ) $$\n    *   We know that $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$.\n    *   Substituting this value:\n        $$ \\left(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=30^\\circ} = A \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{A}{4} $$\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power $A$ that is radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is $(A/4) / A = 1/4$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Radiated Power's Wavelength Dependence:**\n    *   The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency of oscillation ($\\omega$). This is a key result from classical electrodynamics.\n        $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\omega^4 $$\n    *   The angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the speed of light $c$ by the equation:\n        $$ \\omega = 2\\pi\\nu = 2\\pi\\frac{c}{\\lambda} $$\n    *   Substituting this relation into the power proportionality:\n        $$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\left(\\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   Since $2\\pi c$ is a constant, the power per unit solid angle is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength:\n        $$ f(\\lambda, \\theta) = \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\lambda^{-4} $$\n        This dependence is also characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is caused by the radiation from induced dipoles.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form for the function $f(\\lambda, \\theta)$ includes a dependence on wavelength as **$\\lambda^{-4}$**.\n    *   Combining these two results, we look for the option that matches (1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$).\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 1/2, $\\lambda^{-4}$\n    *   B) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-3}$\n    *   C) 3/4, $\\lambda^{-6}$\n    *   D) 1/4, $\\lambda^{-4}$\n\n    Option D correctly matches both parts of our analysis.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Dominant Radiation Mode:** The primary assumption is that electric dipole radiation is the dominant mode. For a general oscillating charge distribution, this is usually the case unless the electric dipole moment is zero due to some symmetry, in which case higher-order multipoles (like electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole) would dominate. However, without such constraints, the electric dipole model is the standard and most fundamental one to apply.\n*   **Angular Dependence:** The $\\sin^2\\theta$ dependence is characteristic of a dipole oscillating along the axis from which $\\theta$ is measured. This gives maximum radiation perpendicular to the axis ($\\theta=90^\\circ$) and zero radiation along the axis ($\\theta=0^\\circ, 180^\\circ$).\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The $\\omega^4$ or $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence is a hallmark of dipole radiation from a source much smaller than the wavelength. This is a very general result.\n\nFinal answer is acquired by combining the fraction (1/4) and the wavelength dependence ($\\lambda^{-4}$).\n\n<<<D>>>"
