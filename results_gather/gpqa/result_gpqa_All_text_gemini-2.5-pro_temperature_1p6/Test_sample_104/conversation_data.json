    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's brightness:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Starspots):** A star with a hot, un-spotty hemisphere and a cooler, partially spotty hemisphere. As it rotates, its observed brightness changes. We need to calculate the maximum amplitude of this change.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (Exoplanet):** A hypothetical, uniformly bright star being transited by an exoplanet. The planet blocks some of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness.\n    *   **The Goal:** Find the size of the exoplanet (relative to the star) that would cause the same amplitude dip as the starspots.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Starspot Signal:**\n    *   The brightness of a star is related to its flux, which is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Flux ∝ T⁴, where T is the temperature.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (Flux_max):** This occurs when we observe the hemisphere with no spots. The entire visible disk radiates at the star's effective temperature, T_star. So, Flux_max ∝ T_star⁴.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (Flux_min):** This occurs when we observe the hemisphere with spots. A fraction of the visible disk's area, the filling factor `f`, is covered by cooler spots at temperature T_spot, while the remaining area (1 - f) radiates at T_star.\n        *   T_star = 6000 K\n        *   T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K\n        *   Filling Factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n    *   The combined flux from this mixed-temperature surface is: Flux_min ∝ [ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ].\n    *   **Amplitude Calculation:** The amplitude of the signal is the fractional change in flux from maximum to minimum brightness.\n        *   Amplitude = (Flux_max - Flux_min) / Flux_max\n        *   Substituting the proportionalities: Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - [ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴ ]) / T_star⁴\n        *   Simplifying the numerator: Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴\n        *   Amplitude = (f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴\n        *   Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴)) = f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴ ]\n    *   **Plug in the values:**\n        *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\n        *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n        *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (625 / 1296) ]\n        *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [ (1296 - 625) / 1296 ]\n        *   Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 671 / 1296 ] ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Exoplanet Signal (Transit Depth):**\n    *   When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   Area of the planet's disk = π * R_pl²\n    *   Area of the star's disk = π * R_star²\n    *   The amplitude of the transit signal (also known as the transit depth) is:\n        *   Amplitude = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n        *   Amplitude = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n4.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the two signals must have the same amplitude.\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n    *   To find the relative radius, we take the square root of this value.\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value of R_pl / R_star is approximately 0.32.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The calculation relies on the flux being proportional to the fourth power of temperature (T⁴). This is a fundamental principle for blackbody radiation, which is a good approximation for stars.\n*   **Filling Factor:** The interpretation of the \"filling factor\" is key. We assume `f=0.20` represents the fraction of the projected disk area that is covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. This is the standard interpretation for such problems.\n*   **Amplitude Definition:** The signal amplitude is the *relative* change in flux, (F_max - F_min) / F_max. This normalization allows us to cancel out constants and distances, focusing only on the intrinsic properties of the star and planet.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit Formula:** The formula for transit depth, (R_pl/R_star)², is a cornerstone of exoplanet studies. It assumes a dark planet transiting a uniformly bright star. The problem explicitly tells us to use this simplified model for the comparison.\n*   **Final Step:** Don't forget to take the square root. A common mistake is to equate the amplitude from the spots (0.10355) directly with the radius ratio (R_pl/R_star) instead of the radius ratio squared.\n\n<<<C>>>"
