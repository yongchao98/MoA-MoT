    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    The problem involves two inertial frames of reference as per the Special Theory of Relativity.\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We are asked to find the distance in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame. Time is measured in this frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the ejecta's reference frame (the moving frame S') is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** because it's the time measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light in a vacuum is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    We need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame (the stationary frame S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:**\n    Since the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the principles of Special Relativity. Specifically, the concept of **time dilation** is crucial here. An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for the event than the observer in the moving frame (the ejecta).\n\n5.  **Lay out the Calculation Plan:**\n    *   **First,** we need to calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) corresponding to the 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) that passed in the ejecta's frame. This is done using the time dilation formula.\n    *   **Second,** once we have the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance `Δx` traveled in that frame using the standard formula: distance = speed × time.\n\n### Performing the Calculation\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (`Δt`)**\n\n*   The formula for time dilation is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   **Calculate `v/c`:**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Calculate `(v/c)²`:**\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\n*   **Calculate `γ`:**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Calculate `Δt`:**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (`Δx`)**\n\n*   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `Δx = v * Δt`.\n*   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n    `Δx = (60,000 km/s) * [ (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n\n*   Combine the numerical terms:\n    `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / √(0.96) km`\n    `Δx = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    `√(0.96) ≈ 0.979796`\n    `Δx ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km`\n    `Δx ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**Part 3: Compare with the Options**\n\n*   The calculated value is `≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n*   Looking at the options:\n    A) 3,060,000 km\n    B) 2,880,000 km\n    C) 2,940,000 km\n    D) 3,000,000 km\n*   The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The small difference is due to the rounding of the value in the option.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** It is essential to correctly identify the 50 seconds as the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the rest frame of the \"clock\" (the ejecta).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always longer than the proper time (`Δt > Δt₀`). Failing to apply time dilation and using `Δt = 50 s` would give the non-relativistic answer `60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option D), which is incorrect.\n*   **Correct Frame for Distance:** The question asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame, so the calculation must use the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n\nThe final calculation is `Δx = v * γ * Δt₀`, which leads to the answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
