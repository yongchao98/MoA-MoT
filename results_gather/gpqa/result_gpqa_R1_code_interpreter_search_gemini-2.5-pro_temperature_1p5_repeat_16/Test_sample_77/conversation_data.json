    "This problem requires the expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are famously known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Setup**\n\n*   A point charge `q` is moving along a path $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   We want to find the potentials at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and at a specific time `t`.\n*   Electromagnetic fields and potentials propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potential we observe at time `t` was actually generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n*   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the condition that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly `t - tr`.\n*   Let the position of the charge at the retarded time be $\\vec{s}(tr)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point is given as $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$.\n*   The distance the signal traveled is the magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   The time for the signal to travel this distance is $d/c$.\n*   Therefore, the retarded time condition is: $t - tr = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is given as $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ evaluated at $t' = tr$.\n\n### **2. Deriving the Potentials**\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are the retarded potentials evaluated for a point charge source.\n\nThe general expressions for the retarded potentials for a charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nwhere $t_r = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$ is the retarded time for each source point $\\vec{r}'$.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position $\\vec{s}(t')$, the distributions are:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them (which involves a subtle change of variables from $d^3r'$ to $dt'$) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe standard result for the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{ret}$\nThe subscript 'ret' signifies that all quantities in the bracket (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTo match the form in the options, we can factor out `1/c` from the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, the standard result for the vector potential is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{dc})} \\right]_{ret}$\n\nUsing the same simplification for the denominator:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n### **3. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** Incorrect form for both V and A. These are not retarded potentials.\n*   **B)** Incorrect form for V (it's the static potential). The relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, but the potential V is wrong.\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n*   **D)** Incorrect sign in the denominator. The term correcting for the motion of the source, $\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}$, is subtracted, not added.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
