    "The user wants to find the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Interaction Lagrangian:**\n    The interaction between the boson X and a fermion-antifermion pair $(\\psi_f, \\bar{\\psi}_f)$ is given by the term:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}_{int-decay} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y) $$\n    This term describes a vertex where the boson X couples to a fermion $f$ and its antiparticle $\\bar{f}$. This means the boson X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair: $X \\rightarrow f \\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Kinematic Condition:**\n    For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial decaying particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products.\n    The mass of the initial particle is $m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    The decay products are a fermion $f$ and its antifermion $\\bar{f}$. A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, so $m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$.\n    The kinematic condition is:\n    $$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\n    $$ m_X > 2 m_f $$\n    Substituting the given mass of X:\n    $$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2 m_f $$\n    $$ m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\n    Therefore, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ as long as the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than 3 GeV.\n\n3.  **Check Fermion Masses:**\n    We need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy the condition $m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV}$. The masses are approximately:\n\n    *   **Leptons:**\n        *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not allowed**.\n        *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not allowed**.\n\n    (Note: Neutrinos also have mass, but they are extremely small and their interactions are very weak, so they are typically omitted from such lists unless specified.)\n\n4.  **Consolidate Allowed Decays and Compare with Options:**\n    The kinematically allowed decay channels are:\n    $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$, $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$, $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$, $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$, $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. Incorrect, as it includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ channel.\n    B) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. Incorrect, includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and misses allowed channels.\n    C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This list perfectly matches our derived set of allowed decays.\n    D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. Incorrect, as it includes the forbidden $t\\bar{t}$ channel.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
