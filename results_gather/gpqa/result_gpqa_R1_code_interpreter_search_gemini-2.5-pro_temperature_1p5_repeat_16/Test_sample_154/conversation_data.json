    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a specific quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation, which is calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n    So, for this problem, I need to calculate:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Plan the Calculation Steps:**\n    a.  First, calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    b.  Second, calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$. This requires finding the matrix for $P_z^2$ first.\n    c.  Finally, substitute these values into the uncertainty formula to find $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation (Manual Approach):**\n\n    *   **Step 4a: Calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n        -   First, I need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all elements are real, it's just the transpose:\n            $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        -   Next, calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n            $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        -   Now, compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n            $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n            $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n        -   First, find the matrix for $P_z^2$:\n            $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        -   Calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n            $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        -   Compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n            $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n            $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Calculate $\\Delta P_z$**\n        -   Substitute the calculated values into the formula:\n            $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2 - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n6.  **Verify the Calculation using a Python script:** To ensure accuracy, I will write a simple Python script using NumPy to perform the matrix calculations. This automates the process and reduces the chance of manual arithmetic errors. The script will define the vectors and matrices and compute the expectation values and the final uncertainty. For calculation purposes, $\\hbar$ is set to 1, and then added back to the final numerical result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar=1 for simplicity in calculation.
