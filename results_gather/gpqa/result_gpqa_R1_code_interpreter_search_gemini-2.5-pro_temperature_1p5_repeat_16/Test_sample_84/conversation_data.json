    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe can write the equilibrium temperatures for both planets:\n$T_{eq,1} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}$\n$T_{eq,2} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}$\n\nNow, let's find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_1)}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{R_{star}/(2a_2)}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The star's properties ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) are also the same for both planets. Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nSo, the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) for a specific spectral line ($\\lambda_0$), which is used to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_{star}$).\n$K_{star} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude for a star with a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$K_{star} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star} + M_p} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star}+M_p)}{a}}$\nWhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n\nSince the planets are detected via the transit method, the inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, making $\\sin i \\approx 1$. Also, the planet masses ($5-7 M_{earth}$) are much smaller than the star's mass ($1.5 M_{sun}$), so we can approximate $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$.\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$K_{star} \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K_{star} \\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K_{star}^2 M_{star}}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 G / (K_{star,2}^2 M_{star})}{M_1^2 G / (K_{star,1}^2 M_{star})}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constants and cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_{star,2}^2}{M_1^2 / K_{star,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}}\\right)^2$\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nLet's compute the ratios for mass and RV semi-amplitude.\n*   **Mass Ratio**:\n    $\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{earth}}{7 \\ M_{earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio**:\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K_{star}$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta \\lambda$ (since $K_{star} = c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0$). Therefore, the ratio of $K_{star}$ values is the same as the ratio of the $\\Delta\\lambda$ values.\n    $\\frac{K_{star,1}}{K_{star,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of $a_2 / a_1$ back into our temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n\nWe can compute the square roots of the numerator and the denominator:\n$\\sqrt{225} = 15$\n$\\sqrt{784} = 28$\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**8. Final Calculation**\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\nThe superfluous information (star's radius, temperature, and planets' radii) was not needed for the calculation as they cancel out in the ratio.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2)\n# This is equivalent to the ratio of the Doppler shifts (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n<<<\n```\n0.5357142857142857\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). The star's properties ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$) are also constant. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2 / a_1$). We can determine this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, $K$, for a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$) is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\nWhere $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nLet's solve this for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}^2} \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can set up the ratio for $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 G / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{M_1^2 G / (K_1^2 M_{star})}$\nThe constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_2^2 / K_2^2}{M_1^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$), so the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nWe are also given the masses of the planets: $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$ and $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$. The mass ratio is:\n$\\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
