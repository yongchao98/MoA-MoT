    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Solar Neutrino Sources:**\n    The Sun produces neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III), and to a lesser extent, the CNO cycle. We need to identify the energy of the neutrinos produced by each relevant process.\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces \"pp\" neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to 420 keV.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** Involves the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`). This produces mono-energetic neutrinos, with the vast majority (~90%) having an energy of **861 keV**. The total flux of these neutrinos is very high, approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** Involves the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νe`). This produces \"Boron-8\" neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. The total flux is much lower, around 5 x 10⁶ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces neutrinos from `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decay, both having continuous spectra with endpoints at 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. The total CNO flux is significant, around 7 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:**\n    The problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. This means the production of **Boron-8 (`⁸B`) neutrinos ceases**. All other reaction rates, including the pp-II chain (`⁷Be` neutrinos) and the CNO cycle, remain the same.\n\n3.  **Identify Neutrino Contributions in Each Energy Band:**\n    We need to determine which neutrino sources contribute to the specified energy bands under this new condition (no `⁸B` neutrinos).\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: No (energy is too low, < 420 keV).\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: No (the line is at 861 keV).\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: No (this source is turned off).\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos: **Yes**. The continuous spectra of both `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` cover this energy range.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The flux is entirely due to CNO neutrinos.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos: No.\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos: **Yes**. The very strong, mono-energetic line at **861 keV** falls squarely in this band.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos: No (turned off).\n        *   `CNO` neutrinos: **Yes**. Their continuous spectra also cover this range.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is a sum of the `⁷Be` line flux and the continuous CNO flux in this energy window.\n\n4.  **Compare Flux Magnitudes and Formulate the Ratio:**\n    Let's compare the size of the contributing fluxes.\n    *   The `⁷Be` line flux is enormous (`~5 x 10⁹ /cm²/s`) and is fully contained within Band 2.\n    *   The CNO flux is continuous. The flux integrated over the small 100 keV window of Band 2 will be a very small fraction of the total CNO flux. It will be many orders of magnitude smaller than the `⁷Be` line flux.\n    *   Therefore, the total flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the `⁷Be` neutrinos: `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux(⁷Be)`.\n    *   The flux in Band 1 is solely from the CNO neutrinos integrated over that 100 keV window: `Flux(Band 1) = Flux(CNO in band)`.\n\n    A direct calculation would involve integrating the CNO spectrum over Band 1 and dividing by the total `⁷Be` flux. This results in a very small number (on the order of 10⁻⁴), which is not among the options.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question's Intent (Conceptual Approach):**\n    Given the multiple-choice options are round numbers (1, 10, 0.1, 0.01), this suggests the question is not about precise calculation but about a conceptual, order-of-magnitude comparison of the relevant physical processes.\n    *   The problem setup effectively isolates the **CNO cycle** as the source for Band 1 and the **pp-II (`⁷Be`) cycle** as the dominant source for Band 2.\n    *   It is therefore highly probable that the question is asking for the approximate ratio of the overall strengths of these two sources, i.e., the ratio of their total fluxes.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Total Fluxes:**\n    *   Characteristic Flux for Band 1 = Total CNO Flux (`F_CNO`) ≈ 7 x 10⁸ /cm²/s.\n    *   Characteristic Flux for Band 2 = Total `⁷Be` Flux (`F_⁷Be`) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ /cm²/s.\n\n    The required ratio is `Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)`, which we interpret as `F_CNO / F_⁷Be`:\n\n    Ratio ≈ (7 x 10⁸) / (5 x 10⁹) = 7 / 50 = 0.14\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The calculated ratio of ~0.14 is very close to 0.1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
