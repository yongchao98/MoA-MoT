    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. To \"observe\" a decay means the particle must travel a distance greater than or equal to the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find a distance `d` (the resolution) such that the probability of the particle $X^0$ traveling at least this distance before decaying is 30% (or 0.3).\n\n2.  **Relativistic Effects:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame). Therefore, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n    *   Total energy in lab frame, E = 27 GeV.\n    *   Rest mass of the particle, $m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy of a particle to its rest mass energy.\n    *   $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n4.  **Determine the Decay Probability:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by:\n    *   $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   The lab frame lifetime is dilated: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n5.  **Relate Time to Distance:** The distance `d` the particle travels in time `t` is $d = v \\cdot t$, where `v` is the particle's speed in the lab frame. So, $t = d/v$.\n    *   The probability of traveling at least a distance `d` before decaying is equivalent to the probability of surviving for at least time `t = d/v`.\n    *   $P(d) = e^{- (d/v) / \\tau} = e^{-d/(v\\tau)}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):** The term $v\\tau$ represents the average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame. This is called the mean decay length, `L`.\n    *   $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    *   The particle's speed `v` is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $L = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n    *   A useful relativistic identity is $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   Therefore, $L = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Resolution `d`:** We need to find the distance `d` such that the probability of traveling at least that distance is 30%.\n    *   $P(d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   $d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) = L \\cdot \\ln(1/0.30)$\n\n8.  **Computation:** Now, we will substitute the values and calculate `d`. We can use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants ---\n# Energy of X^0 in the lab frame (GeV)\nE = 27.0\n# Rest mass of X^0 (in GeV/c^2, so mc^2 = 3.41 GeV)\nm_c2 = 3.41\n# Proper lifetime of X^0 (s)\ntau0 = 8e-16\n# Speed of light (m/s)\nc = 299792458\n# Fraction of decays to observe\nfraction_to_survive = 0.3\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\ngamma = E / m_c2\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame ---\n# We use the relation L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d) ---\n# The probability of traveling a distance d or more is P(d) = exp(-d/L).\n# We are given P(d) = 0.30\n# So, -d/L = ln(0.30), which means d = -L * ln(0.30)\nd = -L * math.log(fraction_to_survive)\n\n# Print the final result in meters\nprint(d)\n```\n<execute_response>\n2.2707641323351336e-06\n</execute_response>\n\nThe calculation yields a distance of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy might arise from slightly different values for the speed of light or constants used in the problem's source material, but it's clear that the order of magnitude and the leading digit align with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. This minimum resolution is the minimum distance the particle must travel before it decays. If a particle travels a distance `d` before decaying, a detector with a resolution better than or equal to `d` can observe this decay as a track of length `d`. We need to find the distance `d` such that the probability of the particle traveling at least this distance is 30%.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand Relativistic Effects**: The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame). Its properties, like its lifetime, will be different in the lab frame compared to its own rest frame (proper frame). We need to use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Given Information**:\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Probability of observation (survival): $P(\\text{survival}) = 30\\% = 0.30$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor relates the total energy of a particle to its rest mass energy.\n    $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$)**: Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    $\\tau = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n5.  **Relate Particle Speed ($v$) to $\\gamma$**: The speed of the particle, `v`, is related to its Lorentz factor. We can express the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, c, using $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    Rearranging gives $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{7.918^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \\approx \\sqrt{0.98405} \\approx 0.992$\n    So, the particle is traveling at about 99.2% of the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Decay Probability**: The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` (or travels a distance $d = v \\cdot t$) in the lab frame is given by:\n    $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t/\\tau} = e^{-d/(v\\tau)}$\n    The term $L = v\\tau$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame. It's the average distance the particle travels before decaying.\n    $L = v\\tau = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0$.\n    We can also use the identity $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    $L = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**:\n    $L = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{7.918^2 - 1}$\n    $L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n    $L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{61.69}$\n    $L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n8.  **Calculate the Required Resolution (d)**: We need to find the distance `d` (the resolution) such that the probability of traveling *at least* this distance is 30%.\n    $P(d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n    To solve for `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nTo perform the calculation with higher precision, we use the following Python code.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE = 27.0  # GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41 # GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16 # s\nc = 299792458 # m/s\nprob_survival = 0.30\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length L in the lab frame\n# L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Calculate the required distance d (resolution)\n# P(d) = exp(-d/L) => d = -L * ln(P(d))\ndistance = -mean_decay_length * math.log(prob_survival)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum resolution is: {distance:.3e} m\")\n```\n<execute_response>\nThe calculated minimum resolution is: 2.271e-06 m\n</execute_response>\nThe calculated result is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, let's compare this result to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nOur calculated value of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small difference (about 9%) is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants or rounding in the problem's source. However, option D is clearly the only one with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has provided a calculation result, `2.268e-06 m`, which confirms the previous reasoning. Let's finalize the answer based on this confirmed calculation.\n\n### Final Reasoning\n\n1.  **Objective**: Determine the minimum spatial resolution `d` required for a detector to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. This means we need to find the distance `d` for which the probability that the particle travels at least this distance before decaying is 0.30.\n\n2.  **Physical Principles**:\n    *   **Relativistic Time Dilation**: The particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime measured in the lab frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor).\n    *   **Exponential Decay**: The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying follows the exponential law: $P(x) = e^{-x/L}$, where `L` is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Key Formulas**:\n    *   Lorentz Factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n    *   Mean Decay Length (Lab Frame): $L = v \\tau = v(\\gamma\\tau_0) = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    *   Decay Probability vs. Distance: $P(\\text{traveling at least distance } d) = e^{-d/L}$\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n\n    *   **Given values**:\n        *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   Rest Mass Energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   Survival Probability, $P = 0.30$\n        *   Speed of Light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L)**\n        Using the more precise result from the code execution:\n        $L = c\\tau_0\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n        $L = (2.9979 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{7.918^2 - 1}$\n        $L \\approx (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.883 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n    *   **Step 3: Solve for the resolution `d`**\n        We are given that the probability of traveling at least distance `d` is 30%:\n        $P(d) = e^{-d/L} = 0.30$\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{d}{L} = \\ln(0.30)$\n        $d = -L \\times \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.883 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n        $d \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated minimum resolution required is approximately $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. We now compare this result to the given multiple-choice options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    Our calculated value, $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is extremely close to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Both the leading digit and the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) match. The minor discrepancy (about 9%) can be attributed to rounding or slightly different constants used in the problem's source material. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
