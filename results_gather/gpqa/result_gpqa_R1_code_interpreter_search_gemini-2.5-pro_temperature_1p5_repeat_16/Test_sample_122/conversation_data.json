    "Here's my thinking process to solve this special relativity problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the distance the supernova ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   There are two inertial frames of reference: the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy.\n    *   The relative velocity (`v`) between these two frames is 60,000 km/s. This is given from the perspective of the ejecta, but due to the principle of relativity, the magnitude of the velocity is the same from the Galaxy's perspective.\n    *   A time interval of 50 seconds (`Δt_ejecta`) is measured in the ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   The speed of light (`c`) is a universal constant, approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Recognize the Core Physics Principle:** Since the velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c = 300,000 km/s`), the effects of special relativity, specifically time dilation, must be considered.\n\n4.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Moving Frame:** The ejecta's frame. Time measured here is the \"proper time\" (`Δt_0`) because the \"clock\" (in this case, the 50-second interval) is at rest in this frame. So, `Δt_0 = 50 s`.\n    *   **Stationary Frame:** The Galaxy's frame. An observer in the Galaxy sees the ejecta's clock running slower. The time measured in this frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    *   **Time Dilation Formula:** The relationship between time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt_0`) is given by:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt_0`\n    *   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The factor `γ` depends on the relative velocity `v`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   **Distance Formula:** The distance traveled in a given frame is the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame. We need the distance in the Galaxy frame (`d_galaxy`), so we'll use the time measured in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`).\n        `d_galaxy = v * Δt`\n\n6.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the velocity ratio (v/c).**\n        `v = 60,000 km/s`\n        `c = 300,000 km/s`\n        `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt_0 = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d_galaxy).**\n        `d_galaxy = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        `d_galaxy = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d_galaxy = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Use a Calculator/Code for the Final Computation:** The expression `3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)` needs to be evaluated precisely. I will use a Python script for this.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s, speed of light\nt0 = 50    # s, proper time in the ejecta's frame\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (dilated time)\n# First, calculate the Lorentz factor, gamma\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Now, calculate the dilated time t\nt_galaxy = gamma * t0\n\n# Finally, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_galaxy:.0f}\")\n```\n8.  **Analyze the Output:** The code will execute and provide the result.\n<execute_output>\n3061862\n</execute_output>\nThe result is `3061862` km.\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value, `3,061,862 km`, is extremely close to option A, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options. Option A is the best fit.\n\n10. **Final Check:**\n    *   The concept is time dilation: time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is longer than in the moving frame (ejecta).\n    *   `Δt = 50 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 51.03 s`.\n    *   This dilated time is longer than 50 s, which is correct.\n    *   Distance = velocity * dilated time = `60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   If we were to incorrectly use the proper time (50 s), the distance would be `60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). This is the \"classical\" answer and ignores relativity.\n    *   If we were to mix up the frames and calculate length contraction instead (which is not what the question asks), the calculation would be different. The question is straightforward: what is distance = velocity * time, using the time appropriate for the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The logic and calculations are sound. Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n*   **Frame 1 (Moving Frame):** The supernova ejecta. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" because the clock measuring the interval is at rest in this frame.\n    *   Proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Frame 2 (Stationary Frame):** The Galaxy. We are asked to find the distance as measured from this frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (`c`):** The speed of light is a constant, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Determine the Relevant Physics Principle**\nThe velocity of the ejecta is a significant fraction of the speed of light:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\nBecause this ratio is not negligible, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically **time dilation**.\n\n**3. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nTime dilation describes how time in a moving frame is observed to pass more slowly from a stationary frame. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n\nThe formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n*   First, calculate `v²/c²`:\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\nUsing the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**\nThe distance traveled in a given frame is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed *in that same frame*. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy frame (`d`), so we must use the time calculated for the Galaxy frame (`Δt`).\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nNow, let's calculate the final value:\n`sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n*   The calculated value is `3,061,862 km`.\n*   The given options are:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated result `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option A, `3,060,000 km`. The slight difference is due to rounding in the problem's provided answers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
