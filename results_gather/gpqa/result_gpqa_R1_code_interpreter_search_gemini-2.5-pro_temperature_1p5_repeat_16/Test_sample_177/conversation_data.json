    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions in Quantum Field Theory\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S$ is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = [Mass]^{-4}$.\nSince the action $S$ is dimensionless, i.e., $[S]=0$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4 to compensate:\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = [Mass]^4$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Mass Dimension of each term in the Lagrangian\n\nWe need to find the mass dimension of the fields $\\psi$ and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ and the matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Fermion Field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion field is given by the Dirac Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{Dirac} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. The dimension of this Lagrangian density must be 4. Let's analyze the dimension of the kinetic part $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has the dimension of momentum, so $[\\partial_\\mu] = [Mass]^1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constants.\n    *   We have $[\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu)\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + [\\partial_\\mu] = [Mass]^4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we can write $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$.\n    *   Solving for $[\\psi]$, we get $2[\\psi] = 3$, so $[\\psi] = [Mass]^{3/2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the fermion field $\\psi$ (and $\\bar{\\psi}$) is $3/2$.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is given by the Maxwell Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{Maxwell} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this Lagrangian density must also be 4.\n    *   So, $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = [Mass]^4$.\n    *   Taking the square root, we find the mass dimension of the field strength tensor to be $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [Mass]^2$.\n\n*   **Sigma Matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: The matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [Mass]^0$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Mass Dimension of $\\kappa$\n\nNow we use the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. The dimension of this term must also be 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [Mass]^4$.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [Mass]^{3/2} \\cdot [Mass]^0 \\cdot [Mass]^{3/2} \\cdot [Mass]^2 = [Mass]^4$.\n\nCombining the exponents:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [Mass]^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = [Mass]^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [Mass]^{3 + 2} = [Mass]^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [Mass]^5 = [Mass]^4$.\n\nTo solve for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$, we have:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{[Mass]^4}{[Mass]^5} = [Mass]^{-1}$.\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### 4. Determine the Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   **Super-renormalizable**: If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is positive ($[g] > 0$).\n*   **Renormalizable**: If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is zero ($[g] = 0$). Examples include the electric charge $e$ in QED.\n*   **Non-renormalizable**: If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative ($[g] < 0$).\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and its mass dimension is $[\\kappa] = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nIn a non-renormalizable theory, higher-order loop corrections in perturbation theory introduce divergences that become progressively worse at each order. An infinite number of counterterms would be needed to cancel these infinities, stripping the theory of its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
