    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Positional Visibility**: The star must be observable from the locations of both observatories. A star can be observed if it rises above the horizon.\n2.  **Brightness**: The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the observational limit of *both* instruments.\n\nFirst, let's establish the criteria.\n\n### 1. Positional Visibility\nAn object is visible from an observatory at latitude `lat` if its declination `dec` satisfies the following conditions:\n*   For a Northern Hemisphere observatory (`lat > 0`), the object must have `dec > lat - 90°`.\n*   For a Southern Hemisphere observatory (`lat < 0`), the object must have `dec < lat + 90°`.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory**: Located in Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately **+19.8° N**.\n    *   For a star to be visible from Keck, its declination must be:\n        `dec > 19.8° - 90°`\n        `dec > -70.2°`\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory**: Located in Chile, at a latitude of approximately **-24.6° S**.\n    *   For a star to be visible from Paranal, its declination must be:\n        `dec < -24.6° + 90°`\n        `dec < +65.4°`\n\nTherefore, for a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the range **-70.2° < dec < +65.4°**.\n\n### 2. Brightness\nThe instruments have the following magnitude limits:\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude `V < 17`.\n*   **HIRES (Keck)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude `V < 16`.\n\nTo be detected by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is **V < 16.0**.\n\n### 3. Star Analysis\n\nLet's check each star against these two criteria.\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **DEC = -75°**\n*   **Visibility**: Is -75° within the range (-70.2°, +65.4°)? **No**, it is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion**: Not detectable by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **DEC = +55°**\n*   **Visibility**: Is +55° within the range (-70.2°, +65.4°)? **Yes**.\n*   **Brightness**: The apparent V magnitude is given as **16.5 mag**. Is 16.5 < 16.0? **No**, it is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion**: Not detectable by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **DEC = +48°**\n*   **Visibility**: Is +48° within the range (-70.2°, +65.4°)? **Yes**.\n*   **Brightness**: The apparent V magnitude is given as **15.5 mag**. Is 15.5 < 16.0? **Yes**.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Detectable by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **DEC = -48°**\n*   **Visibility**: Is -48° within the range (-70.2°, +65.4°)? **Yes**.\n*   **Brightness**: We need to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (Mv = 15.5), distance (d = 10 pc), and color excess (E(B-V) = 0.4).\n    *   The formula is `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_v`, where `A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n    *   First, calculate the absorption `A_v = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`.\n    *   Now, calculate the apparent magnitude: `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * (1) - 5 + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**`.\n    *   Is 16.74 < 16.0? **No**, it is too faint.\n*   **Conclusion**: Not detectable by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **DEC = +60°**\n*   **Visibility**: Is +60° within the range (-70.2°, +65.4°)? **Yes**.\n*   **Brightness**: We need to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (Mv = 16.5) and distance (d = 5 pc). There is no extinction.\n    *   The formula is `V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `V ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5`\n    *   `V ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**`.\n    *   Is 14.995 < 16.0? **Yes**.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Detectable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star 3** and **Star 5** can be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
