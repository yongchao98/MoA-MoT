    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical system:** The potential is given as $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all directions.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this potential can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The Hamiltonian is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2+y^2+z^2)$\n    This can be separated into three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillators:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x_i^2$.\n\n3.  **Recall the energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator:** The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy for the 3D system:** The total energy is the sum of the energies from the three independent dimensions:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x,n_y,n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n5.  **Identify the energy levels (ground state, excited states):** The energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. So, the energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n    *   **Ground state:** This is the lowest possible energy state, which occurs when $N=0$.\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First excited state:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $N=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second excited state:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third excited state:** This is the state we are interested in, corresponding to $N=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the degeneracy of the third excited state:** The degeneracy is the number of different quantum states (combinations of $n_x, n_y, n_z$) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find how many combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    We can enumerate the possibilities:\n    *   Combinations with 3: (3, 0, 0). These can be arranged in 3 ways: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n    *   Combinations with 2 and 1: (2, 1, 0). These can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n    *   Combinations with 1: (1, 1, 1). This is only 1 unique combination.\n\n    Total number of combinations (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the standard formula for the degeneracy of the $N$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n    This confirms that there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.\n\n7.  **Compare the results with the given options:**\n    *   Energy of the third excited state: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   Number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10.\n\n    This matches option C. The energy expressions in options A and B are characteristic of a particle in an infinite spherical potential well, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\nTo be absolutely sure of the combinations, we can use a simple python script to find them.\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nN = 3  # For the third excited state\ncount = 0\ncombinations = []\n\n# Find all non-negative integer solutions for nx + ny + nz = N\nfor nx in range(N + 1):\n    for ny in range(N + 1 - nx):\n        nz = N - nx - ny\n        # Add the set of unique permutations for this solution\n        for p in set(itertools.permutations([nx, ny, nz])):\n            if p not in combinations:\n                combinations.append(p)\n                count += 1\n                \nprint(f\"The energy level is N = {N}\")\nprint(f\"The degeneracy (number of independent eigenfunctions) is {count}\")\nprint(\"The possible states (nx, ny, nz) are:\")\nfor combo in sorted(combinations):\n    print(combo)\n\n```\n>>>\nThe energy level is N = 3\nThe degeneracy (number of independent eigenfunctions) is 10\nThe possible states (nx, ny, nz) are:\n(0, 0, 3)\n(0, 1, 2)\n(0, 2, 1)\n(0, 3, 0)\n(1, 0, 2)\n(1, 1, 1)\n(1, 2, 0)\n(2, 0, 1)\n(2, 1, 0)\n(3, 0, 0)\n>>>\nThe calculation is confirmed by the python script. The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\nFinal answer corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
