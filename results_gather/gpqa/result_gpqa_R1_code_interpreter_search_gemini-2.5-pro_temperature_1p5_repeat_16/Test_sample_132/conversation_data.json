    "This problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in a buffer solution. Let's break down the problem into logical steps.\n\n**1. Understand the components of the solution:**\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n*   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n*   In water, Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 H2O.\n*   The key species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, which form a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\n**2. Calculate the molar amounts of the buffer components:**\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4-) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (which gives HPO4^2-) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n*   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm3, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n*   Concentration of H2PO4- = (Moles of KH2PO4) / (Volume in L)\n*   Concentration of HPO4^2- = (Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O) / (Volume in L)\n\n**4. Determine the pH and [H+] of the buffer solution:**\n*   The solution is a buffer controlled by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but it's more direct to use the Ka2 expression:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n*   Rearranging to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\n**5. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-):**\n*   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n*   The equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n*   The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n*   Rearranging to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n*   We can use the concentrations of [HPO4^2-] and [H+] determined in the previous steps. Because Ka3 is extremely small, the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible, and the H+ concentration is effectively set by the buffer.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.20000  # L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Calculate initial concentrations\n# Moles of KH2PO4 provides H2PO4-\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\n\n# Moles of Na2HPO4*2H2O provides HPO4^2-\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\npo4_3minus_conc = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / h_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final concentration in scientific notation, matching the format of the options.\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.24x10^-7 M for the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-). Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 2.81x10^-7 M\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M\nC) 3.97x10^-7 M\nD) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles:**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   KH2PO4 dissolves in water to produce K+ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-). H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolves to produce Na+ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-). HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   These two species, H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, create a buffer solution. The equilibrium governing this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles. This is the number of moles of H2PO4-.\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles. This is the number of moles of HPO4^2-.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:**\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka2:\n        Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [H+]:\n        [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n        [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n    *   The equilibrium expression is:\n        Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]. We use the [H+] calculated from the buffer equilibrium and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is negligible):\n        [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n        [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11x10^-8 M) ≈ 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nThis result matches the one calculated by the Python script.\n\n<<<D>>>"
