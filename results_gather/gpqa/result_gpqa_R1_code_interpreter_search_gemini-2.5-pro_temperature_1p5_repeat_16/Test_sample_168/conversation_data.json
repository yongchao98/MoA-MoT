    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Original Decay (Process 1)\n\n*   **Reaction:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n*   **Key Feature:** The energy spectrum of the two E particles is **continuous**.\n*   **Reasoning:** In any particle decay, the total energy and momentum are conserved. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the two A particles (assuming they are at rest), `E_initial = 2 * m_A * c^2`. The final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies and kinetic energies of all final particles: `E_final = (2*m_B*c^2 + K_{2B}) + (2*m_E*c^2 + K_{2E}) + (2*m_V*c^2 + K_{2V})`.\n*   The total kinetic energy released, `Q_1`, is shared among the final particles:\n    `Q_1 = K_{2B} + K_{2E} + K_{2V} = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c^2`.\n*   Since the A and B particles are \"heavy nucleons,\" their recoil kinetic energy `K_{2B}` is very small and can be neglected. So, `Q_1 ≈ K_{2E} + K_{2V}`.\n*   The spectrum of the energy of the E particles (`K_{2E}`) is continuous because the available energy `Q_1` is shared between the E particles and the V particles. The V particles can carry away any amount of kinetic energy from zero up to `Q_1`, meaning the energy left for the E particles can also vary continuously. This is a characteristic of a \"three-body decay\" or a decay with more than two particles in the final state.\n\n### 2. Determine the Endpoint of the Original Spectrum (Q)\n\n*   The problem states the endpoint of the E-particle energy spectrum is `Q`. This endpoint corresponds to the maximum possible energy the two E particles can have.\n*   This maximum, `(K_{2E})_max`, occurs when the other light particles (the two V particles) carry away the minimum possible kinetic energy, which is zero (`K_{2V} = 0`).\n*   Therefore, the endpoint `Q` is equal to the total available kinetic energy `Q_1`:\n    `Q = (K_{2E})_max = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c^2`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Variant Decay (Process 2)\n\n*   **Reaction:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n*   **Key Feature:** The two V particles are replaced by a single **massless** particle M (`m_M = 0`).\n*   **Nature of the Spectrum:** The total kinetic energy `Q_2` is now shared between the B particles, the E particles, and the M particle: `Q_2 = K_{2B} + K_{2E} + K_M`.\n*   Again, neglecting the recoil `K_{2B}`, we have `Q_2 ≈ K_{2E} + K_M`.\n*   Since the energy is shared between the E particles and the M particle, the energy of the E particles (`K_{2E}`) is still not fixed. The M particle can carry away a variable amount of energy. Therefore, the energy spectrum for the E particles **remains continuous**. This eliminates options A and C.\n*   The shape of the spectrum will be different because the \"phase space\" (the volume of available momentum states for the final particles) has changed. The original decay involved five final particles (nucleus B, 2 E, 2 V), while the variant involves four (nucleus B, 2 E, M). This change in the number of particles sharing the energy modifies the statistical distribution, hence the spectrum has an \"adjusted shape\".\n\n### 4. Determine the Endpoint of the Variant Spectrum (Q')\n\n*   The new endpoint, `Q'`, is the maximum kinetic energy the two E particles can have in the variant decay. This occurs when the particle M carries away zero kinetic energy (`K_M = 0`).\n*   First, we find the total available kinetic energy `Q_2`:\n    `Q_2 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - m_M)c^2`.\n*   Since M is massless (`m_M = 0`):\n    `Q_2 = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2`.\n*   The endpoint is `Q' = (K_{2E})_max = Q_2`. So, `Q' = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2`.\n\n### 5. Compare the Endpoints\n\n*   Now we compare the new endpoint `Q'` with the original endpoint `Q`:\n    *   `Q' = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2`\n    *   `Q  = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c^2 - (2m_V)c^2`\n*   We can see the relationship: `Q' = Q + 2m_V c^2`.\n*   The particle V is described as \"much lighter,\" implying it has a non-zero rest mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, the term `2m_V c^2` is positive.\n*   This means `Q' > Q`. The endpoint of the spectrum **increases**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The spectrum **remains continuous with an adjusted shape** because there are still three \"bodies\" (the 2E system, the M particle, and the recoiling 2B system) sharing the decay energy.\n2.  The endpoint **increases** because in the variant decay, no energy is required to create the rest mass of the final neutral particles (since M is massless), whereas in the original decay, energy (`2m_V c^2`) was used to create the mass of the two V particles. This \"saved\" energy is now available as kinetic energy, raising the maximum possible energy for the E particles.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
