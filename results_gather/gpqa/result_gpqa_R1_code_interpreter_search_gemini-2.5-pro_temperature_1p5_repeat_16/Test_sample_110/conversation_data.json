    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reactants**: This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone. The base will deprotonate an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor**: Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate**:\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base `t-BuOK` must abstract the only available α-proton from C6 to form the enolate. The negative charge of the enolate resides primarily on the C6 carbon, making it the nucleophilic site.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael addition**:\n    *   The enolate (nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). The electrons from the C=C double bond shift, and the resulting carbanion is subsequently protonated during workup to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A**:\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   The resulting molecule has the following structure: The original cyclohexanone ring is now substituted at C6 with both a methyl group and a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group. The substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) remain unchanged.\n    *   To name this product according to the format in the options, the propanoate chain is treated as the parent chain. This means the cyclohexyl part is named as a substituent.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules for naming substituents, the carbon of the substituent that is attached to the parent chain is numbered as C1. In our product, the attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Let's re-number the ring for naming purposes:\n        *   Old C6 becomes new C1 (this carbon has a methyl group and is attached to the propanoate chain).\n        *   Old C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes new C2 (this carbon has the oxo group).\n        *   Old C2 becomes new C3 (this carbon has an ethyl group and a methyl group).\n    *   The name of the cyclohexyl substituent is therefore **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reactants**: This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor**: 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). Protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   **Michael acceptor**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n    *   **Base**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH), which is strong enough to deprotonate the 1-nitropropane.\n\n2.  **Formation of the nitronate anion**:\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion. The carbon atom (C1) is the nucleophilic site.\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂CH=NO₂]⁻ K⁺ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael addition**:\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. In `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, the β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. The resulting anion is protonated by water.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B**:\n    *   The resulting product has the structure: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The nitrile carbon is C1. The longest chain has 6 carbons. Therefore, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile group:\n        *   C1: -CN\n        *   C2: -CH₂-\n        *   C3: -CH(CH₃)- (A methyl substituent is on C3)\n        *   C4: -CH(NO₂)- (A nitro substituent is on C4)\n        *   C5: -CH₂-\n        *   C6: -CH₃\n    *   The IUPAC name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A**: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B**: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n*   A) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   B) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is correct, B is correct.\n*   D) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
