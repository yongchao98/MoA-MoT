    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent structure is benzene.\n    *   It has three substituents:\n        1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        3.  A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All substituents are *meta* to each other. This is a key feature.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    In electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n    *   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing. In acidic conditions, it becomes **-NH3+** which is strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **-NHCOCH3 (acetamido):** Activating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Direct Synthesis Routes:**\n    Can we make this directly?\n    *   **Path A:** Start with acetylation (Friedel-Crafts).\n        *   Benzene → Acetophenone (-COCH3 is *m*-director).\n        *   Brominate → 3-Bromoacetophenone (-COCH3 directs Br to *meta* position).\n        *   Nitrate → In 3-bromoacetophenone, -COCH3 directs to position 5 (*meta*), and -Br directs to position 5 (*para*). The directors cooperate. This should yield the target product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Path B:** Start with nitration.\n        *   Benzene → Nitrobenzene (-NO2 is *m*-director).\n        *   Brominate → 3-Bromonitrobenzene (-NO2 directs Br to *meta* position).\n        *   Acetylate (Friedel-Crafts) → This reaction **fails**. The ring is too strongly deactivated by both the -NO2 and -Br groups for Friedel-Crafts acylation to occur.\n\n    The existence of a plausible direct route (Path A) is notable, but none of the options consist of just these three steps. The options are all much longer (7 steps) and involve reactions like reduction of a nitro group (`Fe/HCl`) and deamination (`NaNO2/HCl`, then `H3PO2`), which strongly suggest the use of an amino group as a temporary directing group that is later removed. This is a classic strategy to achieve substitution patterns that are difficult to get directly, like the 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Provided:**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n        *   Steps i, ii, and iii constitute the direct synthesis path (Path A from step 3), which produces the target molecule.\n        *   However, the sequence continues with steps iv-vii, which would then modify the target molecule. For example, step iv (`Fe/HCl`) would reduce the nitro group to an amino group. This makes the entire sequence illogical as a synthesis *for* the target. The target is an intermediate, not the final product. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n        *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product).\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This step will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n        *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n        *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n        *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n        *   This sequence of four steps just converts benzene back into benzene. It is a pointless loop. So, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n        Let's analyze this step-by-step, assuming it's the correct, albeit complex, pathway.\n        *   **i) Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene.**\n        *   **ii) Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline.** This creates the key directing group.\n        *   **iii) Aniline --(CH3COCl/AlCl3)--> ?** This is a problematic step as written. Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline is not effective. However, to make the rest of the synthesis work, we must introduce the acetyl group. A Fries rearrangement of N-phenylacetamide (formed in situ) can produce *p*-aminoacetophenone. Let's assume this step yields **p-aminoacetophenone** (-COCH3 at C1, -NH2 at C4).\n        *   **iv) *p*-Aminoacetophenone --(Br2/FeBr3)--> Bromination.** The powerful activating -NH2 group (o,p-director) and the deactivating -COCH3 group (m-director) both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to positions 3 and 5. The reaction is directed to position 3. Product: **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n        *   **v) 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitration.** In the strong acid, the amino group is protonated to the ammonium group (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n            *   We have: -COCH3 (at C1, *m*-director), -Br (at C3, *o,p*-director), and -NH3+ (at C4, *m*-director).\n            *   Let's check where they direct the incoming -NO2:\n                *   -COCH3 directs to C5.\n                *   -Br directs to C5 (*para*) and C2 (*ortho*).\n                *   -NH3+ directs to C2 and C6 (*meta*).\n            *   Position C5 is favored by two directors (-COCH3 and -Br). Position C2 is favored by two directors (-Br and -NH3+). However, C5 is para to the bromo group and meta to two strongly deactivating groups, making it a plausible site for substitution. Let's assume nitration occurs at C5.\n            *   Product: **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n        *   **vi) 1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazotization.** The primary amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n        *   **vii) Diazonium salt --(H3PO2)--> Deamination.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. This removes the guiding amino group.\n        *   **Final Product:** **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n\n    This detailed analysis shows that sequence B, despite a mechanistically ambiguous step (iii), represents a coherent and powerful synthetic strategy that leads to the desired 1,3,5-trisubstituted product. The other options contain clear and insurmountable chemical errors. Therefore, B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
