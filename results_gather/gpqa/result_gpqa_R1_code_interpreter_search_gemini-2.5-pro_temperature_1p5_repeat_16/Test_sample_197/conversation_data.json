    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Chemical Species:** In a solution containing Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN-), a series of complexes will form. The relevant species are:\n    *   Free cobalt ion: `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n3.  **Define Total Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants:** The formation of each complex is governed by its overall stability constant (βn):\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n5.  **Formulate the Fraction of a Species:** We can express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` by substituting the expressions from step 4:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    The fraction of any specific complex, like `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `Fraction of [Co(SCN)2] = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n    `Fraction = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    `Fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Make a Reasonable Approximation:** The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M` is significantly smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`. This means that only a small portion of the thiocyanate will be used to form complexes. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of free thiocyanate ions `[SCN-]` as being equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Value:** Now, we plug the given values into the fraction formula.\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the denominator (often denoted as S or α_M):\n    `Denominator = 1 + β1(0.1) + β2(0.1)^2 + β3(0.1)^3 + β4(0.1)^4`\n    `Denominator = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.01) + 63(0.001) + 16(0.0001)`\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `Denominator = 2.3646`\n\n    Now calculate the numerator for the `[Co(SCN)2]` species:\n    `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Calculate the fraction:\n    `Fraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n    `Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches option C. To verify the calculation, the following Python code is executed.\n```python\n# Define the given constants and concentrations\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The percentage of a specific complex [MLn] is given by:\n# % [MLn] = ( (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i)) ) * 100\n# We are looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)2], where n=2.\n\n# Calculate the individual terms for the denominator sum\nterm0 = 1  # For free Co^2+\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc ** 1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc ** 2)  # This is also the numerator\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc ** 4)\n\n# Calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms)\ndenominator_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]\nfraction_CoSCN2 = term2 / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_CoSCN2 = fraction_CoSCN2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_CoSCN2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482278\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify all Cobalt Species**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions will react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The species present are:\n*   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the Total Cobalt Concentration**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Express Species Concentrations using Stability Constants (β)**\nThe concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**4. Formulate the Fraction of a Species (α)**\nThe fraction of any specific complex, `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. For the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the fraction `α₂` is:\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term is common in all terms and can be canceled out:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Plug in the Values and Calculate**\nWe are given:\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` (We can assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration because the total cobalt concentration, 0.01 M, is much smaller, meaning only a small fraction of the thiocyanate is consumed).\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator:\n\n*   **Numerator:** `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution `16.916180326482287`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
