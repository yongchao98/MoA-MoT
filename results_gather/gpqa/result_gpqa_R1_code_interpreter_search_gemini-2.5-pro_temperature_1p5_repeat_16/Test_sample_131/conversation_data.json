    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given 1H NMR data:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for all compounds. A quick check confirms this for all four options.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(ring) + 4 x CH3 = C10H14.\n        *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(ring) + 2 x C2H5 = C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second aromatic signal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this implies that the number of aromatic protons per molecule for each of the two compounds is the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) protons. The fact that they are all singlets means there is no adjacent proton to cause splitting (i.e., no H on an adjacent carbon). This is true for methyl groups on a benzene ring, but not for ethyl groups.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound:**\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   All four methyl groups are also equivalent. They will produce **one aliphatic singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   There is a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5. The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H), and the methyl at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H). This gives **three aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is 2:1:1.\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6. The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 2H.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (second signal, 6H). This gives **two aliphatic singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   The four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one aromatic singlet** integrating to 4H.\n        *   The ethyl groups give a quartet (for the 4H of the CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the CH3 groups). These are not singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options against the experimental data:**\n\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** The data shows two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   A mixture of any compound with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H singlet) and a tetramethylbenzene (2H singlet) would give a 4H:2H or 2:1 integration ratio, not 1:1. This immediately **eliminates option C**.\n        *   A mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzenes (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) would work for the aromatic region, as each gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would result in two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The data shows three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. We need to check the combinations from the remaining options (A, B, D).\n\n        *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n            *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n            *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H and 6H).\n            *   Total: Three singlets.\n            *   Integration: 12H : 6H : 6H.\n            *   Ratio: **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n        *   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n            *   Durene contributes: one singlet (12H).\n            *   Isodurene contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n            *   Total: Four singlets. This contradicts the \"three signals\" observation. The integration ratio would be 12:6:3:3 or 4:2:1:1, which is also incorrect.\n\n        *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n            *   Prehnitene contributes: two singlets (6H and 6H).\n            *   Isodurene contributes: three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n            *   Total: Up to five signals. Even with accidental overlap of the 6H signals, we would have four signals (one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H signals), which gives an incorrect number of signals and an incorrect ratio (12:6:3:3 or 4:2:1:1).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only combination that produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
