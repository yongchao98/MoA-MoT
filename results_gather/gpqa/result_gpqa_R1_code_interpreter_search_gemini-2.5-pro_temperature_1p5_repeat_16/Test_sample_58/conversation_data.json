    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n    *   **CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n    *   **HCl (a strong acid):**\n        *   HCl dissociates completely in water: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻.\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol HCl\n        *   Since dissociation is 1:1, moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol.\n\n    *   **Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n        *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely in water: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂\n        *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify the total moles of acid and base.**\n    *   Total moles of acid = moles H⁺ (from HCl) + moles CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol of acidic protons.\n    *   Total moles of base = moles OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.180 mol.\n\n3.  **Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: Strong acid + Strong base**\n        *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n        *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n        *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n        *   The strong acid (H⁺) is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be neutralized.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: Weak acid + Remaining Strong base**\n        *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n        *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n        *   The weak acid (CH₃COOH) is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH will be neutralized.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining (in excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n        *   This reaction also produces 0.050 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n4.  **Determine the composition of the final solution and calculate the pH.**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 mol of excess OH⁻ (a strong base) and 0.050 mol of CH₃COO⁻ (a weak base).\n    *   The pH of the solution is primarily determined by the concentration of the excess strong base, as its contribution to the OH⁻ concentration is much more significant than that of the weak base.\n    *   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate the pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate the pH:**\n        *   pH + pOH = 14\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n<<<D>>>"
