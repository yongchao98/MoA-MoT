    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone. Its structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃. The molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The C3 carbon is prochiral, meaning it becomes a new stereocenter upon reduction. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) can occur from two different faces of the carbonyl plane.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5 and a new one is created at C3, the products will be a pair of diastereomers. The original (S) configuration at C5 is unchanged, while the new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct compounds (diastereomers) are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. Its structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent for ketones, and \"excess\" implies that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products:** The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Since the starting material and reagents are all achiral, the chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture. Therefore, the reaction produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains the products from both reactions. In total, there are 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It can separate compounds with different physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers. (The products of Reaction I, C₇H₁₆O₂, are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, C₅H₁₂O₂).\n    *   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers (Compound 1 and 2). They are separable. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair (Compound 3 and 4) and a meso compound (Compound 5).\n        *   The enantiomers (3 and 4) will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound (5) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will be separated, giving its own **separate peak**.\n        *   This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   Since the products of Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, their respective peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral environment. Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Essentially, it can separate all different molecules, including all stereoisomers.\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve them all.\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n        *   meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Assuming ideal separation, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
