    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Structure from the Given Information**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this part is C₆H₄.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This is a crucial piece of information. It means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, one of the substituents is simply a halogen, -X.\n\n**2. Combine the Structural Pieces**\n\n*   We know one substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain any carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must account for both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   The most common and logical chemical group that fits the description of having 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an **acetyl group**: -C(=O)CH₃.\n\n**3. Propose the Final Structure**\n\n*   Combining all the pieces, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. The number of protons is 4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of **7 protons**.\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum and Compare with Options**\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible isomers (*ortho*, *meta*, *para*) and predict their general 1H NMR patterns.\n\n*   **Key signals to look for**:\n    *   A singlet for the 3 protons of the methyl group (-CH₃), deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl. This signal should appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   Signals for the 4 protons on the aromatic ring, in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The splitting pattern will depend on the substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. It lacks the characteristic 3H singlet for an acetyl group's methyl protons. Instead, it has a 2H singlet at 1.3 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is a definitive sign of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not an acetyl group. Although this structure could have 8 carbons (e.g., p-(halomethyl)benzaldehyde, CH₂(X)-C₆H₄-CHO), the halogen would be on the methyl group, not the aromatic ring. This contradicts the \"aromatic-halogen bond\" information from the FTIR.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Proton count**: 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. This matches our expected total number of protons.\n    *   **Methyl signal**: There is a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic signals**: There are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This clean pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion for C**: This data perfectly describes *para*-haloacetophenone. All conditions are met: 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and the correct NMR signals and splitting pattern.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct data for an aromatic compound.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the compound being *para*-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data provided in option C is a classic textbook example of such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
