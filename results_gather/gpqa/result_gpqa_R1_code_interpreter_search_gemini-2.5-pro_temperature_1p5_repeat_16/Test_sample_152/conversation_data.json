    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate. The resulting carbanion (enolate) is stabilized by resonance with the two adjacent ester carbonyl groups, making it an excellent nucleophile for the Michael addition.\n        *   CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt  ⇌  Na⁺[⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + EtOH\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the ester carbonyl group. The *p*-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n        *   Structure: p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, which is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final neutral product.\n\n    [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂] + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃\n    (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH  →  (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n3.  **Identify Product (A):**\n    *   The product is **(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃**.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted propane chain. Let's use the name provided in the options for verification. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" describes the following structure:\n        *   A three-carbon propane chain (C1-C2-C3).\n        *   Two methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n        *   A *p*-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) group on C3.\n        *   This corresponds to the structure we derived: (MeOOC)₂C¹H-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂-COOMe.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogous to enolates and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the α-carbon of the parent ketone).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. This forms a C-C bond between the α-carbon of the original ketone and the β-carbon of the nitrile, generating an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine is removed and protonated.\n\n3.  **Identify Product (B):**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   So, the product is 2-(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's name this compound according to IUPAC rules. The nitrile group (CN) has higher priority than the ketone group (C=O). Thus, the parent chain is the butanenitrile.\n        *   The butanenitrile chain is NC¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃.\n        *   The substituent is on C3, and it is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n    *   This confirms that product B matches the description in options A and B. The alternative name in C and D, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, describes the enol form, which is not the major product after acidic workup.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (Methyl Vinyl Ketone, MVK). Structure: CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   **Conditions:** KOH, H₂O. KOH is the base to generate the nucleophile.\n    *   **Unknown:** Reactant C, the Michael Donor.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Let's identify this bond in the product. The product is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `2-(3-oxobutyl)` substituent. The substituent is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃`. This chain came from MVK (`CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`). The C-C bond formed is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK (the terminal CH₂).\n    *   To find reactant C, we break this bond. Breaking the bond between the ring and the side chain gives us the two starting components (in their reactive, ionic forms): the enolate of reactant C and the electrophilic form of MVK.\n    *   The nucleophile is the enolate of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` where C2 is deprotonated. The hydrogens on C2 are particularly acidic because the negative charge is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n3.  **Verify with a formula check:**\n    *   Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C₁₀H₁₄O₃)\n    *   Reactant (MVK): but-3-en-2-one (C₄H₆O)\n    *   Reactant (C) + C₄H₆O → C₁₀H₁₄O₃\n    *   By subtraction, reactant C must have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O₃ - C₄H₆O = C₆H₈O₂.\n    *   Let's check the formula for the options for C:\n        *   `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`: C₆H₈O₂. This matches.\n        *   `2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione`: C₆H₈O₃. This does not match.\n\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
