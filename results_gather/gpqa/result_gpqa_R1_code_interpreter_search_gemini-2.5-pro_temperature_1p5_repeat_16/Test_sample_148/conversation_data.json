    "*   **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton (the alpha-proton) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   The fact that spin-spin coupling is ruled out means the splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n    *   The two peaks have roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton, suggesting the two different species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   This is a classic sign of having a mixture of isomers.\n\n*   **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   LC (Liquid Chromatography) separates compounds based on their physical properties. The presence of two peaks indicates there are two separable species in the sample.\n    *   MS (Mass Spectrometry) determines the mass of the compounds. The fact that both peaks have the *same* mass spectrum, and that this mass corresponds to the expected product, confirms that the two species are isomers of the target molecule (i.e., they have the same chemical formula but different structures).\n    *   The \"elevated temperature\" condition reinforces that these are stable, distinct species that do not interconvert rapidly on the chromatography time scale.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** They will have distinct NMR spectra. It is expected that the alpha-proton in two different diastereomers would have a different chemical shift. This matches the observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column, resulting in two peaks. Because they have the same chemical formula, they will have the identical mass spectrum. This also perfectly matches the observation. A common way for diastereomers to form in peptide synthesis is if one of the chiral amino acid starting materials racemizes during the synthesis, leading to, for example, a mixture of L-L and D-L peptides. Another common source in peptides is the presence of cis-trans isomers around a peptide bond (these are conformational diastereomers, or rotamers). Both possibilities fall under the umbrella of \"diastereoisomers\".\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would create a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product. The MS data contradicts this.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule, almost certainly with a different mass. The MS data contradicts this.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR environment, enantiomers are indistinguishable and have identical spectra. You would see only one peak for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are not separated and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, this option contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species with identical mass but different NMR signals and different retention times on an LC column is the definitive signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
