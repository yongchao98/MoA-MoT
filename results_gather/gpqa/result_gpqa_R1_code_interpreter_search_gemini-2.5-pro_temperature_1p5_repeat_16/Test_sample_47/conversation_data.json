    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a C=O group. It has four α-hydrogens at the two equivalent α-carbons (CH₂ groups).\n*   **Product 1:** One of the α-hydrogens is substituted by a bromine atom. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone, a strong base (NaOH), and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reactants and conditions points towards two major possibilities for an α-halo ketone: E2 elimination or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Possibility A (Elimination):** The base removes a proton from the other α-carbon, leading to an elimination of HBr and the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, **cyclohex-2-enone**.\n    *   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement):** The base removes a proton from the α-carbon without the bromine. The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide, leading to ring-opening and contraction. The final product after acidic workup (implied) is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n*   **Choosing the pathway:** While elimination is possible, the Favorskii rearrangement is a classic and very common reaction for α-halocyclohexanones. Furthermore, the subsequent reaction steps are more standard and lead to one of the given options if we follow the Favorskii pathway. Let's proceed with this assumption.\n*   **Product 2:** **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms?**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n    ```\n        CHO\n        |\n       / \\\n      H---C1\n         / \\\n      H2C---CH2\n       |   |\n      H2C---CH2\n    ```\n\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** The molecular formula is C₅H₉CHO. Let's count the protons: 1 in the aldehyde group + 1 on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) + 8 on the remaining four carbons of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 1 + 1 + 8 = 10.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum), we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    1.  **Chirality:** The carbon atom C1 is attached to four different groups: (1) a hydrogen atom, (2) the aldehyde group (-CHO), (3) the -CH₂- group of C2, and (4) the -CH₂- group of C5. The paths around the ring from C1 are different (C1-C2-C3... vs C1-C5-C4...), so C1 is a **chiral center**.\n    2.  **Asymmetry:** A molecule with a single chiral center and no other stereocenters lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is an asymmetric molecule belonging to the C₁ point group.\n    3.  **Chemical Equivalence:** In an asymmetric molecule (C₁ point group), no two atoms are equivalent by any symmetry operation. Therefore, every hydrogen atom is in a unique chemical environment.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    *   The aldehyde proton is unique. (1 signal)\n    *   The proton on the chiral carbon (C1) is unique. (1 signal)\n    *   The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center, making them chemically distinct from each other. (2 signals)\n    *   The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic and distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic and distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   The two protons on C5 are diastereotopic and distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   Furthermore, because the entire molecule is asymmetric, the environment of C2 is different from C3, C4, and C5. The same applies to all other positions.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All 10 hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde are chemically distinct. This would give rise to 10 separate signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
