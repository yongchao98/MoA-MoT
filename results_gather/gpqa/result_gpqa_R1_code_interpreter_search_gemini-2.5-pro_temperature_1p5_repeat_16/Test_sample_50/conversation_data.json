    "This problem can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup**: We have a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). Since the sphere is a \"conductor,\" charges are free to move. Since it is \"grounded,\" its electric potential is held at zero (`V=0`). The presence of the external charge `q` will cause the charges within the conductor to redistribute themselves on the surface to maintain the `V=0` condition.\n\n2.  **Method of Image Charges**: To find the electric field and potential outside the sphere, we can replace the sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this new image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero at all points where the sphere's surface used to be (i.e., at a distance `R` from the center).\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position**: For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance from the center `d'` are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Position of image charge (from the center): `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   Note that since `d > R`, it follows that `d' < R`, so the image charge is located inside the original volume of the sphere.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\n    There are two main ways to calculate this energy.\n\n    **Method A: Integration of Force**\n    The force on the real charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `d - d'`.\n    *   Force `F = k * q * q' / (d - d')^2`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n        `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n        `F = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2`\n        `F = - (k * q^2 * R / d) * (d^2 / (d^2 - R^2)^2)`\n        `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The negative sign indicates the force is attractive.\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity.\n        `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n        `U = - ∫[∞ to d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n        `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞ to d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, use a substitution: `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n        `∫ (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n    *   Now, apply the limits of integration:\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method B: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n    The potential energy of interaction can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of `1/2` is crucial because the induced charges are themselves established by the presence of `q`.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, calculate the potential energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Both methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options**: This result corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
