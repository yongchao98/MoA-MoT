    "*   **Step 1: Calculate the initial conditions after dilution.**\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH): `n = C * V = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles`.\n    *   The total volume after adding water is `20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.040 L`.\n    *   The new concentration of acetic acid (`Ca`) before titration is `Ca = n / V_total = 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n    *   At this point, we are in the buffer region, where both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A-), are present.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is `pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`.\n    *   First, calculate the pKa: `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.733`.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   The ratio `[A-]/[HA]` is therefore `0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3`.\n    *   `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256`.\n    *   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n    *   `moles of NaOH added = initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 moles`.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence (`V_eq`): `V_eq = moles / C_NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3`.\n    *   Total volume at the equivalence point: `V_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_eq = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L`.\n    *   At this point, we have 0.001 moles of the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), in 0.050 L of solution.\n    *   The concentration of acetate (`[A-]`) is `0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`.\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water: `CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-`.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, `Kb = Kw / Ka`. `Kw` is the ion product of water, `1.0 x 10^-14`.\n    *   `Kb = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10`.\n    *   Now, we set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: `Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]`.\n    *   Let `x = [OH-] = [CH3COOH]`. Then `Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x)`.\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02`.\n    *   `5.405 x 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.02`.\n    *   `x^2 = (5.405 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10^-11`.\n    *   `x = [OH-] = sqrt(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M`.\n    *   `pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483`.\n    *   `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517`.\n    *   So, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and initial values\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 0.020  # L\nV_water = 0.020 # L\nC_NaOH = 0.1 # M\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculations for pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculations for pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Moles of acid initially present\nmoles_acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial\n\n# Volume of diluted acid solution\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\n\n# Volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point\nV_eq_NaOH = moles_acid / C_NaOH\n\n# Total volume at the equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_eq_NaOH\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nC_base_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration from the hydrolysis of the base\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / C_base  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C_base)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * C_base_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
