    "**1. Understanding the Relationship between Number of Stars and Parallax**\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. In astronomical contexts, this typically refers to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(≥plx)`.\n\nSo, the given relationship is:\n`N(≥plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\nwhere `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n\n**2. Relating Parallax to Distance**\n\nParallax is the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star against the background of distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance, `r`. The standard formula is:\n\n`plx = 1/r`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax in arcseconds.\n\nA larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance. Therefore, the condition of having a parallax greater than or equal to `plx` (`p ≥ plx`) is equivalent to having a distance less than or equal to `r` (`d ≤ r`), where `r = 1/plx`.\n\n**3. Expressing the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance**\n\nWe can now rephrase the given information in terms of distance. `N(≤r)`, the number of stars within a distance `r` from the observer, is proportional to:\n\n`N(≤r) = N(≥plx)` where `plx = 1/r`.\n\nSubstitute `plx = 1/r` into the original proportionality:\n\n`N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n`N(≤r) ∝ 1 / (r⁻⁵)`\n`N(≤r) ∝ r⁵`\n\nThis means the total (cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n**4. Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Distance**\n\nThe question asks \"How does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance. Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N(r)` with respect to `r`, which is `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n\nWe have the proportionality `N(r) ∝ r⁵`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n\n`N(r) = k * r⁵`\n\nNow, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n`dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\nFrom this result, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r⁴`:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the fourth power of the distance. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) ~ r²\nB) ~ r⁴\nC) ~ r⁵\nD) ~ r³\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
