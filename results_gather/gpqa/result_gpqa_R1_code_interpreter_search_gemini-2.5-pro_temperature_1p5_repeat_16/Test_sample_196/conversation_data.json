    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum to Identify Functional Groups**\n    *   A very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this signal to be extremely broad.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** falls squarely in the region for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid, often conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretches within an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group and an aromatic ring is strongly indicated.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum to Determine the Structure**\n    Let's break down the NMR signals:\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) at such a high chemical shift is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   So far, the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid: **R-C₆H₄-COOH**. Now we need to determine the structure of the alkyl group, R.\n\n*   **Step 3: Elucidate the Alkyl Substituent (R) from the Remaining NMR Signals**\n    *   Let's analyze the alkyl region signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us a **-CH₂-CH₃** fragment (an ethyl group).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This gives us a **-CH-CH₃** fragment.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a single proton, and its chemical shift suggests it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). It's a multiplet (m), meaning it's coupled to several other protons. This is our -CH- from the previous point.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is the -CH₂- group from our ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to the -CH₃ (at 0.9 ppm) and the -CH- (at 2.9 ppm).\n    *   **Putting it all together:**\n        1.  Start with the benzylic methine (-CH-) attached to the ring.\n        2.  Attach the methyl group from the `1.4 ppm` signal to this methine: **Ring-CH(CH₃)-**\n        3.  Attach the ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to the same methine: **Ring-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)**\n    *   This combined group is a **sec-butyl group**. Let's verify the splitting:\n        *   **Ring-C*H*(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃):** This proton (at 2.9 ppm) is split by 3 protons from the methyl and 2 from the methylene, resulting in a multiplet. This matches.\n        *   **Ring-CH(C*H*₃)(CH₂CH₃):** This methyl (at 1.4 ppm) is split by the single methine proton, resulting in a doublet. This matches.\n        *   **Ring-CH(CH₃)(C*H*₂CH₃):** These methylene protons (at 1.7 ppm) are split by the methine proton and the terminal methyl protons, resulting in a multiplet. This matches.\n        *   **Ring-CH(CH₃)(CH₂C*H*₃):** This terminal methyl (at 0.9 ppm) is split by the two methylene protons, resulting in a triplet. This matches.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n    Based on the analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the Product of the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is performed with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule (the aromatic ring and the alkyl group) is unaffected by these reagents.\n    *   **Reaction:**\n        4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid  +  (Red P / HI)  →  1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene + other byproducts\n    *   The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reduced at the carboxylic acid position. The -COOH group becomes a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group remains at the para position.\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 6: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This matches our derived product.\n    *   B) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material.\n    *   C) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
