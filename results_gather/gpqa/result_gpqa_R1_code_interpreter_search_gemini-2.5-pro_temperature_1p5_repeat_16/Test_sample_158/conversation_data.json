    "*   **Identify the physical phenomenon:** The user describes a peak in a quasar's spectrum at 790 nm, with a sharp drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line. The drop-off, known as the Gunn-Peterson trough, is caused by the absorption of photons by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Lyα line. Therefore, we can assume the peak at 790 nm is the observed wavelength (λ_obs) of the Lyman-alpha line.\n\n*   **Determine the rest wavelength:** The rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of the hydrogen Lyman-alpha line is approximately 121.6 nm.\n\n*   **Calculate the redshift (z):** The cosmological redshift relates the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength by the formula:\n    1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n    1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm\n    z = (790 / 121.6) - 1\n    z ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497\n\n*   **Calculate the comoving distance:** The user provides the parameters for a flat Lambda-CDM cosmological model (H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7).

    "My reasoning process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Observation:** The user describes a spectral peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths for a distant quasar. This feature is the characteristic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The flux drop at shorter wavelengths is known as the Gunn-Peterson trough, caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** The question describes a peak in the spectrum of a quasar at a wavelength of 790 nm, followed by a sharp decrease in flux at shorter wavelengths. This spectral feature is a hallmark of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The peak corresponds to the Lyα line, which has been stretched to a longer (redder) wavelength by the expansion of the universe. The flux drop at shorter wavelengths, known as the Gunn-Peterson trough, is caused by the absorption of photons by neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):** The cosmological redshift `z` is determined by the ratio of the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) to the wavelength emitted at the source in its rest frame (`λ_rest`).\n    *   The observed wavelength is given: `λ_obs = 790 nm`.\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen is a known physical constant: `λ_rest ≈ 121.6 nm`.\n    *   The formula for redshift is: `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Comoving Distance Formula:** The question asks for the comoving distance (`D_C`) in a flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) universe. The comoving distance is the proper distance between two objects at a constant cosmological time (in this case, today, with scale factor a=1). It accounts for the expansion of the universe. For a flat universe, the formula is:\n\n    `D_C = (c / H₀) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m * (1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `H₀` is the current Hubble constant = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹.\n    *   `Ω_m` is the current matter density parameter = 0.3.\n    *   `Ω_Λ` is the current dark energy density parameter = 0.7.\n    *   `z` is the redshift we just calculated.\n\n4.  **Perform Numerical Calculation:** This integral does not have a simple closed-form solution and needs to be calculated numerically.
