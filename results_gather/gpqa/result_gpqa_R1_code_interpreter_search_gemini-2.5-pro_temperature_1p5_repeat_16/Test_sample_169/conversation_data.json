    "An electron's spin state can be represented by a two-component vector (a spinor). In this case, the unnormalized spin state is given by the column vector:\n$|χ\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket:\n$\\langle χ| = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe spin operator along the y-direction, $S_y$, is defined in terms of the Pauli Y-matrix, $\\sigma_y$:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n\nGiven:\n$\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSo, the $S_y$ operator is:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe expectation value of an operator $A$ for a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n$\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle \\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle \\psi|\\psi\\rangle}$\n\nHere, $A = S_y$ and the state is $|χ\\rangle$. We need to compute the numerator $\\langle χ|S_y|χ\\rangle$ and the denominator $\\langle χ|χ\\rangle$.\n\n**1. Calculate the denominator (normalization factor):**\nThe denominator $\\langle χ|χ\\rangle$ is the squared norm of the state vector.\n$\\langle χ|χ\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)$\n$= -9i^2 + 16$\nSince $i^2 = -1$:\n$= -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n\n**2. Calculate the numerator:**\nFirst, we apply the operator $S_y$ to the state vector $|χ\\rangle$:\n$S_y|χ\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we multiply this result by the bra vector $\\langle χ|$:\n$\\langle χ|S_y|χ\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right)$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (12i^2 - 12)$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (12(-1) - 12)$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (-12 - 12)$\n$= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (-24) = -12\\hbar$\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value:**\nNow, we divide the numerator by the denominator:\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle χ|S_y|χ\\rangle}{\\langle χ|χ\\rangle} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is $-12\\hbar/25$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
