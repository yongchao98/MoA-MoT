    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L_1) to that of Star_2 (L_2), i.e., L_1 / L_2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black-body radiator, is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the star's radius, T is its effective surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The wavelength at which a black body's radiation is most intense (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This law relates to the wavelength *emitted* by the star.\n    *   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is different from the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted). For an object moving radially away (receding) with velocity 'v', the wavelength is redshifted according to the formula: λ_obs = λ_emitted * √((1+β)/(1-β)), where β = v/c (c is the speed of light).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n    L_1 = 4πR_1²σT_1⁴\n    L_2 = 4πR_2²σT_2⁴\n    The ratio is:\n    L_1 / L_2 = (4πR_1²σT_1⁴) / (4πR_2²σT_2⁴)\n    L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)² * (T_1/T_2)⁴\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio of Radii (R_1/R_2):**\n    The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    R_1 = 1.5 * R_2\n    So, (R_1/R_2) = 1.5.\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of Temperatures (T_1/T_2):**\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. Its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is v = 700 km/s. This causes a redshift. We must relate its observed wavelength to its emitted wavelength using the Doppler formula.\n        λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * √((1+β)/(1-β)), where β = v/c.\n    *   Since λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2, we can write:\n        λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * √((1+β)/(1-β)).\n    *   Now, we use Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T) to relate this to temperature:\n        b/T_1 = (b/T_2) * √((1+β)/(1-β)).\n    *   Canceling 'b' and rearranging to find T_1/T_2:\n        1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * √((1+β)/(1-β))\n        T_2/T_1 = √((1+β)/(1-β))\n        T_1/T_2 = √((1-β)/(1+β)).\n\n6.  **Substitute Ratios into the Luminosity Formula:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)² * (√((1-β)/(1+β)))⁴\n    L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1-β)/(1+β))²\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    First, calculate β = v/c:\n    v = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n    β = 700,000 / 299,792,458 ≈ 0.0023349\n\n    Now, plug this into the final expression. This calculation is best done with a script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458     # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v_r2 / c\n\n# The ratio of luminosities is given by:\n# L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4\n# We found that T_1/T_2 = sqrt((1-beta)/(1+beta))\n# So, (T_1/T_2)^4 = ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio factor\nT_ratio_factor_powered = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nL_ratio = (R_ratio**2) * T_ratio_factor_powered\n\nprint(f\"{L_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n2.2291\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.2291. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe closest option is B.\n\n(Note: The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.)\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve the problem and provide a final answer.\n\n**My thought process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 (L₁/L₂).\n    *   **Given Information for Star 1:**\n        *   Radius: R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n        *   Mass: M₁ = 1.5 * M₂ (This is likely extraneous information, as luminosity in the black-body model doesn't depend directly on mass).\n        *   Radial Velocity: v₁ = 0 km/s.\n    *   **Given Information for Star 2:**\n        *   Radius: R₂\n        *   Mass: M₂\n        *   Radial Velocity: v₂ = 700 km/s.\n    *   **Connecting Information:**\n        *   The wavelength at which they appear brightest is the same: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n        *   Assumption: The stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Physical Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_emitted) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the object's radial velocity (v).

R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂) = 1.5.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** This is the tricky part. We need to relate the temperatures using the wavelength information.\n        *   We are given λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂.\n        *   **For Star 1:** v₁ = 0. There is no Doppler shift. Therefore, λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁.\n        *   **For Star 2:** v₂ = 700 km/s. This is a significant velocity, so there is a Doppler shift (redshift, as it's moving away, though the sign doesn't matter for the formula if we assume it's just a magnitude of velocity). Let's use the Doppler formula: λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * √((1+β)/(1-β)), where β = v₂/c.\n        *   Now we can equate the observed wavelengths:\n            λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * √((1+β)/(1-β))\n        *   Next, use Wien's Law (λ_emitted = b/T) to substitute for the emitted wavelengths:\n            b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √((1+β)/(1-β))\n        *   Cancel the Wien's constant 'b' and rearrange to find the temperature ratio T₁/T₂:\n            1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * √((1+β)/(1-β))\n            T₂/T₁ = √((1+β)/(1-β))\n            T₁/T₂ = √((1-β)/(1+β))\n\n5.  **Combine Everything into the Final Equation:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (√((1-β)/(1+β)))⁴\n        L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * ((1-β)/(1+β))²\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   First, calculate β = v₂/c.\n        *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n        *   c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n    *   This is a good point to use a Python script to avoid rounding errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458    # speed of light in m/s\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1-beta)/(1+beta))\n# (T1/T2)^4 = ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio}\")\n```\nThe previous execution provided the result `2.2291`.\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   The calculated value is 2.2291.\n    *   The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.23, C) ~2.32, D) ~2.35.\n    *   The value 2.2291 rounds to 2.23.

    "The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star behaving as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\nwhere:\n*   R is the radius of the star.\n*   T is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n*   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Radius Ratio (R₁/R₂):**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, (R₁/R₂) = 1.5.\n\n**3. Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\nThis ratio must be determined from the information about the peak wavelengths.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) at which its radiation is most intense:\n    λ_emitted = b / T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    This can be rearranged to T = b / λ_emitted.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v). The relativistic Doppler effect formula for a receding source is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * √((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)) = λ_emitted * √((1 + β) / (1 - β)), where β = v/c.\n\n*   **Applying the laws to our stars:**\n    We are told that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity v₁ = 0, so there is no Doppler shift.
