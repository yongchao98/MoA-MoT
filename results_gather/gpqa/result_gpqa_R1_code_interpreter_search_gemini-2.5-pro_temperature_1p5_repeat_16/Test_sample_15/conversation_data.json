    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond, but no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A plane containing all the atoms of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The name provides the specific stereochemistry: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. The `R` and `S` designations refer to the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a).\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific stereoisomer (e.g., with R/S labels), it refers to a single enantiomer or a diastereomer. A single enantiomer is always optically active.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters can be achiral only if it is a meso compound, which requires an internal plane of symmetry. Given the complex and asymmetric nature of the molecule (an isobenzofuran-dione core with a methano bridge and a chloromethylene substituent), it does not possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this specific named stereoisomer is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The specified configuration is `(2R,3S)`. Let's examine its structure, for example, using a Fischer projection.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        CH3 - C - H   (This is the 2R center)\n        -----------\n          H - C - CH3   (This is the 3S center)\n              |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The configuration is `(2R,3R)`.\n    *   This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being the (2S,3S) isomer). As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-C6-` part of the ring, and the `-CH=C2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. There are several possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is non-standard for monocyclic systems, but `s` is often used for `syn`, which is equivalent to `cis`. Interpreting this name as the `all-cis` isomer is the most chemically reasonable approach.\n    *   In the all-cis isomer, all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., all axial or all equatorial in the chair conformation).\n    *   This `all-cis` isomer is highly symmetric. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv).\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral**, even though it contains prochiral centers. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers or other elements of chirality.\n    *   None of the carbon atoms are bonded to four different groups. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are `CH2` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl, which is also not a stereocenter as the two paths around the ring from this point are identical.\n    *   The molecule has an accessible conformation with a plane of symmetry (e.g., the plane that contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nIn total, there are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
