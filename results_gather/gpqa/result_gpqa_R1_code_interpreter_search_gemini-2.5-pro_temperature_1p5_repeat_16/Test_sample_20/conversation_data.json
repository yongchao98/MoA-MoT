    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a chemical phenomenon where a compound exists in two or more interconvertible forms that are in equilibrium. The forms, known as tautomers, differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. A key requirement for the common keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen** (a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone, C₆H₄O₂):**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two double bonds (C=C) between carbons 2-3 and 5-6.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the double bonds. While they have hydrogen atoms, attempting to move one of these hydrogens to an oxygen atom (an \"enolization\" process) would result in hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂).\n        *   Critically, the molecular formula changes from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Isomers, including tautomers, must have the same molecular formula. The conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone is a reduction, not a tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃):**\n        *   This structure has three carbonyl groups in a cyclohexane ring. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Due to the presence of these alpha-hydrogens, this compound can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, **phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene, C₆H₆O₃)**.\n        *   Since the molecular formula remains C₆H₆O₃, this is a clear example of tautomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            3.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n        *   The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center.\n        *   Furthermore, the molecule is symmetrical; it has a center of inversion in the middle of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
