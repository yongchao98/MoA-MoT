    "This is a problem of interpreting the structure of a quantum field theory calculation. The key to determining the number of loops in a Feynman diagram from an expression for its amplitude is to look at the factors of `4π` that arise from loop integrals.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Loop Integrals and Factors of 4π:** In quantum field theory, when calculating Feynman diagrams, each closed loop corresponds to an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, let's call it `k`. This is a four-dimensional integral `∫ d⁴k`.\n\n2.  **Dimensional Regularization:** A standard technique to handle the divergences in these integrals is dimensional regularization. In this method, the calculation is performed in `d` spacetime dimensions instead of 4. After performing the integration, one finds that each loop integral contributes a characteristic factor to the amplitude.\n\n3.  **The Loop Factor:** For a calculation in `d` dimensions, each loop integral contributes a factor of `1 / (4π)^(d/2)`. Since the problem states the theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, we set `d=4`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Factor for d=4:**\n    *   For `d=4`, the factor per loop is `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)²`.\n\n5.  **Generalizing for L Loops:** If a Feynman diagram has `L` loops, there will be `L` such independent loop integrals. Therefore, the total factor from all the loops will be `(1 / (4π)²)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the Given Expression:** The scribbled note gives the size estimate as:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n7.  **Identifying the Loop Contribution:** We need to find the part of the expression that corresponds to the `1 / (4π)^(2L)` loop factor. The term `1/(4pi)^6` is clearly this contribution.\n\n8.  **Solving for L:** We can now equate the general form with the specific term from the note:\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)⁶`\n\n    This implies that the exponents must be equal:\n    `2L = 6`\n\n    Solving for `L`, we get:\n    `L = 3`\n\n9.  **Considering Other Factors:**\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants. Their powers relate to the number of interaction vertices in the diagram. This confirms it's a higher-order process.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that could arise from symmetry factors of the diagram, traces over Dirac matrices, or group theory factors.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales (`Q`) and masses (`M`), which is typical in the results of loop calculations.\n\nThese other factors are all consistent with a loop calculation, but the number of loops is most directly and reliably determined by the power of `1/(4π)`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
