    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   The dienophile is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. This describes the conversion of maleic acid to maleic anhydride. The NMR data provided for the anhydride (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are consistent with the symmetric structure of maleic anhydride.\n    *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄. The structure consists of a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (a cyclopentadiene system) and four methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, matches the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is usually the kinetically favored product (the major product under standard conditions) due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, significant steric hindrance can override this electronic preference. In the diene, there are methyl groups at the bridgehead-forming carbons (C1 and C4). For the *endo* transition state, the anhydride moiety of the dienophile must approach from underneath the diene ring, leading to a severe steric clash with these bridgehead methyl groups.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the anhydride moiety points away from the bridgehead methyls, though it gets closer to the vinyl methyl groups (on C2 and C3). This steric interaction is generally considered less severe than the clash with the bridgehead methyls in the *endo* approach.\n    *   Therefore, due to steric hindrance, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n    *   The problem provides four distinct NMR signals and their integrals. Let's assign them to the protons in the product structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride). The product has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the spectrum.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinyl methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-1.8 ppm. There are two such equivalent methyl groups (on C2 and C3 of the original diene). This signal corresponds to the **vinyl methyls**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Methyl groups on a saturated carbon atom typically resonate around 0.9-1.2 ppm. There are two such equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). This signal corresponds to the **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two protons originating from the maleic anhydride. They are now on a saturated carbon framework and are alpha to carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Their equivalence due to symmetry leads to a singlet. This signal corresponds to the **anhydride-derived protons (H_alkane)**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal represents one of the two diastereotopic protons of the methylene bridge (C7). The other proton would be a separate signal. This corresponds to one of the **bridge protons (H_bridge)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å apart).\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that is unique to the major (*exo*) adduct.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **Exo Adduct (Major):** The anhydride part (and its protons, H_alkane) is on the same side of the molecule as the C2=C3 double bond. The H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the **vinyl methyls** (~1.7 ppm). They are far from the methylene bridge protons.\n        *   **Endo Adduct (Minor):** The anhydride part is tucked underneath, on the same side as the methylene bridge. The H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from the vinyl methyls. However, they are close to the **bridge protons** (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   The NOE interaction that is characteristic of the **major (exo) adduct** is the one between the **H_alkane protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons**.\n    *   The NOE interaction that is characteristic of the **minor (endo) adduct** is the one between the **H_alkane protons** and the **bridge protons**.\n    *   Since the observed cross-peak is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product, it must be the correlation unique to the *exo* form.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the H_alkane protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
