    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula be C_n H_m.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\nMass % H = (m × M_H) / (n × M_C + m × M_H)\nWhere M_H ≈ 1 g/mol and M_C ≈ 12 g/mol.\n0.1428 = (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\nLet's test the fraction 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857.\nm / (12n + m) = 1 / 7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\nSo, the general formula for Z is C_n H_{2n}.\n\nThe problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane and is widely used as a solvent. Common examples are cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z. Let's call the other liquid D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, D must also be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means that D, upon hydrogenation, also yields Z.\n*   This implies that D must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which in this context involves dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. This suggests D is a dehydrogenated form of a related cycloalkane, which points towards an aromatic compound.\n\nLet's test possible identities for Z:\n*   **Case n=5:** If Z is cyclopentane (C5H10), D would have to be an aromatic C5 compound that hydrogenates to cyclopentane. There are no stable neutral aromatic C5 hydrocarbons (the cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic, but that's not what we have here). So, n=5 is unlikely.\n*   **Case n=6:** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   This is a mixture of two liquids. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. This case is perfectly consistent.\n*   **Case n=7:** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D must be an aromatic compound with a C7 skeleton that hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. The candidate is **toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane (C7H14), toluene (C7H8)}.\n    *   This case is also perfectly consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction X -> Y and identify the components of mixture X.**\nThe reaction transforms an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} into an equimolar mixture Y = {Z, D}. This happens in a 1:1 molar ratio, so the overall reaction is:\nA + B → Z + D\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction, a type of disproportionation where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nLet's balance the hydrogen atoms for the two plausible cases:\n*   **Case n=6:** A + B → C6H12 + C6H6. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Case n=7:** A + B → C7H14 + C7H8. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nNow let's find A and B for each case.\n*   A and B are liquids in an equimolar mixture X.\n*   They both decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only Z, so they must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n\nLet's analyze the candidates for X:\n*   **Case n=6 (Z = cyclohexane):**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds (not conjugated).\n    *   Possible molecules are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This also fits.\n    *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture X is **{cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}**.\n*   **Case n=7 (Z = methylcyclohexane):**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C7-ring compounds (not conjugated) with a methylcyclohexane skeleton.\n    *   Possible molecules are methylcyclohexene isomers (C7H12) and non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene isomers (C7H10).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: 12 + 10 = 22. This matches our requirement for the C7 case.\n    *   This case is also chemically plausible.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the ambiguity and find the final answer.**\nWe have two plausible scenarios, one leading to a total of 18 hydrogen atoms in X, and another leading to 22. Both 18 (Option A) and 22 (Option B) are available choices. Such problems in a chemistry context, when ambiguous, often rely on the most fundamental or common textbook example. The disproportionation/hydrogen transfer reactions involving the C6 system (cyclohexane/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene/benzene) are canonical examples in organic chemistry. The C7 system, while valid, is a less fundamental example. Therefore, it is most probable that the question refers to the C6 system.\n\nLet's finalize with the C6 system:\n*   Mixture X contains cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
