    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The core of the question is about \"regularization at high energies.\" This is a specific procedure used in physics, primarily in quantum field theory (QFT), to handle mathematical infinities (divergences) that appear in calculations. These infinities typically arise when considering interactions at very short distances, which corresponds to very high energies (also known as ultraviolet or UV divergences).\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory that describes how light and matter interact. When calculating properties like the self-energy of an electron or the strength of its interaction with a photon, physicists use techniques like Feynman diagrams. These calculations involve integrals over all possible energies and momenta of virtual particles. These integrals often diverge at the high-energy end. To solve this, physicists first \"regularize\" the integral (making it finite by introducing a temporary, non-physical parameter like an energy cutoff) and then \"renormalize\" the theory by absorbing the infinities into the definitions of fundamental constants like mass and charge. Therefore, QED absolutely **requires regularization**.\n\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. It is a *classical* theory, not a quantum one. The specific problem of UV divergences from loop integrals in Feynman diagrams does not exist here. However, classical electrodynamics has its own notorious infinity problem: if you treat an electron as a point particle, the energy contained in its own electric field is infinite. This indicates that the classical theory is incomplete and breaks down at very small scales. While one might try to \"regularize\" this by assuming the electron has a tiny, non-zero size, this is an ad-hoc fix. The term \"regularization at high energies\" is most strongly associated with the systematic procedures of QFT. So, while it has its own infinities, it doesn't undergo the same regularization process as QED or QCD. But it's not a complete theory at high energies.\n\n    *   **C) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity and a \"theory of everything.\" A central motivation and celebrated feature of the theory is that it is believed to be \"UV finite.\" Unlike QFTs which model fundamental particles as zero-dimensional points, string theory models them as one-dimensional, vibrating strings. This inherent \"fuzziness\" or finite extension of the strings smooths out interactions at very short distances. As a result, the calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory do not produce the high-energy (UV) divergences found in QFTs. Consequently, superstring theory **is not believed to require regularization**.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, which governs the interactions of quarks and gluons. Like QED, it is a QFT and suffers from the same kind of UV divergences in its calculations. Therefore, QCD also **requires regularization** and renormalization to produce meaningful physical predictions.\n\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   QED and QCD are standard QFTs that both require regularization.\n    *   Classical Electrodynamics has divergence issues, but these are symptoms of the theory's breakdown at high energies, and it doesn't use the standard regularization techniques of QFT.\n    *   Superstring Theory is specifically formulated in a way that is expected to naturally eliminate the high-energy divergences, making regularization unnecessary.\n\n    The question asks which theory *never* requires this procedure. Superstring Theory is the only candidate built on the principle of being UV finite.\n\n<<<C>>>"
