    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') of the biphenyl system. Specifically, there are methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups at positions 2 and 2', and nitro (-NO₂) groups at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky ortho substituents (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) create significant steric hindrance, which restricts the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting twisted, stable conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atoms for a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n        *   The carbon at position 2 (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon (C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. If the phenyl rings are co-planar with the carbonyl group, the molecule has a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane). Even if the rings are twisted out of the plane, a plane of symmetry can still be found that bisects the molecule. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n        *   It is a planar molecule and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). It also has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, show geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, its cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (has a chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
