    "To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, we can use the general formula for interplanar spacing in this system.\n\n### 1. The General Formula\n\nThe formula for the interplanar distance `d` for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) in a rhombohedral crystal system is given by:\n\n```\n1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]\n```\n\nWhere:\n*   `a` is the lattice parameter (interatomic distance).\n*   `α` is the interaxial angle.\n*   `h, k, l` are the Miller indices.\n\n### 2. Given Values\n\nWe are given:\n*   `a = 10` Angstrom\n*   `α = β = γ = 30°`\n*   The plane is `(hkl) = (111)`\n\n### 3. Simplification for the (111) Plane\n\nFor the (111) plane, we have `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`. Let's substitute these into the formula.\n*   `h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3`\n*   `hk + kl + lh = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`\n\nSubstituting these values into the numerator of the formula:\nNumerator = `3sin²α + 2(3)(cos²α - cosα) = 3sin²α + 6cos²α - 6cosα`\nUsing the identity `sin²α + cos²α = 1`, we can rewrite the numerator:\nNumerator = `3(sin²α + cos²α) + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1) + 3cos²α - 6cosα = 3(1 - 2cosα + cos²α)`\nThis is a perfect square:\nNumerator = `3(1 - cosα)²`\n\nNow let's simplify the denominator part `(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`. Let `x = cosα`. The expression is `2x³ - 3x² + 1`. We can see that `x=1` is a root. Factoring the polynomial gives `(x-1)²(2x+1)`, which is `(cosα - 1)²(2cosα + 1)` or `(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nSo the full denominator is `a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)`.\n\nNow, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the `1/d²` equation:\n```\n1/d² = [3(1 - cosα)²] / [a²(1 - cosα)²(1 + 2cosα)]\n```\nAssuming `α ≠ 0`, `cosα ≠ 1`, so the `(1 - cosα)²` terms cancel out:\n```\n1/d² = 3 / [a²(1 + 2cosα)]\n```\nThis is a much simpler formula specific to the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nNow we can plug in the given values into the simplified formula:\n*   `a = 10`\n*   `α = 30°`, so `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`\n\n```\n1/d² = 3 / [10² * (1 + 2 * (√3 / 2))]\n1/d² = 3 / [100 * (1 + √3)]\n```\nNow, we solve for `d`:\n```\nd² = [100 * (1 + √3)] / 3\nd = √([100 * (1 + √3)] / 3)\nd = 10 * √((1 + √3) / 3)\n```\nTo get the numerical value, we will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 10.0\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n\n# Using the simplified formula for the (111) plane\n# d = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)\nd = a * math.sqrt((1 + 2 * cos_alpha) / 3)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n```output\n9.542974635107384\n```\n\nThe calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 8.95 Angstrom\nB) 9.54 Angstrom\nC) 10.05 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value of 9.54 Angstrom matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
