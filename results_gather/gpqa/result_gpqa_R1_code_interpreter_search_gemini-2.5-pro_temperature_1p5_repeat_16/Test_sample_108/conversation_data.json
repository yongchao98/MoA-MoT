    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S=0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic S) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L=0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state (`NN'`) and a particle `X`.\n`1S0 -> NN' + X`\n\nThe final state consists of:\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN'`, denoted by `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n*   The emitted particle `X`, which has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` relative to the `NN'` center of mass. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**A. Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_initial = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_final` must also be 0.\n`J_final` is the vector sum of the `NN'` total angular momentum `J'` and the particle `X`'s total angular momentum `j_X`.\n`j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`. The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, so we can assume it's a pseudoscalar particle (like a pion) with `s_X = 0`.\nThus, `j_X = l_X`.\nThe conservation law is `J_initial = J_final`, so `vec{J_initial} = vec{J'} + vec{l_X}`.\nSince `J_initial = 0`, we have `0 = vec{J'} + vec{l_X}`, which implies `vec{J'} = -vec{l_X}`. For this to hold, their magnitudes must be equal:\n**Rule 1: `J' = l_X`**\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe initial parity is `P_initial = +1`. The final parity `P_final` must also be `+1`.\n`P_final = P(NN') * P(X) * P_orbital`\n*   `P(NN') = (-1)^L'`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n*   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the wavefunction for relative motion)\nSo, `P_final = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\nFor parity to be conserved (`P_final = +1`), the exponent must be even:\n`L' + l_X + 1 = even`\nThis implies:\n**Rule 2: `L' + l_X = odd`**\n\n**C. Generalized Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\nFor any system of two identical fermions like nucleons (when treated in the isospin formalism), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the requirement that the sum of their isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers must be odd:\n`T + S + L = odd`.\n\nThe problem specifies two conditions for the final `NN'` state:\n1.  The Pauli principle holds: `T' + S' + L' = odd`.\n2.  The isospin is `T' = 0`.\n\nSubstituting `T' = 0` into the Pauli rule gives:\n`0 + S' + L' = odd`.\n**Rule 3: `S' + L' = odd`**\n\n**D. Fundamental Constraint on Nucleon Spin:**\nA system of two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can only have a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n**Rule 4: `S'` must be 0 or 1.**\n\nAny permitted reaction must satisfy all these rules. We are looking for the one that is **not permitted**, meaning it violates at least one rule.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's test each option against the four rules derived above.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1` -> `2S'+1=7` means `S'=3`. `L'=D=2`. `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=3`. This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state: `3D3` -> `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X: `f`-wave -> `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=3`, `l_X=3`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 2+3=5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+2=3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state: `3S1` -> `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=1`, `l_X=1`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 0+1=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state: `3P0` -> `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X: `s`-wave -> `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=0`, `l_X=0`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+1=2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S'+L'` must be odd for a `T'=0` state.\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition given the constraint `T'=0`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are not permitted.\n*   **Transition A** is impossible because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) is not a valid two-nucleon state. This is a violation of the fundamental rules of adding angular momentum.\n*   **Transition D** is impossible because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for a `T=0` final state, as `S'+L'=2` is even. This can also be seen as a fundamental contradiction: a `3P0` state must have `T=1` to satisfy `T+S+L=odd` (`T+1+1=odd`), which contradicts the problem's premise that the final state has `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks which partial wave is not permitted. Usually, such questions test the application of selection rules on transitions between valid states. The violation in option D is a direct contradiction of the premises explicitly stated in the problem (`T(NN)=0` and the Pauli statistics rule). The violation in option A is due to the non-existence of the state itself, a fact that is fundamental but not explicitly listed in the rules to \"make use of\". Given that the properties of state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) are in direct conflict with the condition `T=0` via the Pauli principle, this represents the most direct violation of the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, we select D as the answer. It is forbidden by the explicit rules that the problem requires us to use.\n\n<<<D>>>"
