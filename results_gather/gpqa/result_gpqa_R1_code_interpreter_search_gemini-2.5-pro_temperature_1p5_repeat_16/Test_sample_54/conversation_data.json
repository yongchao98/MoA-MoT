    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   **Signal 2:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 3:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 4:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone. In this case, it corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group (CH₃COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetate group. All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the alkene (or vinylic) region (typically 5-7.5 ppm), indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. Its downfield position suggests it's attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond tells us about their relative positions:\n        *   **trans-coupling:** J ≈ 12-18 Hz\n        *   **cis-coupling:** J ≈ 6-12 Hz\n    *   A J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two coupled vinylic protons are **trans** to each other. This immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate (D) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical value for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond, C=C-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the presence of a CH₃-CH= fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets. This complex splitting pattern means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one other proton. This must be the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm), and the coupling constant for this split must be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4). This corresponds to coupling with the adjacent methyl group we identified from the signal at 1.6 ppm.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's piece together the fragments we've identified:\n1.  An acetate group: **-O-CO-CH₃** (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n2.  A trans double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the 7.0 ppm signal's J-value).\n3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: **CH₃-CH=** (from the 1.6 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals).\n\nCombining these pieces gives us the following structure:\n**CH₃ - CH = CH - O - CO - CH₃**\n\nThe stereochemistry is **trans**, as determined by the J = 16.0 Hz coupling constant.\n\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The stereochemistry is cis, and it's a butenyl group, not a propenyl group. A butenyl group would have signals for an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-), which are not observed.\n*   **B) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. While the stereochemistry is trans, this compound has a butenyl group. We would expect signals for an ethyl group, not the observed doublet for a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data: the trans stereochemistry (J=16.0 Hz), the acetate singlet (2.1 ppm), the allylic methyl doublet (1.6 ppm), and the two distinct vinylic protons with their characteristic splitting patterns and chemical shifts (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The stereochemistry is cis (J ≈ 6-12 Hz), which contradicts the observed J = 16.0 Hz.\n\n<<<C>>>"
