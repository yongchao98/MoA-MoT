    "Here is my reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C). However, the clue mentions \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\". This strongly suggests we are dealing with heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O). The melting point of D₂O is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to 277 K.\n        *   **Conclusion:** **B is D₂O (Heavy Water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** The release of water (or heavy water) upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of a hydrate (or in this case, a \"deuterate\"). The substance G must be a metal hydroxide-d, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** Let's assume Substance X is a common reducing agent used in organic chemistry that incorporates a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, D). Prime candidates are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). The \"very close analog\" mentioned in another clue would be LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄, both standard reagents.\n        *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄**. It's known to react violently with protic substances. If it reacts with D₂O (heavy water), the reaction would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n            *   **Liquid Y:** Y would be D₂O. This is consistent.\n            *   **Precipitate G:** The product Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide) is the heavy-water analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B). This fits perfectly.\n            *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (dideuterium). Let's check its neutron and proton count. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the clue that the number of neutrons and protons is the same.\n        *   This hypothesis (X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O, W=D₂, G=Al(OD)₃, B=D₂O) works for all clues so far.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH). Substance X, LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄), is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both the ketone to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OD) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OD). The final product, a diol, has only 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X**\n\n    *   All the evidence points to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value**\n\n    *   **Question:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X...\"\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:** We compare the elements by their atomic mass (or mass number, as the options are integers).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li): Mass number of the common isotope is 7.\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Mass number of the only stable isotope is 27.\n        *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as D).\n        *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al).\n\n    *   **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative mass, summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n        *   **Mass from heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   **Mass from lightest element (H/D):** There are four atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
