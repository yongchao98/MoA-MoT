    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Masses and Energies\n\nFirst, let's determine the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two fragments.\n\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):**\n    The problem states the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):**\n    Let `m1` be the mass of the more massive fragment and `m2` be the mass of the less massive fragment.\n    We are given two relationships:\n    1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n    Substitute the first relation into the second:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n    Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n    We can now find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `E1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `E2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe fission process releases energy, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This released energy, known as the Q-value, comes from the decrease in total rest mass.\n\n*   Initial Energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   Final Rest Energy: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`\n\nBy conservation of energy, the total energy released as kinetic energy (`Q`) is:\n`Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the conservation of momentum to find how the kinetic energy is distributed. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** `p1 = p2`\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p^2 / (2m)` which means `p^2 = 2 * m * T`\n\nUsing `p1^2 = p2^2`:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have:\n`2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n1.  `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n2.  `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nThe correct calculation must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum. Momentum conservation `p1 = p2` still holds.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n*   This can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy `T = E - m*c^2`:\n    `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nUsing `p1^2 = p2^2`, and therefore `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1_rel * (T1_rel + 2*m1*c^2) = T2_rel * (T2_rel + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nWe use the system of equations (with all energies in GeV):\n1.  `T1_rel + T2_rel = 3`  =>  `T2_rel = 3 - T1_rel`\n2.  `m1*c^2 = 198` and `m2*c^2 = 99`\n\nSubstitute into the momentum equation:\n`T1_rel * (T1_rel + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1_rel) * ((3 - T1_rel) + 2 * 99)`\n`T1_rel * (T1_rel + 396) = (3 - T1_rel) * (3 - T1_rel + 198)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396 * T1_rel = (3 - T1_rel) * (201 - T1_rel)`\n`T1_rel^2 + 396 * T1_rel = 603 - 201*T1_rel - 3*T1_rel + T1_rel^2`\n`396 * T1_rel = 603 - 204 * T1_rel`\n`396 * T1_rel + 204 * T1_rel = 603`\n`600 * T1_rel = 603`\n`T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`\n\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
