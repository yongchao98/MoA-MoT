    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to inactivate the gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein.\n\n2.  **Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A single nucleotide change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. This may or may not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of the specific amino acid that was changed.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the nucleotide sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change that results in a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to \"knock out\" a gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame, altering every subsequent codon. This typically leads to a completely different, non-functional protein and often introduces a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective knockout strategy.\n    *   **In-Frame Deletion/Insertion:** A deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This can be disruptive but is less certain to inactivate the protein than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Gene and the Mutants:**\n    Let's analyze the start of the gene by breaking it into codons (triplets). The process starts at `ATG`.\n\n    *   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein Translation: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n\n    Now let's compare each mutant to the intact gene sequence. We'll focus on the changes in the codons and the resulting amino acids.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Change 1: `TTT` -> `TTC`. `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   Change 2: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** A single amino acid is changed in the protein. This might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Change 1: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a **silent mutation** (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   Change 2: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), but `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The ribosome will stop translation after the second amino acid. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe), which is completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change 1: `CTC` -> `TAC`. This is a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr).\n        *   Change 2: `ACT` -> `GTC` (in the 6th codon). This is also a **missense mutation** (Threonine -> Valine).\n        *   **Effect:** Two amino acids are changed in the protein. While more disruptive than one change, it still produces a full-length protein that might retain some function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The sequence shows a change from `CTC GCT GGT` to `TAC GCT`. This indicates both a substitution (`CTC` -> `TAC`, a **missense mutation**) and the **deletion** of the codon `GGT`.\n        *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion of one amino acid (Glycine) plus a missense mutation. This is disruptive, but because the reading frame is maintained, a near-full-length protein is still produced. It is less certain to cause complete inactivation than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic for the gene's function. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the sequence, it ensures that no functional protein can be produced. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
