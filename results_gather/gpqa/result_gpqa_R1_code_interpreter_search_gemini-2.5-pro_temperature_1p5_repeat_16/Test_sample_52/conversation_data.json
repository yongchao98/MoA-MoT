    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, so its formula is C6H4. The `1H NMR` spectrum shows only two signals for aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a 1,4- (or para-) substitution pattern, as this symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent, resulting in two signals.\n\n2.  **Identify the functional groups from the spectra:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3), ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), or propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3) as substituents.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n            *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   The proton H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), so it appears as a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:**\n            *   One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its protons would be split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), appearing as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl group attached directly to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this fragment contributes C2H3O2 to the overall formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester and methyl group fragment (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): C2H3O2\n\n    Now, sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester/methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The calculated molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. Let's briefly check why the other options are incorrect based on the data:\n    *   C11H14O2 and C12H14O2: These formulas have more hydrogen atoms, which implies more saturation. To fit the description, you would likely need to replace the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) with a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) or add a CH2 group elsewhere, both of which are ruled out by the \"no -CH2 groups\" constraint.\n    *   C12H12O2: This would require adding one carbon atom without adding hydrogen atoms relative to our derived structure. This is not possible given the fragments identified from the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the only formula consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
