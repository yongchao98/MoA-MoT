    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one, NaCN, and reagent A.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (⁻CN) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        2.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must provide a proton (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. H₃O⁺, typically from a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water, is a standard source of protons for this step (acid workup). NaHSO₃ is used for forming bisulfite addition products and is not suitable here.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is H₃O⁺. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin, which contains a nitrile group, -C≡N).\n    *   **Reactants for conversion:** Reagent B and water (H₂O).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (contains a carboxylic acid group, -COOH).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water is known as **hydrolysis**.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** This hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The options for B are HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis involves the protonation of the nitrile nitrogen by a strong acid (like HCl), making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. After a series of steps, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. While a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is far less effective and efficient than a strong mineral acid like HCl. The standard and most effective reagent for complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a strong acid.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
