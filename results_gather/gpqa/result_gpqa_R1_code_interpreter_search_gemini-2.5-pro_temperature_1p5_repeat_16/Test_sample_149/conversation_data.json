    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n    1.  **Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n        *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`. For C8H9NO, DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which has a DoU of 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (like a C=C or C=O bond).\n\n        *   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n            *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This indicates a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n            *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This signal corresponds to 2 protons. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (1+1=2). This fits the `-CH2-` part of the `-CH2-CHO` group, where these two protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n            *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (compared to benzene at 7.3 ppm), suggesting the presence of at least one electron-donating group.\n            *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: This is a broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons, which is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The protons can exchange, and nitrogen's quadrupole moment often leads to broad signals.\n\n        *   **Structure Determination:**\n            *   We have three fragments: a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`), an amino group (`-NH2`), and an ethanal group (`-CH2CHO`).\n            *   Let's assemble them: The two substituents must be `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring.\n            *   The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n            *   Let's verify the formula: `C6H4` (ring) + `C2H3O` (ethanal part) + `NH2` (amine part) = `C8H(4+3+2)NO` = `C8H9NO`. This matches the given molecular formula. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n        *   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at low temperature, typically 0-5 °C)**\n            *   This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The `-NH2` group on the benzene ring is converted to a diazonium salt (`-N2+Cl-`).\n            *   The product of this step is **2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride**.\n\n        *   **Step 2: H2O (usually with warming)**\n            *   This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group (`-N2+`) is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group from water.\n            *   The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n        *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n            *   The reactant is now 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This is an aldehyde that has two acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the `-CH2-` group).\n            *   KOH is a strong base, and heat is supplied. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since there's only one type of aldehyde, it will be a **self-condensation**.\n            *   The mechanism involves two main stages:\n                1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol addition product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n                2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The base removes the now even more acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons. The resulting product is a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde.\n\n    3.  **Determination of the Final Product**\n\n        *   Let R = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The starting material for the aldol is `R-CH2-CHO`.\n        *   The aldol addition product is `R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO`.\n        *   Dehydration of this intermediate yields `R-CH2-CH=C(R)-CHO`.\n        *   Let's name this final structure using IUPAC nomenclature:\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde, C=C).\n            *   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a **but-2-enal**.\n            *   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one attached to C2 and one to the `-CH2-` group at C4.\n            *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    4.  **Matching with Options**\n        *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is the aldol *addition* product, but the reaction is heated, so dehydration will occur.\n        *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal has the wrong substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and the wrong position for the double bond.\n        *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal is missing a second hydroxyphenyl group.\n        *   D) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** matches the expected final product of the aldol condensation reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
