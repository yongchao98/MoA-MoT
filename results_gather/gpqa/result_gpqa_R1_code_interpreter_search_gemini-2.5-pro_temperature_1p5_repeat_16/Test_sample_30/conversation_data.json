    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene.\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (a benzene ring with a methyl group, -CH3) and a nitrating mixture (HNO3 + H2SO4).\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group is an electron-donating group, which activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic attack. It is an *ortho, para* director.\n*   **Product 1:** Two major mononitrated products are formed: *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the *para* isomer is typically the major product. We will follow the reaction pathway of the major product.\n    *   **Product 1 = *para*-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction.\n*   **Reactant 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagent:** Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in sulfuric acid (H2SO4). MnO2 is a mild oxidizing agent that is particularly effective for oxidizing allylic and benzylic positions.\n*   **Mechanism:** While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 would oxidize the methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid, the milder MnO2 is often used to oxidize benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. In this context, it's plausible that it oxidizes the benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. This is a more common transformation for MnO2 than oxidation to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group (-CH3) is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The nitro group (-NO2) is unaffected.\n    *   **Product 2 = *para*-nitrobenzaldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed condensation reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   **Reagents:** Acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**, which is a type of crossed aldol condensation.\n    1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion (`⁻CH2COCH3`).\n    2.  The enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  An aldol addition product is formed, which then readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions, especially since the resulting double bond is conjugated with both the benzene ring and the ketone carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   **Structure:** NO2-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3. The trans isomer (E-isomer) is sterically favored and more stable.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** E-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n        O2N - (Benzene Ring) - CH = CH - C(=O) - CH3\n    ```\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule has an extended conjugated π-system (NO2, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), which strongly favors a planar conformation for the entire heavy-atom backbone.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Let's consider the plane that contains the nitro group, the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group.\n        *   If the molecule adopts this planar conformation, this plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) at the end can be oriented such that one of its C-H bonds lies within this plane, while the other two hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically above and below the plane. The plane reflects these two hydrogens into each other.\n        *   Therefore, the molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cn, n>1):** There is no rotational axis.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. The two ends of the molecule are different (a nitro group vs. an acetyl group).\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nFinal conclusion: The molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
