    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\nThe vector field `f` is defined as:\n*   Its magnitude is `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin.\n*   It points purely in the radial direction.\n\nIn spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, the unit vector in the radial direction is `r̂`. So, the vector field can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) r̂`\n\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Method 1: Direct Calculation of Divergence (with a caveat)\n\nFirst, let's try to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field `f = f_r r̂ + f_θ θ̂ + f_φ φ̂` is:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(f_φ)/∂φ`\n\nIn our case, `f_r = 1/r^2`, and `f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`. Plugging these in:\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r + 0 + 0`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r`\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests that the divergence is zero. If we integrate `0` over any volume, the result would be `0`.\n\nHowever, this result is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin `r = 0`, the field `f` is singular (1/0 is undefined). The standard formula for divergence cannot be applied at this point. The divergence is actually non-zero at the origin in a special way (it's a Dirac delta function), and this single point contributes to the entire value of the integral. To handle this singularity correctly, we should use the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### 3. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a more robust way to solve this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side of the theorem).\n\n1.  **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. So the field is:\n    `f = (1/R^2) r̂`\n\n2.  **The surface element `dS`**: For a sphere of radius `R`, the differential surface element in spherical coordinates is:\n    `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂`\n    The direction `r̂` is radially outward, which is the correct orientation for the Divergence Theorem.\n\n3.  **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`**:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    Notice that the `R^2` terms have conveniently cancelled out.\n\n4.  **The surface integral `∮∮_S`**: Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π`, and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[from φ=0 to 2π] ∫[from θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    Let's evaluate the integrals:\n    *   Inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n        `∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] [from 0 to π]`\n        `= -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   Outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n        `∫[from 0 to 2π] 2 dφ = [2φ] [from 0 to 2π]`\n        `= 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nSo, the surface integral is `4π`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem:\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\nThis is a classic result in physics (related to Gauss's Law for a point charge), where the singularity at the origin acts as a \"source\" of divergence. The total divergence contained within any sphere enclosing the origin is `4π`, regardless of the sphere's radius `R`.\n\nComparing our result to the options:\nA) 4/3 π R\nB) 1\nC) 4 π\nD) 0\n\nThe correct answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
