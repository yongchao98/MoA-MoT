    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge on the conductor is zero. It has a cavity inside.\n2.  **Placing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. If we imagine a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity, the total electric flux through this surface must be zero. This implies that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the charge `+q` inside the cavity must induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. So, a charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface from the conductor's free electrons, a net charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor to maintain overall charge conservation. This `+q` charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The conductor material shields the region outside from the electrostatic influence of the charges inside the cavity. The electric field inside the conductor is zero, effectively isolating the outer surface from the specific arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` within the cavity.\n6.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor will distribute itself in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. For a spherical conductor, the most stable configuration (lowest energy) is a uniform distribution of charge over its surface, regardless of any internal cavities or charges.\n7.  **Calculating the External Electric Field:** Now, we need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The electric field at P is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, due to shielding, the field at P is solely determined by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. We have established that there is a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface of radius `R`.\n8.  **Shell Theorem:** According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is identical to the electric field of a single point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n9.  **Final Calculation:** In our case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is the same as that of a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n10. **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The parameters `r` (cavity radius), `s` (cavity position), `l` (distance from cavity center to P), and `θ` describe the internal geometry. Due to electrostatic shielding, these details do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n    *   Option A, C, and D depend on these internal parameters (`l`, `s`, `θ`), which is incorrect.\n    *   Option B correctly identifies that the field depends only on the total induced charge on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
