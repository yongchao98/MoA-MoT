    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nThe presence of these two elements also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis (S3 = C3 followed by σh). Molecules in the C3h group do *not* have vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**B) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (the CH group).\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a common name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three planar anhydride rings fused to its sides. The entire molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes (and σv planes) means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While D3h contains the symmetry elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is analogous to the one in option D, but it's built on a larger planar triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. The triphenylene core itself has D3h symmetry. Fusing the planar anhydride rings in a symmetrical fashion preserves the overall planarity and high symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Like the molecule in D, this molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, a σh plane (the molecular plane), three perpendicular C2 axes, and three σv planes.\n*   **Point Group:** This molecule also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. The central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. Due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule is flexible and can exist in several conformations.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** We need to find if a stable or plausible conformation exists that has C3h symmetry.\n    *   Let's imagine a conformation:\n        1.  The boron atom and the three oxygen atoms lie in a plane (the B(O)3 core is planar). This plane will be our candidate for the σh mirror plane. The C3 axis will be perpendicular to this plane, passing through the boron atom.\n        2.  For the σh plane to be a true symmetry element, the rest of the molecule must be symmetric upon reflection through this plane.\n        3.  Consider an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Let's arrange it so that its central carbon atom (Cα) and the attached hydrogen (Hα) also lie in the B(O)3 plane.\n        4.  The two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to Cα can then be placed symmetrically, with one above the plane and one below the plane.\n        5.  If all three isopropyl groups adopt this specific arrangement, rotated 120° from each other, the entire molecule will have a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements in this conformation. There are no vertical mirror planes (σv) and no perpendicular C2 axes.\n*   **Point Group:** This specific conformation has exactly the symmetry elements of the **C3h** point group. While other conformations (like a C3 \"propeller\") may exist, this molecule is the only one on the list that can adopt a C3h symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3v\n*   Molecule C: Can have **C3h** symmetry.\n*   Molecule D: D3h\n\nBy elimination, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
