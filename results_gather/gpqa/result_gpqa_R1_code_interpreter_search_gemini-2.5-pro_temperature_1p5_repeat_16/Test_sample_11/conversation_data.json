    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The decay process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic forms of these laws.\n\n2.  **Initial State:**\n    *   The initial particle is a positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   It is stationary, which means its initial momentum (p_initial) is zero.\n    *   Its initial energy (E_initial) is its rest mass energy, E_initial = m_π * c².\n\n3.  **Final State:**\n    *   The final particles are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n    *   Let their momenta be p_μ and p_ν, and their total energies be E_μ and E_ν.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = **p**_μ + **p**_ν (vector sum)\n    *   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this common magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |**p**_μ| = |**p**_ν| = p\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n6.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (p_μ*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   For the neutrino (ν): The rest mass of a neutrino is extremely small and is considered to be zero for this type of calculation. So, m_ν = 0.\n    *   For the neutrino: E_ν² = (p_ν*c)² + (m_ν*c²)² = (pc)² + 0. This simplifies to E_ν = pc.\n\n7.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have two main equations:\n        1.  m_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν\n        2.  E_ν = pc\n    *   Substitute (2) into (1): m_π*c² = E_μ + pc  =>  pc = m_π*c² - E_μ\n    *   Now, take the energy-momentum relation for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   Substitute the expression for `pc` into this equation:\n        E_μ² = (m_π*c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   Expand the squared term:\n        E_μ² = (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   The E_μ² terms on both sides cancel out:\n        0 = (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)E_μ + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   Rearrange to solve for the total energy of the muon, E_μ:\n        2(m_π*c²)E_μ = (m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n        E_μ = [(m_π*c²)² + (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * (m_π*c²)]\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   The rest mass energies are given: m_π*c² = 139.6 MeV and m_μ*c² = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   We can now calculate E_μ. Then, we find the kinetic energies.\n    *   Kinetic Energy (KE) = Total Energy (E) - Rest Mass Energy (mc²).\n    *   KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c²\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its total energy *is* its kinetic energy: KE_ν = E_ν.\n    *   We can find E_ν from the energy conservation equation: E_ν = m_π*c² - E_μ.\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu) from conservation of energy\nE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# The two kinetic energies are KE_mu and KE_nu\nprint(f\"{KE_mu:.2f}, {KE_nu:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n4.12, 29.78\n>>>The calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) is 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.\n\nComparing this result (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Decay and Conservation Laws:**\n    The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν):\n    π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n    This decay must obey the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the products can be relativistic, we must use their relativistic forms.\n\n2.  **Initial State (Before Decay):**\n    *   The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n    *   Its initial momentum (**p**_initial) is therefore zero.\n    *   Its initial total energy (E_initial) is its rest mass energy, E_initial = m_πc².\n\n3.  **Final State (After Decay):**\n    *   The final particles are the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν).\n    *   Let their momenta be **p**_μ and **p**_ν, and their total energies be E_μ and E_ν.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total momentum before the decay is zero, so the total momentum after the decay must also be zero.\n    **p**_initial = **p**_final\n    0 = **p**_μ + **p**_ν\n    This implies **p**_μ = -**p**_ν. The muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this common momentum magnitude as 'p'.\n    |**p**_μ| = |**p**_ν| = p\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n6.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n    *   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n        E_μ² = (pμc)² + (mμc²)² = (pc)² + (mμc²)²  (Eq. 1)\n\n    *   **For the neutrino (ν):**\n        Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in these calculations (mν ≈ 0).\n        E_ν² = (pνc)² + (mνc²)² = (pc)² + 0\n        Therefore, E_ν = pc  (Eq. 2)\n\n7.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We have a system of equations to solve for the unknown energies.\n    *   From energy conservation: E_μ + E_ν = m_πc²\n    *   From Eq. 2, substitute E_ν = pc: E_μ + pc = m_πc²\n    *   Rearrange this to express pc in terms of E_μ: pc = m_πc² - E_μ (Eq. 3)\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for pc (Eq. 3) into the muon's energy-momentum relation (Eq. 1):\n    E_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\n\n    Expand the squared term:\n    E_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n\n    The E_μ² terms cancel out on both sides:\n    0 = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + (m_μc²)²\n\n    Now, solve for the total energy of the muon, E_μ:\n    2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\n    E_μ = [(m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n8.  **Calculate the Energies and Kinetic Energies:**\n    We are given the rest mass energies:\n    *   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\n    First, calculate the total energy of the muon (E_μ):\n    E_μ = [(139.6)² + (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    E_μ = [19488.16 + 11172.49] / 279.2\n    E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\n    Next, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ). Kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV\n\n    Now, find the total energy of the neutrino (E_ν) using the conservation of energy equation:\n    E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ\n    E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV\n\n    For a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy:\n    KE_ν = E_ν = 29.78 MeV\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The kinetic energy of the product particles are:\n    *   KE of muon (μ⁺) = 4.12 MeV\n    *   KE of neutrino (ν) = 29.78 MeV (or 29.8 MeV when rounded)\n\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n    B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n    C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\n    The calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
