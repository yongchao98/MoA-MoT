    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`\n    Here, distance `d` is typically measured in parsecs and parallax `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Understanding the assumption of uniform distribution:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Considering the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, that have a distance between `d` and `d + dd`. These stars are located in a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (Area of sphere) × (thickness) = (4πd²) × dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ × dV = ρ × 4πd² × dd`\n\n4.  **Expressing the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the infinitesimals `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substituting back into the equation for dN:**\n    Now we replace `d` and `dd` in the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation above:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Determining the proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
