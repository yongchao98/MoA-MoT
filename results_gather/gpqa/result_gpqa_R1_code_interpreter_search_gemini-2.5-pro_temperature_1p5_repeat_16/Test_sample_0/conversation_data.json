    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concept\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nThe lifetime of a quantum state (τ) represents the time interval during which the state exists. We can relate this lifetime to the uncertainty in time, Δt ≈ τ. Therefore, a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE, often called the natural linewidth.\n\nThe approximate relationship is:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n### 2. Calculating the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State\n\nWe need to calculate the inherent energy spread (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states. We will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) for convenience.\n\n*   **Reduced Planck Constant (ħ):** ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n*   **Lifetime of State 1 (τ₁):** 10⁻⁹ s\n*   **Lifetime of State 2 (τ₂):** 10⁻⁸ s\n\n**For State 1:**\nThe energy uncertainty is:\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For State 2:**\nThe energy uncertainty is:\nΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\nΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\nΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n### 3. Determining the Condition for Resolution\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy uncertainties. If the energy difference is smaller than the linewidths, the two smeared-out energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\nA common criterion for resolution (similar to the Rayleigh criterion) is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the broader of the two linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁).\n\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe broader linewidth is ΔE₁. Therefore, to resolve the levels, the energy difference must satisfy:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\nNow we compare the given options with our calculated minimum required energy difference:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷). **This is clearly resolvable.**\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nThe only energy difference large enough to ensure the two levels can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo be precise, let's run a short Python script to confirm the values.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The required energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (Delta_E1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (Delta_E2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"\\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be > {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check which option satisfies this condition\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-11,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-9,\n    'D': 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough.\")\n\n```\nExecution output:\n```\nEnergy uncertainty of state 1 (Delta_E1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty of state 2 (Delta_E2): 6.582e-08 eV\n\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV\n\nChecking the options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT large enough.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is large enough.\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT large enough.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT large enough.\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that only option B provides an energy difference sufficient for the two states to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>",
