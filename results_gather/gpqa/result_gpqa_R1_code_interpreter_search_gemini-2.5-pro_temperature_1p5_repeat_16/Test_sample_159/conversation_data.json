    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Shape as N -> ∞:**\n    *   The problem describes an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon.\n    *   A key piece of information is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. It is also the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius).\n    *   As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞), a regular polygon approaches a circle.\n    *   In this limit, the apothem 'a' (the inradius) becomes equal to the radius of the circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Fraunhofer Diffraction):**\n    *   When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern.\n    *   This pattern consists of a bright central maximum (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to intensity minima.\n    *   The angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n3.  **Formula for Minima:**\n    *   The condition for the m-th minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture of radius `r` is given by:\n        `sin(θ_m) = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / r)`\n    *   Here:\n        *   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n        *   `z_m` is the m-th positive zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n        *   `r` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   In our case, the radius of the aperture is `r = a`.\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`.\n    *   The formula becomes: `θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Finding the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   We need the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x). These are well-known values:\n        *   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   Now, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n        *   `θ_1 ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n        *   `θ_2 ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n    *   *Side note:* The famous Rayleigh criterion for the first minimum uses `sin(θ) = 1.22 λ / D`, where D is the diameter (D=2a). This comes from `1.22 ≈ z_1 / π = 3.8317/π`, which gives `sin(θ) = (z_1 / π) * (λ / 2a) = (z_1 / 2π) * (λ / a)`. Our formula is consistent. `0.610 λ/a` is the position of the first minimum, which matches option C, but the question asks for the distance between the first two minima.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n    *   `Δθ = [ (z_2 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ] - [ (z_1 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ]`\n    *   `Δθ = ( (z_2 - z_1) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    *   Plugging in the values for the zeros:\n    *   `Δθ = ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    To get a precise numerical value for the coefficient, we can use a small python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# First two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nz1 = 3.83170597\nz2 = 7.01558667\n\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = ( (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi) ) * (lambda / a)\n# We calculate the coefficient (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\nExecution output:\n```\n0.507\n```\nThe calculation yields a coefficient of approximately 0.507.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 0.506 λ / a\n    C) 0.610 λ / a\n    D) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.507 is closest to 0.506. The small difference is due to rounding of the input values.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides N tends to infinity. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity minima in this pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`.\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a` is given by:\n`sin(θ_m) = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nHere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th positive zero of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The formula simplifies to:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of `J_1(x)`:\n*   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first (`θ_1`) and second (`θ_2`) minima:\n*   `θ_1 = (z_1 / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n*   `θ_2 = (z_2 / (2π)) * (λ / a) = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n`Δθ = [ (z_2 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ] - [ (z_1 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ]`\n`Δθ = ( (z_2 - z_1) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n\nPlugging in the values for the zeros:\n`Δθ = ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nBased on the Python code execution, the coefficient is `0.507`. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
