    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nThe position of electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring is determined by the nature of the substituent already present. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1)**: Alkyl group. It's an activating group and **ortho,para-directing**.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2)**: Ester group (electron-withdrawing). It's a deactivating group and **meta-directing**.\n*   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3)**: Halogen. It's a deactivating group but **ortho,para-directing** due to its lone pairs participating in resonance.\n*   **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4)**: Nitro group (strongly electron-withdrawing). It's a strongly deactivating group and **meta-directing**.\n*   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5)**: Alkyl group. It's an activating group and **ortho,para-directing**.\n*   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6)**: Carboxylic acid group (electron-withdrawing). It's a deactivating group and **meta-directing**.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the para-isomer yields for the two main classes.**\nMeta-directing substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the ortho and para isomers is therefore very low.\nOrtho,para-directing substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para isomer is significant, often being the major product.\nTherefore, any substance with a meta-directing group will have a much lower yield of the para-isomer than any substance with an ortho,para-directing group.\n\nThe overall order will be: {meta-directors} < {ortho,para-directors}.\nSo, {2, 4, 6} < {1, 3, 5}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances with meta-directing groups.**\nThe substances are C6H5-NO2 (4), C6H5-COOC2H5 (2), and C6H5-COOH (6).\nFor these groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to how strongly they deactivate the ring and direct to the meta position. A stronger deactivating/meta-directing group will result in a lower yield of the para product.\nThe order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\nThe -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivators. The -COOH group is more deactivating than the -COOC2H5 group because the electron-donating effect of the ethyl group in the ester slightly counteracts the withdrawal.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances with ortho,para-directing groups.**\nThe substances are C6H5-CH3 (1), C6H5-Cl (3), and C6H5-C2H5 (5).\nThe yield of the para-isomer versus the ortho-isomer depends on a balance of electronic and steric effects.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions more effectively, favoring substitution at the less-hindered para position. The steric bulk increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5. This factor alone would suggest the para yield order is 3 < 1 < 5.\n*   **Electronic Effects:**\n    *   Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5): Both are activating. The larger size of the ethyl group (-C2H5) provides more steric hindrance to ortho attack compared to the methyl group (-CH3). This leads to a higher proportion of the para product for ethylbenzene. So, the para-yield order is **1 < 5**. (Literature values for bromination: Toluene ~67% para, Ethylbenzene ~94% para).\n    *   Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3): The chlorine atom, while smaller than an ethyl group, strongly deactivates the ortho position through its inductive effect. This electronic factor strongly disfavors ortho attack, leading to a very high percentage of the para product. (Literature value for bromination: Chlorobenzene ~89% para).\n*   **Combining these facts:** We need to order 1, 3, and 5 based on their para-isomer yields.\n    *   Para yield of Toluene (1) is ~67%.\n    *   Para yield of Chlorobenzene (3) is ~89%.\n    *   Para yield of Ethylbenzene (5) is ~94%.\n    The experimental data suggests the order of increasing para yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final order and select the best option.**\nBased on our analysis, the complete order of increasing para-isomer yield should be:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\nNow let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nNone of the options exactly match our derived order (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5). This suggests a possible error in the question or options, which is common. We must find the \"best fit\" answer.\n\nLet's re-examine Option C: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   The first part, **4 < 6 < 2**, correctly orders the meta-directing groups based on their deactivating strength. This is a strong point in favor of this option.\n*   The second part, **1 < 5 < 3**, orders the ortho,para-directing groups. This implies Para-Yield(Toluene) < Para-Yield(Ethylbenzene) < Para-Yield(Chlorobenzene). This contradicts our literature data, which shows Para-Yield(Chlorobenzene) < Para-Yield(Ethylbenzene).\n\nHowever, Option C is the only one that correctly orders the meta-directors. The ordering of the ortho-para directors is complex, and the relative order of ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene can be arguable without precise experimental data in front of you (pitting steric hindrance against inductive deactivation). Given that the ordering of meta-directors is more straightforward and C gets it right, it is the most plausible intended answer, assuming a slight inaccuracy in the ordering of the o,p-directors.\n\n<<<C>>>"
