    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds present in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one peak in this region, and an amide would typically be broader.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an ester. Amides are usually lower (1650-1690 cm⁻¹), and carboxylic acids are broader and slightly lower.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (6.5-8.5 ppm):** We see two signals here: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).\n        *   The total integration is 4H, which confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The splitting pattern of two doublets is classic for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent, and the two on the other side are also equivalent, and they split each other into doublets.\n        *   The chemical shifts give clues about the substituents. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely adjacent to an electron-donating group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. An amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, and an ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing. This fits the data.\n\n    *   **Aliphatic and Other Regions (0-5 ppm):**\n        *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is typical for the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH₂). The IR data already strongly suggested this functional group. Its chemical shift is consistent with an aniline-type amine.\n        *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a classic ethyl group pattern.\n            *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is a methyl group (-CH₃) split by an adjacent methylene group (-CH₂).\n            *   The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is a methylene group (-CH₂) split by an adjacent methyl group (-CH₃).\n            *   The highly downfield shift of the methylene group (4.5 ppm) indicates it's attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context must be the oxygen of an ester (-COO-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    4.  Placing the electron-donating -NH₂ and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group on the 1,4-positions of the benzene ring is consistent with all NMR data (proton counts, splitting, and chemical shifts).\n    5.  This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Wrong functional groups (amide, not ester) and wrong substitution pattern (meta, not para).\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and the ¹H NMR (broad singlet for NH₂).\n    *   C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ester linkage is different (CH₃CH₂COO-Ar). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
