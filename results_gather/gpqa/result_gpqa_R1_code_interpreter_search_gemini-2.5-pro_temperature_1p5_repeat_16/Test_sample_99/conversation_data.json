    "*   **Step 1: Identify Compound A, B, and C**\n    *   Compound A has the molecular formula C3H6. This corresponds to either propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n    *   It undergoes bromination in CCl4, a reaction characteristic of compounds with double or triple bonds (test for unsaturation). Propene has a double bond.\n    *   **A (Propene) + Br2/CCl4 → B**: This is an electrophilic addition reaction across the double bond.\n        CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   **Compound B** is 1,2-Dibromopropane.\n    *   **B + alcoholic KOH → C**: Compound B reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide. This is a double dehydrohalogenation reaction, which eliminates two molecules of HBr to form an alkyne.\n        CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 alc. KOH → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   **Compound C** is Propyne.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Compound D**\n    *   **C --(red-hot Fe tube)--> D**: Passing an alkyne through a red-hot iron tube results in cyclic polymerization. Three molecules of propyne (CH3-C≡CH) will trimerize to form a substituted benzene. To minimize steric hindrance between the methyl groups, they will arrange themselves at positions 1, 3, and 5 on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Compound D** is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as Mesitylene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Compound E and F**\n    *   **D + (mixture of two strong acids) → E**: Mesitylene (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This is the standard condition for nitration (a mixture of concentrated nitric acid, HNO3, and concentrated sulfuric acid, H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n        Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene\n    *   **Compound E** is 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene. (All three positions available for substitution are equivalent).\n    *   **E + Fe/HCl → F**: The nitro group in E is reduced to an amino group (-NH2) using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid. This is a standard method for preparing anilines from nitrobenzenes.\n        2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 2,4,6-trimethylaniline\n    *   **Compound F** is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify Compound G and H**\n    *   **F + HNO2 → G**: F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically made in-situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures, 0-5°C). This is a diazotization reaction, which forms a diazonium salt.\n    *   **Compound G** is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt.\n    *   **G + NaOH → H**: The diazonium salt (G) is warmed with a base (NaOH) or just water. This causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.\n    *   **Compound H** is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the statements**\n\n    *   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n        *   F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are key precursors in the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized (like in the step to form G) and then coupled with another aromatic compound (like a phenol or another amine) to produce a colored dye. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n        *   D is Mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons:\n            1.  The three aromatic protons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a singlet.\n            2.  The nine protons of the three methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are equivalent. These also appear as a singlet.\n        *   Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n        *   C is Propyne (CH3-C≡CH). It has a boiling point of -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. Like other short-chain hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n    *   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n        *   H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The neutral ferric chloride (FeCl3) test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color. However, this test does not work for phenols where the -OH group is sterically hindered by bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions next to the OH group). In H, the two methyl groups at positions 2 and 6 block the -OH group, preventing the formation of the colored iron complex. Therefore, H does not give a positive FeCl3 test. No characteristic color change is observed. The statement that it gives a yellow color is **incorrect**.\n\nThe incorrect statement is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
