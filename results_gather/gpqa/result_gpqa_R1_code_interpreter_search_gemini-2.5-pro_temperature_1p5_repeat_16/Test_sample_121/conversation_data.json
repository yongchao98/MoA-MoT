    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents points towards an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the hydrogens on the methyl group is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the carbon alpha to the ester group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two strong electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile -CN and an ester -COOEt).\n    2.  Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these acidic protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (an enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    3.  This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt + Br⁻\n    4.  The resulting molecule still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon. Since NaH is in excess, it removes this second proton to form another carbanion.\n        NC-CH( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C( (CH2)5Br )-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    5.  This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring. Ring formation is entropically and kinetically favored over intermolecular reactions.\n*   **Product 4 Structure:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)cyclohexane. It consists of a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is substituted with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** Product 4 is a 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane. The two \"groups\" defining the ring connectivity from C1 (-CH2-CH2-...) are identical. Therefore, C1 is a prochiral center, and the molecule as a whole is **achiral**. It possesses a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the (time-averaged) ethoxycarbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Chemical Equivalence based on Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the ring carbons C2 and C6 equivalent. It also makes C3 and C5 equivalent.\n    *   Protons that can be interchanged by this plane of symmetry (enantiotopic protons) are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral solvent) 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Geminal protons (on the same CH2 group) on a cyclohexane ring are generally diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and give separate signals. This holds true even with rapid chair flipping for substituted cyclohexanes.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to rapid rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are enantiotopic due to the molecular plane of symmetry. Thus, they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        3.  **C2 and C6:** These carbons are equivalent. The axial protons on C2 and C6 are enantiotopic and give one signal. The equatorial protons on C2 and C6 are also enantiotopic and give another signal. The axial and equatorial protons themselves are diastereotopic. So, these four protons give **2 signals**.\n        4.  **C3 and C5:** Same logic as C2/C6. These four protons give **2 signals**.\n        5.  **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (one axial, one equatorial) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic and thus give **2 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    Summing up the distinct signals:\n    1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2-H/C6-H) + 2 (from C3-H/C5-H) + 2 (from C4-H) = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
