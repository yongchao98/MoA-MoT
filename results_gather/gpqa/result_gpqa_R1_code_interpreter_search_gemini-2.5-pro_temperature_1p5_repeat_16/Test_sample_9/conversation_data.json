    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n1.  **Analyze each option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is, by definition, a planet with the same density as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". Planets are held together by their own gravity. A more massive planet has stronger gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material (rock and iron, in this case) to a much greater degree than on a less massive planet. This compression leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"sub-Earth\". With less mass, the gravitational compression is weaker. The same amount of material will occupy a relatively larger volume compared to its mass, resulting in a lower overall density than Earth.\n\n2.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to significant gravitational compression).\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth but has the same composition (c) will be compressed by its own gravity to a much greater extent than the others. This self-compression results in the highest density. The planet in option (d) would have the lowest density, while planets (a) and (b) have densities nearly identical to Earth's.\n\nTherefore, the planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
