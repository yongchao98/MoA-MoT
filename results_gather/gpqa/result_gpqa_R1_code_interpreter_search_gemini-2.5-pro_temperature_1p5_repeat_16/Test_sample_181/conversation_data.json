    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Equation:** The Mott-Gurney equation is given: $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$.\n    *   **Context:** This equation describes the dark current (J) vs. voltage (V) in the Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC) regime.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct set of physical conditions under which this specific equation is valid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Concept: Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC):**\n    *   What does \"Space-Charge-Limited\" mean? It means that a large number of charge carriers are *injected* from a contact into a material (which is typically an insulator or a wide-bandgap semiconductor with very few intrinsic carriers).\n    *   These injected carriers form a \"cloud\" of charge (a space charge) within the device.\n    *   This space charge creates its own electric field, which opposes further injection of charge.\n    *   The current is therefore *limited* by this space-charge effect within the bulk of the material, not by the ability of the contact to supply carriers or the material's intrinsic conductivity.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Assumptions for the *Standard* Mott-Gurney Equation:**\n    *   **Carrier Transport Mechanism:** The current is driven by the applied electric field. This is called **drift current**. The current due to concentration gradients, known as **diffusion current**, is assumed to be small enough to be ignored. The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law starts from the drift-diffusion equations but neglects the diffusion term.\n    *   **Number of Carrier Types:** The simple Mott-Gurney model assumes that only one type of carrier is mobile and contributes to the current (e.g., either electrons or holes are injected and transported). Therefore, it applies to a **single-carrier device**. If both electrons and holes were present in significant numbers, recombination would occur, which requires a more complex model.\n    *   **Traps:** The equation $J \\propto V^2$ is the ideal case. It assumes the semiconductor or insulator material is perfectly free of defects or **traps** that can capture the moving carriers. If traps were present, the current-voltage relationship would be different (often steeper, with J proportional to V^m where m > 2, until the traps are filled).\n    *   **Injecting Contact:** For the current to be limited by the space charge in the bulk, the contact must be able to supply as many carriers as needed without any hindrance. This type of contact is called an **Ohmic contact**, which, by definition, has **no (or a negligible) carrier injection barrier**. If the contact had a significant barrier (like a Schottky contact), the current would be limited by the injection process at the contact, not the space charge in the bulk. This would lead to a different J-V relationship (e.g., thermionic emission).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   `trap-free single-carrier device`: Correct.\n        *   `Ohmic contact`: Correct.\n        *   `negligible drift current`: **Incorrect**. SCLC *is* a drift-dominated current. This is a fatal flaw in the statement.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `single-carrier device`: Correct.\n        *   `Schottky contact`: **Incorrect**. A Schottky contact typically creates an injection barrier, leading to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current. An Ohmic contact is required.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: Correct.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `trap-free single-carrier device`: Correct.\n        *   `no carrier injection barrier`: Correct. This is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact, which is a required condition.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: Correct. The model assumes drift is the dominant transport mechanism.\n        *   This option aligns perfectly with all the derived requirements.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   `two-carrier device`: **Incorrect**. The standard Mott-Gurney law is a single-carrier model.\n        *   `Ohmic contact`: Correct.\n        *   `negligible diffusion current`: Correct.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Option C is the only statement where all the conditions are correct and consistent with the physical model of space-charge-limited current as described by the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
