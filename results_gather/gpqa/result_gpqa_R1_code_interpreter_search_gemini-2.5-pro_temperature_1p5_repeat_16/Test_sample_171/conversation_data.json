    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The key information is that the stars' photospheres are in **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)**. This assumption allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is:\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j and N_i are the number of atoms in the higher energy state (j) and lower energy state (i), respectively.\n*   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the states (these are constants for a given transition in an atom).\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two states (E_j - E_i).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Translate the Problem into Equations\nLet's denote the excited state as 'exc' and the ground state as 'gnd'. The ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms for a given star is a measure of its \"excitation\".\n\nLet R_1 be the excitation ratio for star_1 (temperature T_1) and R_2 be the excitation ratio for star_2 (temperature T_2).\nR_1 = (N_exc / N_gnd)_1\nR_2 = (N_exc / N_gnd)_2\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to ... star_2\". This means:\nR_1 = 2 * R_2\n\nNow, let's write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\nFor star_1:\nR_1 = (g_exc / g_gnd) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFor star_2:\nR_2 = (g_exc / g_gnd) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nThe energy difference ΔE and the statistical weights (g_exc, g_gnd) are the same for the iron atoms in both stars.\n\n### 3. Solve the Equations\nSubstitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship R_1 = 2 * R_2:\n(g_exc / g_gnd) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_exc / g_gnd) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\nThe term with the statistical weights, (g_exc / g_gnd), is on both sides, so it cancels out:\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\nln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(exp(x)) = x:\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n(ΔE / k) * [ 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 ] = ln(2)\n\nFind a common denominator for the term in the brackets:\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n### 4. Use the Given Numerical Values\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information:\n*   The energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n*   The Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the constant factor (ΔE / k):\n(ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n(1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThe options provided in the question are presented without explicit physical constants. This is a common convention in physics problems where the constants are chosen to be numerically equal to 1. In this case, the constant (ΔE / k) is numerically 1 (in SI units of Kelvin). By treating this constant as the dimensionless number 1, the equation becomes:\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\nLet's compare this final expression with the given choices:\nA) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nOur derived relationship exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
