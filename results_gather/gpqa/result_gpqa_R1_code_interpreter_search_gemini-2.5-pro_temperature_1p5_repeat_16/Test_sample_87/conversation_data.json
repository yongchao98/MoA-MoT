    "The user wants me to identify a specific biological process based on a described experiment.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Setup and Observations:**\n\n*   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus.\n*   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This means the antigen enters the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n*   **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs associated with the gut (GALT - Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue). The fluorescence indicates the antigen has reached these sites.\n*   **Cell Population:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from these patches. In secondary lymphoid organs, antigen presentation leads to the clonal expansion (proliferation) of specific lymphocytes, primarily B cells and T cells. The subsequent information points towards B cells.\n*   **Key Molecular Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" reveals \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain (VH) is a critical part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies it will eventually secrete. This region determines the antigen-binding specificity.\n\n**2. Analyze the Options in the Context of the Findings:**\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's function (e.g., where it is secreted) but does **not** change the *variable* region or its antigen-binding specificity. The question specifies variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene. So, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM intentionally introduces point mutations into the DNA sequences of the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected for survival and proliferation. This process is the direct cause of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" during an active immune response. This perfectly matches the observations.\n\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system, a cascade of proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic recombination or mutation in lymphocytes. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors and T cell receptors. It occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during their development, *before* they encounter any antigen. The scenario described is happening *after* antigen exposure in a *secondary* lymphoid organ. While V(D)J recombination creates the initial template, the *high variability* observed in a proliferating, antigen-specific population is a result of a secondary process. Therefore, this is not the process being described in the Peyer's patch.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe experimental findings—proliferation of cells in a secondary lymphoid organ after antigen exposure, coupled with high variability specifically in the variable region of the heavy chain gene—are the defining characteristics of somatic hypermutation occurring within a germinal center reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
