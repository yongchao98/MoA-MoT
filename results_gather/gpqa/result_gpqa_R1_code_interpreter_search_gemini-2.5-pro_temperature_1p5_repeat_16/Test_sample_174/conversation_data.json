    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an oscillating spheroid charge distribution. An oscillating charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves. The spheroid shape, with oscillations along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when observed in the radiation zone (far from the source) and assuming the wavelength of radiation is much larger than the size of the spheroid. This is a standard approximation in classical electrodynamics.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiation:** For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle `θ` measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis). The formula is:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation and the magnitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Maximum Radiated Power:** The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n    So, the maximum power per unit solid angle, which is given as `A` in the problem, is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1² = C`\n    This means the constant `C` is equal to the maximum power `A`. So we can write the power at any angle as:\n    `dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:** The question asks for the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We need to calculate `(dP/dΩ)` at `θ = 30°` and divide it by `A`.\n    Power at 30° = `A * sin²(30°)`\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / `A` = `(A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Wavelength Dependence:** The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function `f` of wavelength `λ` and angle `θ`. We have already established the angular part. Now, let's look at the wavelength dependence.\n    From electrodynamics, the total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n    `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n    The power per unit solid angle `dP/dΩ` has the same frequency dependence.\n    So, `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴ * sin²(θ)`\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc / λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `f(λ, θ) ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴ * sin²(θ) ∝ 1/λ⁴ * sin²(θ)`\n    Thus, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This is the basis for Rayleigh scattering (e.g., why the sky is blue).\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form of the function `f(λ, θ)` describing the power per unit solid angle includes a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Now let's examine the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³ - Fraction is correct, but wavelength dependence is incorrect.\n    B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴ - Fraction is incorrect, but wavelength dependence is correct.\n    C) 3/4, λ⁻⁶ - Both are incorrect.\n    D) 1/4, λ⁻⁴ - Both the fraction and the wavelength dependence are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
