    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$. The maximum observed shift, or amplitude, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted by $K$.\n\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio between the RV amplitudes of the two stars based on the given wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** The formula for the RV amplitude, $K$, connects it to the properties of the star-planet system. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_s^{2/3}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:** The problem provides the following crucial information to simplify the relationship:\n    *   **Same stellar masses:** $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   **Circular orbits:** This means eccentricity $e=0$, which is already accounted for in the simplified formula above.\n    *   **\"masses similar to that of Neptune\":** In RV measurements, astronomers can only determine the *minimum mass* of a planet, which is the product $m_p \\sin(i)$, because the true mass $m_p$ is degenerate with the unknown inclination angle $i$. Therefore, the most logical interpretation of this statement is that the measurable quantity, $m_p \\sin(i)$, is the same for both planets. So, $m_{p1} \\sin(i_1) = m_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n4.  **Establish the Proportionality:** With $M_s$ and $m_p \\sin(i)$ being the same for both systems, the formula for $K$ simplifies to a proportionality with the orbital period $T$:\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n    This means the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. A larger RV signal implies a shorter period, and vice-versa.\n\n5.  **Form the Ratio of Periods:** Now we can write the ratio of the RV amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(\\text{const}) \\cdot T_2^{-1/3}}{(\\text{const}) \\cdot T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We can now substitute the known value of the K-ratio and solve for the desired period ratio, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$.\n    $$ 1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the ratio, first cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ (1.4)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    $$ 2.744 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which corresponds to the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. We find this by taking the reciprocal of our result:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} $$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\nTo get the precise numerical answer, we perform the calculation.\n```python\nratio_K = 7 / 5\n# From the derivation, T1/T2 = (K2/K1)^3\nratio_T1_over_T2 = ratio_K**3\n# The question asks for T2/T1, which is the reciprocal\nratio_T2_over_T1 = 1 / ratio_T1_over_T2\nprint(ratio_T2_over_T1)\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
