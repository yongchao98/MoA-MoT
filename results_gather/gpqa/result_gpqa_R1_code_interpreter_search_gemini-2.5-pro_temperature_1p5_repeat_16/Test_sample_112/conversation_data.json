    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid dimer. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acids causes this peak to be very broad and shifted to a lower wavenumber compared to the O-H stretch of an alcohol (typically 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The value is slightly lower than a simple saturated acid (1710 cm⁻¹), which could indicate conjugation.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretching vibration.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the interpretation of the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key fragment for identifying the functional group. Let's calculate the mass of a potential fragment:\n    *   The carboxyl group, -COOH, has a mass of: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45 amu.\n    *   The fragment [COOH]⁺ is a very common and diagnostically significant fragment for carboxylic acids in mass spectrometry.\n\n**Mass Spectrometry Conclusion:** The m/z = 45 peak confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, we have established that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains:\n1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n2.  An alkene group (C=C), which contains a C=C double bond.\n\nThis structure requires a total of **two degrees of unsaturation** (one for the C=O and one for the C=C). It must also contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** Has only one oxygen. Incorrect, as a carboxylic acid needs two.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Has two oxygens. Let's calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU).\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   This formula only has one degree of unsaturation, which is not enough to account for both a C=O and a C=C double bond. Incorrect.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has two oxygens. Let's calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O and one C=C bond. **Correct**.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:** Has only one oxygen. Incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **C₆H₁₀O₂**. An example of such a molecule would be 4-methylpent-2-enoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
