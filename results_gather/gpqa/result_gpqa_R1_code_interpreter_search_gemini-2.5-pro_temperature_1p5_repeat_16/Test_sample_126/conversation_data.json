    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's break down the name to draw its structure:\n    *   **nona-**: The main carbon chain has 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   **-2,6-diene**: There are two double bonds in the chain, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   **5-butyl-**: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    The structure is as follows (numbering the main chain from left to right):\n    `CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)`\n    The butyl group (C₄H₉) is `-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type**\n    Heating a molecule containing a 1,5-diene system strongly suggests a **[3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement**, specifically a **Cope rearrangement**. A sigmatropic rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond migrates across a pi system. The Cope rearrangement involves a hexa-1,5-diene system.\n\n3.  **Identify the 1,5-Diene System in the Reactant**\n    We need to find a `C=C-C-C-C=C` pattern in the molecule. Let's trace the carbon backbone connecting the two double bonds (`C2=C3` and `C6=C7`):\n    `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`\n    This sequence of 6 carbons forms a hexa-1,5-diene moiety, which is the requirement for a Cope rearrangement. For clarity, let's re-number these specific six carbons from 1' to 6':\n    `C2(1')=C3(2') - C4(3') - C5(4') - C6(5')=C7(6')`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism**\n    In a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement:\n    *   The sigma bond between atoms 3' and 4' breaks. In our molecule, this is the **C4-C5** bond.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between atoms 1' and 6'. In our molecule, this is a new bond between **C2 and C7**.\n    *   The pi bond between 1' and 2' moves to 2' and 3'. The `C2=C3` double bond moves to become **`C3=C4`**.\n    *   The pi bond between 5' and 6' moves to 4' and 5'. The `C6=C7` double bond moves to become **`C5=C6`**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule. We keep all original atoms and substituents but change the bonding according to the mechanism above.\n    *   The original C4-C5 bond is broken.\n    *   A new C2-C7 bond is formed.\n    *   The product has new double bonds at C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n\n    Let's assemble the product structure by showing the new connections between the molecular fragments:\n    *   The `C1-C2-C3-C4` part of the reactant (`CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-`) becomes `CH₃-CH-CH=CH₂`. This fragment is connected to the rest of the molecule via C2. C2 now has the C1 methyl group, is single-bonded to C3, and has the new single bond to C7.\n    *   The `C5-C6-C7-C8-C9` part with the butyl group (`-CH(Butyl)-CH=CH-Et`) becomes `-(Butyl)C=CH-CH(Et)-`. This fragment is connected via C7. C7 is now single-bonded to C6, single-bonded to C2, and still has the ethyl group.\n\n    Combining these pieces via the new C2-C7 bond gives the following structure:\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=C(H)(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)`\n    Let's verify the atoms involved:\n    `(C4=C3) - C2(with C1-Me) - C7(with C8,C9-Et) - C6=C5(with Butyl group)`\n\n6.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Rules**\n    Now we must find the longest continuous carbon chain in the product that contains the principal functional groups (the double bonds).\n    *   **Find the longest chain:** Let's trace the possible chains.\n        `C4=C3-C2-C7-C6=C5-(Butyl chain)`\n        The carbons are `C4, C3, C2, C7, C6, C5`, and then the four carbons of the butyl group.\n        The total length is 2 (from vinyl end) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C7) + 1 (C6) + 1 (C5) + 4 (from butyl group) = 10 carbons.\n        This is a **deca-** chain.\n    *   **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        Let's number from the `C4` end (left side of our drawing):\n        `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(5)=C(6)(...)-CH₂(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)-CH₃(10)`\n        The double bonds start at positions 1 and 5. The locant set is (1, 5).\n        If we number from the other end (the butyl chain), the double bonds would start at positions 5 and 9.\n        The set (1, 5) is lower than (5, 9), so we number from the `C4=C3-` end. The chain is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   **Identify and locate substituents:**\n        On position 3 of our new chain (which is the original C2), there is a **methyl** group (original C1).\n        On position 4 of our new chain (which is the original C7), there is an **ethyl** group (original C8 and C9).\n    *   **Assemble the full name:** We list the substituents alphabetically.\n        **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   C) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (Identical to A)\n\n    Our derived name, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
