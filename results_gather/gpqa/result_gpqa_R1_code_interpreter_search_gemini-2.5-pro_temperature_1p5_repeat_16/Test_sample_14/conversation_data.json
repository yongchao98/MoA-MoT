    "Answering this question requires calculating the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\n### 1. Formula for Transit Probability\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, assuming a circular orbit and random inclination, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`):\n\n`p_transit = R_s / a`\n\n### 2. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis (`a`)\n\nTo find the semi-major axis, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. For a planet with mass `m_p` orbiting a star with mass `M_s`, the law is:\n\n`P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * (M_s + m_p))) * a^3`\n\nwhere:\n- `P` is the orbital period.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets are \"Earth-like,\" their mass `m_p` is negligible compared to the stellar mass `M_s` (`M_s + m_p ≈ M_s`). The formula simplifies to:\n\n`P^2 ≈ (4 * π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n`a^3 ≈ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n`a ≈ ( (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2) )^(1/3)`\n\nThis shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula:\n\n`p_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s^(1/3) * P^(2/3))`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (`p_1`) to that of Planet_2 (`p_2`):\n\n`p_1 / p_2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1^(1/3) * P1^(2/3))] / [R_s2 / (M_s2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3))]`\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\n`p_1 / p_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Given Values\n\nLet's use the information provided in the problem:\n- Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n- The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`, so `P2 / P1 = 3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n\n`p_1 / p_2 = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n`p_1 / p_2 = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`p_1 / p_2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`p_1 / p_2 = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n### 5. Computing the Final Value\n\nTo find the numerical value, we calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n1.650964018494955\n```\n\nThe ratio `p_1 / p_2` is approximately 1.65. This means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis, `p = R_s / a`.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis `a` is related to the orbital period `P` and the stellar mass `M_s` by `a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2`. Thus, `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\nSubstituting this into the probability equation, we get `p ∝ R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\nTo find which planet is more likely to transit, we can compute the ratio of their probabilities, `p_1 / p_2`:\n\n`p_1 / p_2 = [R_{s1} / (M_{s1} * P_1^2)^(1/3)] / [R_{s2} / (M_{s2} * P_2^2)^(1/3)]`\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n`p_1 / p_2 = (R_{s1} / R_{s2}) * (M_{s2} / M_{s1})^(1/3) * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following relationships:\n- The host stars have the same radii: `R_{s1} = R_{s2}`, so `R_{s1} / R_{s2} = 1`.\n- The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host of Planet_2: `M_{s1} = 2 * M_{s2}`, so `M_{s2} / M_{s1} = 1/2`.\n- The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, so `P_2 / P_1 = 3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n\n`p_1 / p_2 = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n`p_1 / p_2 = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`p_1 / p_2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`p_1 / p_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n\n`p_1 / p_2 ≈ 1.65096`\n\nThis means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
