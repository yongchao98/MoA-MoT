    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     H\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n        *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, reacting it with an achiral reagent (mCPBA) will produce either a meso compound or a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n        *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n        *   Attack from the top face produces (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Attack from the bottom face produces (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   These two products are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are enantiomers. The reaction produces a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of these two enantiomers.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (H2O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n        *   Let's consider the ring-opening of one of the epoxide enantiomers, for example, (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The water molecule can attack either C4 or C5. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, both attacks are equally probable and lead to the same product.\n        *   If water attacks C4, the stereochemistry at C4 is inverted (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   If water attacks C5, the stereochemistry at C5 is inverted (R → S), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   (4S, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol are two names for the same molecule. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion), making it a *meso* compound.\n        *   Performing the same analysis on the other enantiomer, (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, also yields the same meso-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*(Stereochemistry Mnemonic: The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation. For a **T**rans alkene, **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso product (T-A-M).)*\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n                   \\   /\n                    C=C\n                   /   \\\n                  H     H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H3O+).\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n        *   Because the starting alkene has a plane of symmetry, and the addition is *syn*, the resulting epoxide will also have a plane of symmetry.\n        *   This means the product is a single *meso* compound: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening (H3O+):** The *anti*-addition of water to the meso-epoxide will open the ring.\n        *   Let's analyze the attack on meso-((4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   If water attacks C4 (which is R), the stereocenter is inverted (R → S), and C5 remains S. The product is **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   If water attacks C5 (which is S), the stereocenter is inverted (S → R), and C4 remains R. The product is **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   The two products, (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of these two enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*(Stereochemistry Mnemonic: For a **C**is alkene, **A**nti-addition gives **E**nantiomers (a racemic mixture) (C-A-E).)*\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols. The (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will thus have different retention times, appearing as separate peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture:\n        *   The meso-diol will separate from the enantiomeric pair (since they are diastereomers). This gives **Peak 1**.\n        *   The two enantiomers, (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol, will co-elute. This gives **Peak 2**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Diastereomers will also be separated.\n    *   In our mixture, all three distinct stereoisomers will be resolved:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
