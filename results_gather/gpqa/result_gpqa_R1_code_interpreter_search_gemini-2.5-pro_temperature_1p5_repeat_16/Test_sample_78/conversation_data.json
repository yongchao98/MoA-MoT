    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the product's NMR spectra to determine its structure.**\n\n    *   **13C NMR:**\n        *   The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, most likely a ketone or aldehyde.\n        *   The signals in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 126.9 - 144.1) along with the aliphatic signals (δ 21.3, 28.4) account for all 11 carbons of the formula C11H12O. The starting material also has this formula, indicating the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   δ 2.31 (3H, s): This is a methyl group singlet. Its chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (a tolyl group). Combined with the p-disubstituted pattern, this points to a **p-tolyl group** (p-CH3-C6H4-).\n        *   δ 2.28 (3H, s): This is a second methyl group singlet. A singlet indicates it has no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl ketone (-CO-CH3), especially one conjugated with a double bond.\n        *   Absence of a signal at δ 9-10 ppm rules out an aldehyde, confirming the carbonyl is a ketone.\n        *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): These are two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). They are doublets because they are coupled to each other. Their different chemical shifts indicate they are in different electronic environments.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        *   We have a p-tolyl group, a ketone group, a second methyl group, and a -CH=CH- double bond.\n        *   The only way to assemble these fragments to match the formula C11H12O and the NMR data is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   Structure: `p-CH3`-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3.\n        *   Let's verify this structure against the data:\n            *   `p-tolyl` group: CH3 at ~2.3-2.4 ppm (matches 2.31), two 2H doublets for aromatic protons (matches 7.08, 7.71).\n            *   Methyl ketone: -CO-CH3 gives a 3H singlet at ~2.2-2.3 ppm (matches 2.28).\n            *   Conjugated system: The α-proton (to C=O) of the double bond is expected around 6.7 ppm (matches 6.75), and the β-proton is further downfield, ~7.6 ppm (matches 7.68).\n        *   The structure of the product is confidently identified.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the starting material (Compound X).**\n\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization (rearrangement), meaning the starting material X must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and the same core skeleton as the product.\n    *   The product contains a **p-tolyl group**. A chemical rearrangement under these conditions will not alter the substitution pattern of the benzene ring. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n    *   Let's examine the options provided:\n        *   A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a styryl group (C6H5-CH=CH-), which is connected to a monosubstituted benzene ring (phenyl group). This cannot be X.\n        *   B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group, which also comes from a monosubstituted benzene ring. This cannot be X.\n        *   C) 2-styrylepoxide: Has the wrong formula (C10H10O) and contains a phenyl group. This cannot be X.\n        *   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH3`-C6H4-CH=CH-. This contains a p-tolyl group. This is the only option with the correct aromatic substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the reaction.**\n\n    *   The reaction transforms Compound X (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane) into the product ((E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n    *   Reactant D: `p-CH3`-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2\n    *   Product: `p-CH3`-C6H4-CH=CH-CO-CH3\n    *   This is an isomerization where the ` -CH(O)CH2` (epoxide) part of the molecule rearranges into a ` -CO-CH3` (methyl ketone) group. This type of rearrangement of vinyl epoxides to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a known transformation that can be promoted by heat and/or a base like DABCO. The reaction is chemically plausible.\n\n    *   Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
