    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of two salts, A and B, which decompose entirely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a precipitate, CaCO₃). The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means there were no acidic gases like CO₂ in the mixture. This implies the original salts did not contain carbonate (CO₃²⁻) or similar anions.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This increase in mass is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen is 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = mass / atomic mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    The source of this oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas from the decomposition. Common gases from heating nitrogen-based salts include N₂O (nitrous oxide) and O₂.\n    Let's hypothesize the gas is N₂O. The reaction with copper is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms to form CuO. Therefore, the amount of N₂O that reacted is 0.05 mol. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    This final gas C must be chemically inert to all the reagents used. It consists of any inert gas from the original decomposition plus any inert gas formed in the tubes. Following our hypothesis for tube 3, the final gas C (0.10 mol) is composed of the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction (0.05 mol) and another inert gas that was present from the initial decomposition. The amount of this initial inert gas is 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol. A very likely candidate for this inert gas is N₂ itself.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial Products**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gas mixture produced by heating salts A and B consists of:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂O\n*   0.05 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products contain only nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The salts decompose completely into gases. This strongly suggests that A and B are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoacids. Let's consider the thermal decomposition of two common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. If A is NH₄NO₂ and B is NH₄NO₃:\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produces `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total amounts of products would be:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n`\n*   Total moles of N₂O = `n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n\nNow, let's compare this with our derived product amounts:\n*   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of H₂O = 0.20 mol => `4n` = 0.20 => `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe results are perfectly consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (moles of NH₄NO₂) × (Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂) + (moles of NH₄NO₃) × (Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃)\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
