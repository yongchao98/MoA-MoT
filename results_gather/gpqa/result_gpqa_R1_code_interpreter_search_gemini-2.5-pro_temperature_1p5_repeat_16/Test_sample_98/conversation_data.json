    "**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer, where the broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the options. The final identification must come from the ¹H NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described. A signal's multiplicity is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This tells us that the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Three neighboring protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3)\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This tells us that the proton responsible for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   Two neighboring protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2)\n\nNow, we must examine the structure of each option to see which one contains protons with the required sets of neighbors. The most likely candidates for such complex splitting are the methine protons (CH) at the chiral centers.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each formula to avoid ambiguity and analyze its structure. The main chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `CH₃(g)CH₂(f)-CH(e)(CH₃)d-CH(b)(CH₃)c-COOH(a)`\n    *   Proton **H_e** (at C3) is coupled to H_b (1H), H_f (2H), and H_d (3H). This would give a **dqt**, matching one of the signals.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to sets of 1H, 2H, and 2H neighbors to give a **dtt**. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `(CH₃)₂CH(c)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n    *   Proton **H_b** (at C3) is coupled to H_a (2H), H_c (1H), and the methyl protons on C3 (3H). This gives a **tqd** (or **dtq**), matching one signal.\n    *   Again, there is no proton that would give a **dtt**. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ of the ethyl at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ of the main chain at C4 (2H). This gives a **dtt**, matching one signal.\n    *   However, no proton has the correct combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a **dtq**. The methylene protons in the ethyl and pentyl chains will give `ddq` patterns. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    Let's parse this formula: `[CH₃]-[CH(C₂H₅)]-[CH(C₂H₅)]-[CH₂COOH]`\n    The longest chain containing the COOH group makes this a hexanoic acid derivative. Its name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw and label the key protons on the backbone:\n    \n          CH₃(a)    Et(f)\n          |         |\n    CH₃CH₂(c)-CH(b) - CH(e) - CH₂(d) - COOH\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H_b (at C4):**\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton **H_e** (1H) → doublet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons **H_c** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methyl protons **H_a** (3H) → quartet.\n        *   The resulting signal for H_b is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal description.\n\n    *   **Analyze proton H_e (at C3):**\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton **H_b** (1H) → doublet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons **H_d** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   It is coupled to the methylene protons of its ethyl group, **H_f** (2H) → triplet.\n        *   The resulting signal for H_e is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal description.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure D, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that has protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
