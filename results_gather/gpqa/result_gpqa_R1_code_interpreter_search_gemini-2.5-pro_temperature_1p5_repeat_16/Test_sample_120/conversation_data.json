    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n        *   The name describes a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The base structure, 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is the IUPAC name for 1,2-epoxycyclohexane (or cyclohexene oxide).\n        *   The bridgehead carbons of the bicyclic system are C1 and C6. The oxygen atom (7-oxa) forms the epoxide ring with C1 and C6.\n        *   There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n        *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We will use these configurations to determine the outcome of the reaction.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate. This is a Gilman reagent, a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me-).\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction Mechanism**\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   The problem statement provides two crucial rules for this specific type of reaction:\n        1.  **Regioselectivity:** \"The alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n        2.  **Stereoselectivity:** \"Inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu [the nucleophile] is added.\" This is characteristic of an SN2 reaction.\n\n3.  **Apply the Rules to the Reaction**\n    *   **Regioselectivity:** The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We need to determine which is less hindered.\n        *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and another C from the methyl group).\n        *   C6 is not substituted with a methyl group; it's bonded to C1, C5, O, and an H atom, making it a secondary carbon.\n        *   According to the rule, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n    *   **Product Structure:** Since the attack is at C6, the epoxide's C6-O bond breaks, and a new C6-Me bond is formed. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (which is implied in such reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product is therefore a cyclohexanol. The methyl groups will be at positions corresponding to the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added methyl at C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product's IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry**\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:** The main functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) will be designated as C1 in the product's name. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   The original molecule has methyls at C1, C3, C4. The new methyl is added at C6.\n        *   Numbering the product ring counter-clockwise from the OH-bearing carbon (old C1):\n            *   New C1 = Old C1 (has a Me)\n            *   New C2 = Old C6 (has the new Me)\n            *   New C3 = Old C5\n            *   New C4 = Old C4 (has a Me)\n            *   New C5 = Old C3 (has a Me)\n            *   New C6 = Old C2\n        *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethyl) that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We now determine the stereochemistry of the chiral centers in the product (C1, C2, C4, C5). We use the second rule provided: inversion at the point of attack and retention at other centers.\n        *   **At C1:** This center is not attacked directly. The C1-O bond breaks on the oxygen side, not at the stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration at C1 is retained. The original configuration is (1R), so the product will be **(1R)**.\n        *   **At C2 (from old C6):** This is the site of nucleophilic attack. The rule states that inversion of configuration occurs. The original configuration at C6 was (6S). Inversion of (S) gives (R). So, the new C2 center will be **(2R)**.\n        *   **At C4 (from old C4):** This center is remote from the reaction site and its configuration is retained. Original is (4R), so the product is **(4R)**.\n        *   **At C5 (from old C3):** This center is also remote and its configuration is retained. Original is (3R), so the product will be **(5R)**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Product Name**\n    *   Combining the name and stereochemistry, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options**\n    *   The derived product name and stereochemistry match option C exactly.\n\n    *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\n    *   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern)\n    *   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Correct)\n    *   D) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern)\n\n<<<C>>>"
