    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that produces a transit signal with the same amplitude as the brightness variation of a rotating spotted star.\n\n2.  **Model the Spotted Star's Brightness Variation:**\n    *   The variation in brightness is caused by the star's rotation, which brings a spotted hemisphere and an unspotted hemisphere into view periodically.\n    *   The maximum brightness (or flux, `F_max`) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer.\n    *   The minimum brightness (`F_min`) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing the observer.\n    *   The brightness of a star is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy per unit area per unit time) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T^4`).\n    *   Let `T_eff` be the effective temperature of the star's photosphere (6000 K) and `T_spot` be the temperature of the dark spots.\n    *   The problem gives a temperature difference `ΔT = 1000 K`, so `T_spot = T_eff - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Flux for Both Hemispheres:**\n    *   For simplicity, we can consider the projected disk of the star. Let's assume the constants of proportionality (like the star's projected area `A` and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant `σ`) are the same in both cases, so we can work with relative fluxes.\n    *   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** When the unspotted hemisphere faces us, the entire disk radiates at `T_eff`.\n        `F_max ∝ T_eff^4`\n    *   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction of the disk is covered by cooler spots. The filling factor `f_spot` is 20% (or 0.20). This means 20% of the projected area radiates at `T_spot`, and the remaining 80% (or 1 - `f_spot`) radiates at `T_eff`.\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff^4 + f_spot * T_spot^4`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Signal:**\n    *   The amplitude of the photometric variation is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `F_max` and `F_min`:\n        `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff^4 + f_spot * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4]`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n        `Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n        `Amplitude = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    *   An exoplanet transit causes a dip in the star's brightness. For a spherical planet transiting a spherical star (without considering effects like limb darkening), the depth of the transit (the amplitude of the signal) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n6.  **Equate the two scenarios and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the amplitude from the spotted star is equal to the transit depth of the hypothetical planet.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4])`\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values:\n        `f_spot = 0.20`\n        `T_eff = 6000 K`\n        `T_spot = 5000 K`\n    *   We will use a short Python script to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters from the problem\nf_spot = 0.20   # Spot filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Star's effective temperature in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Spot temperature in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to starspots\n# Amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of a planet is given by (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spotted star\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.3218, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks us to equate two different physical scenarios that produce the same observational effect: a dip in a star's brightness.\n\n**Scenario 1: Rotational Modulation due to Starspots**\n\n1.  The star has two distinct hemispheres: one \"clean\" and one partially covered by spots. The maximum brightness occurs when the clean hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n2.  We can model the flux (brightness) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the emitted flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n3.  Let `F_max` be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. For a unit area, this is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n4.  Let `F_min` be the flux when the spotted hemisphere faces us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot` (20% or 0.2) covered by cool spots at `T_spot` and the remaining fraction `(1 - f_spot)` at the star's normal temperature `T_eff`. So, `F_min` is proportional to `(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n5.  The amplitude of the signal due to the spots is the relative drop in flux:\n    `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    `Amplitude_spot = 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n    `Amplitude_spot = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n    `Amplitude_spot = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n**Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit**\n\n1.  An exoplanet passing in front of its star blocks a portion of the star's light.\n2.  The depth of this transit signal (the amplitude of the brightness drop) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    `Amplitude_transit = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**Equating the Amplitudes**\n\nThe problem states that the signal from the spots is the same as the signal from the hypothetical planet.\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴])`\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `f_spot = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Temperature difference = 1000 K, so `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴])`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴])`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - 0.48225])`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * 0.51775)`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
