    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Phenotypes of Single Mutants\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the single-mutant plants. The wild-type (WT) resistance is the control at 100%.\n\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** Knocking out the G1 gene reduces resistance from 100% to 75%. This is a 25% loss. So, G1 contributes to resistance, but it's not the most critical of the three.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** Knocking out the G2 gene completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for the resistance pathway. Its function is not redundant and is absolutely required.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** Knocking out the G3 gene reduces resistance from 100% to 50%. This is a 50% loss. G3 is a significant contributor to resistance, more so than G1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Gene Interactions (Epistasis)\nEpistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant (e.g., `gXgY`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (e.g., `gX`). This usually implies that the epistatic gene (G_X) acts upstream of the other gene (G_Y) in the same biological pathway.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant (0% resistance):** The resistance level of `g1g2` is 0%. This is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype (0%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1.\n*   **g2g3 double mutant (0% resistance):** The resistance level of `g2g3` is 0%. This is also identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype (0%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3.\n\n### 3. Synthesize the Role of G2\nSince G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, it is the most likely candidate for the upstream regulator. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. The data strongly supports the conclusion that **G2 is this transcription factor**, which activates or is required for the function of both G1 and G3. A plausible pathway model is that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both dependent on G2.\n\n```\n      --> G1 --|\nG2 --|          |--> Resistance\n      --> G3 --|\n```\n\nThis conclusion immediately eliminates option C, which claims G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n### 4. Analyze the g1g3 Double Mutant\nNow let's examine the interaction between G1 and G3.\n\n*   `g1` resistance = 75% (25% loss from WT)\n*   `g3` resistance = 50% (50% loss from WT)\n*   `g1g3` resistance = 10% (90% loss from WT)\n\nIf the genes acted independently in separate pathways, the expected loss of resistance in the double mutant would be the sum of individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75% loss. This would result in 25% resistance. However, the actual resistance is 10%, which is much lower. This type of interaction, where the double mutant has a more severe phenotype than the additive effects of the single mutants, is called **synergy** or synthetic enhancement.\n\nThis observation allows us to evaluate the middle clause of the remaining options (A, B, D).\n*   **A) G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** Gene redundancy implies that the genes have a similar function, so losing one has a mild effect while losing both has a severe effect. While the double mutant is severe, the single mutants (especially g3) also have strong phenotypes. However, \"partial redundancy\" is often used to describe parallel pathways that can compensate for each other to some degree. This is a plausible, though imprecise, description.\n*   **B) G1 and G3 has the same promoter:** This is a specific molecular hypothesis about how G2 regulates them. While plausible, it cannot be directly concluded from the phenotypic data alone.\n*   **D) G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple distinct traits. Here, multiple genes are affecting a single trait (resistance). This is an incorrect use of the term.\n\nComparing these, \"gene redundancy\" (interpreted as partial redundancy in parallel pathways) is the most fitting functional description among the choices for the synergistic interaction observed.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Final Clause (Epistasis between G1 and G3)\nAll the remaining options make a claim about epistasis between G1 and G3.\n*   **A and D claim:** `G1 is epistatic towards G3`. This would mean the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is false.\n*   **B claims:** `G3 is epistatic towards G1`. This would mean the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also false.\n\nThere is no classical epistasis between G1 and G3 because the double mutant produces a novel, more severe phenotype. This indicates that this part of all the options is factually incorrect based on the data. The question is likely flawed in this regard.\n\n### 6. Conclusion: Choosing the Best-Fit Option\nWe must choose the best option despite the flaws.\n*   We have confidently established that **G2 is a transcription factor**. (A, B, D are possible).\n*   We have identified the G1-G3 interaction as **synergistic**. Of the descriptions offered, **gene redundancy** (Option A) is arguably the closest functional concept, representing parallel, partially compensating pathways. `Pleiotropy` (D) is incorrect terminology, and `same promoter` (B) is an unproven mechanistic guess.\n*   The final clause regarding epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect in all options.\n\nGiven this analysis, Option A contains one correct statement and one plausible (though imprecise) statement. Options B and D contain a correct statement but their second clauses are either an unprovable guess or terminologically incorrect. Therefore, Option A is the most likely intended answer.\n\n**A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n\n<<<A>>>"
