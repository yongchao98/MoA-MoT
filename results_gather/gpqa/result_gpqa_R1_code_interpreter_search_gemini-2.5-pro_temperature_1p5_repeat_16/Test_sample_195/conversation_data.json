    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\nWe are dealing with a harmonic oscillator, but the speeds can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the principles of special relativity. The key principle is the conservation of total energy.\n\n**2. Define the Total Energy in a Relativistic System**\nThe total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its rest energy ($E_0$), its relativistic kinetic energy ($K$), and its potential energy ($U$).\n\n*   Rest Energy: $E_0 = mc^2$\n*   Relativistic Kinetic Energy: $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   Total Relativistic Energy of a free particle is $E = E_0 + K = mc^2 + (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2$.\n*   Potential Energy for a harmonic oscillator (from Hooke's Law, $F=-kx$): $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nSo, the total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator at any point in its motion is:\n$E_{total} = (\\text{Rest Energy} + \\text{Kinetic Energy}) + \\text{Potential Energy}$\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n$E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy $E_{total}$ must be the same at all points during the oscillation. We can find the value of this constant energy by looking at a specific point. The most convenient point is the maximum displacement (amplitude), where the velocity is zero.\n\n*   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    This means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The potential energy is maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\nNow we have the constant total energy of the system.\n\n**4. Analyze the point of Maximum Speed**\nThe speed is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    The speed is maximum, so we denote it as $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n**5. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum displacement is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\nFirst, divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNext, invert both sides to isolate the square root term:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\nThe derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
