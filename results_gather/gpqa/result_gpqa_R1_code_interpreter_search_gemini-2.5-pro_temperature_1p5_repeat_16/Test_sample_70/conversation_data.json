    "This problem requires us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and having the same albedo (A is constant), the formula simplifies. The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:\n\nT_eq_i / T_eq_j = sqrt(a_j / a_i)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (T_eq ∝ 1/√a).\n\nSo, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, the ratio is:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star:\n\n(T_i / T_j)² = (a_i / a_j)³\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the orbital periods:\n\na_i / a_j = (T_i / T_j)^(2/3)\n\nApplying this to Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\na_2 / a_4 = (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) )\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (T_2 / T_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T_2 / T_4)^(1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods:\nT1 : T2 : T3 : T4 : T5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n\nFrom this, we get the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\nT_2 / T_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, plug this into our final equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (20 / 35)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the value:\n(4/7) ≈ 0.5714\n(0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
