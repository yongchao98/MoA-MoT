    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means there must be an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply selection rules to find the intermediate state:**\n    The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   Initial state has $n=3$. The intermediate state must have $n'<3$. A cascade typically proceeds to the next available energy level, so let's consider $n'=2$. The state $|n'=1, l'=1\\rangle$ is not possible since for $n=1$, only $l=0$ is allowed. Thus, the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. For the transition to $l'=1$, the selection rule $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state to be $m' = 0, +1, -1$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. All options provided in the question correctly identify the intermediate states as having the form $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   Initial intermediate state has $m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$. Final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0-m'$, which is $0$ (for $m'=0$), $-1$ (for $m'=1$), or $+1$ (for $m'=-1$). All these are allowed.\n        *   Since the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states can only decay to states with $n<2$ and $l=0$ or $l=2$, and $l=2$ is not possible for $n=1$, the only possible final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Thus, any atom reaching one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability 1.\n\n3.  **Determine the probability of each transition route:**\n    The probability of a particular cascade route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the ratio of the decay rate for that specific channel to the total decay rate from the initial state.\n\n    The decay rate for a spontaneous transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $A_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f | d_x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | d_y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | d_z | i \\rangle|^2$\n    where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We need to compare the transition rates from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states: $|f_1\\rangle = |2,1,1\\rangle$, $|f_2\\rangle = |2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|f_3\\rangle = |2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n    A key physical principle is that for a spherically symmetric system, the laws of physics must be rotationally invariant.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$).\n    *   The interaction Hamiltonian for spontaneous emission, when considering all possible outcomes (summing over photon polarizations and directions), is also spherically symmetric.\n    *   The three final states $|2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$ are basis states for the $l=1$ subspace. They are physically equivalent, related to each other by rotations.\n\n    Given the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, there can be no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of transitioning to any of the $m'$ sub-levels of the $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n\n    Total decay rate $A_{total} = A_{|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle} + A_{|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle} + A_{|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle}$.\n    Since the rates are equal, let $A_{|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle} = A$.\n    Then $A_{total} = A+A+A=3A$.\n\n    The probability (branching ratio) for any specific route, e.g., through $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P = \\frac{A_{|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A}{3A} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Matches our result)\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n\nThe calculation shows that the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
