    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of binary star system_1 (M1) to the total mass of binary star system_2 (M2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (M_total = m_a + m_b).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n        *   The system exhibits eclipses.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n        *   The system exhibits eclipses.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m_a + m_b) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K_a and K_b) by the following formula, which is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity:\n\n    M_total = [P * (K_a + K_b)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Eclipse Information:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial detail because an eclipsing system is viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i` ≈ 90°, `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and therefore `sin³(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n\n    M_total ≈ [P * (K_a + K_b)³] / (2πG)\n\n    This shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n    M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2. Using the proportionality derived above:\n\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\n    The constant term (1 / 2πG) cancels out in the ratio.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sums of the Velocity Amplitudes:**\n    *   For system_1: K_sum1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system_2: K_sum2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n7.  **Substitute the Values and Solve:** Now, plug the given periods and the calculated velocity sums into the ratio formula. Note that since we are taking a ratio, the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) will cancel out, so there is no need for conversion to SI units.\n\n    M1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to option B.\n\nTo verify the arithmetic, a simple calculation can be performed:\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1   # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocities for each system\nK_sum1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2)\n# M1/M2 = (P1 * K_sum1^3) / (P2 * K_sum2^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_sum1**3)) / (P2 * (K_sum2**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.432\n```\nThe calculation confirms the result. System 1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The total mass M of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by the formula:\nM = m₁ + m₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂ )³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. This implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination angle i is very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.\nThe formula for the total mass simplifies to:\nM ≈ [P * (K₁ + K₂ )³] / (2πG)\n\nThis shows that the total mass M is directly proportional to the period P and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂):\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂).\n\nFor system_1:\n*   P₁ = 2 years\n*   K₁a = 10 km/s\n*   K₁b = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = K₁a + K₁b = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\nFor system_2:\n*   P₂ = 1 year\n*   K₂a = 15 km/s\n*   K₂b = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = K₂a + K₂b = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow we can set up the ratio:\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁a + K₁b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂a + K₂b)³]\n\nSubstitute the values:\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
