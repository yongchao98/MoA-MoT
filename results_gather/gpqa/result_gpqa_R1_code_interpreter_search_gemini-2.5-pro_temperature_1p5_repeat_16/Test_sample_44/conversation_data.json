    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    *   We have four identical particles.\n    *   The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n    *   Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 * \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n    The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed in terms of E:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   ... and so on.\n\n3.  **Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin-up (↑) and spin-down (↓). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each unique quantum state (defined by `n` and the spin state) can only hold one particle. This means that each energy level `E_n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions (one with spin-up and one with spin-down).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels with the four particles, respecting the limit of two particles per level.\n    *   We place the first two particles in the n=1 level (E₁ = 1E). This level is now full.\n    *   We place the next two particles in the n=2 level (E₂ = 4E). This level is also now full.\n    The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n    $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n5.  **Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n    $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different ways of exciting the system from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excitation Energy = 15E (promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n    Let's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from a lower level (n=1) to the lowest empty level (n=3). The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n            Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n            Energy = $(1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n            Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3)$\n            Energy = $(2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n            Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4)$\n            Energy = $(2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n    Comparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second excited state is the one with energy 18E.\n    $E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    The energies of the three lowest states are:\n    *   Ground State: 10E\n    *   First Excited State: 15E\n    *   Second Excited State: 18E\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
