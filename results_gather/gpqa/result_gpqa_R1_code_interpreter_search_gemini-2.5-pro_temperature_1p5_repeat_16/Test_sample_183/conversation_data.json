    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substituents are on adjacent carbons, a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This arrangement can be challenging to synthesize due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each group is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's an *ortho, para* director and a weak activator. It is sterically bulky.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator. It's a precursor to the -OEt group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator. It's often used to control substitution patterns because it can be formed from a nitro group and converted into many other functional groups (like -OH, -OEt) via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: The protonated form of the amino group under acidic conditions. It's a *meta* director and a strong deactivator.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A *meta* director and a strong deactivator.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A *meta* director and a strong deactivator. It's often used as a reversible \"blocking group\" because it can be removed with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n*   **Option B and C**: These options contain chemically nonsensical steps.\n    *   **Option B**: `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization step that requires an amino (-NH2) group. In the sequence proposed, an amino group has not yet been formed by step iv.\n    *   **Option C**: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is a nitration step performed on a diazonium salt formed in step v. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates and are not typically subjected to nitration; they are used immediately to be replaced by another group.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form an anilinium-like complex (-NH3+AlCl3-). This complex is deactivating and a *meta*-director. Thus, alkylation will occur at the meta position, yielding **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline. Under strong acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu (at C3) directs to C2, C4, C5, C6.\n        *   The reinforcing position is C5. This would lead to a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, not the required 1,2,3 pattern.\n    *   Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    This option is the only one remaining. Let's analyze its feasibility. While it may have complexities, the other options are chemically incorrect. There must be a specific (perhaps non-obvious) pathway that makes A the correct answer. The synthesis likely relies on taking a minor isomer at some stage or a specific regiochemical outcome that is not immediately apparent.\n\n    Let's trace a plausible path based on the reagents in option A. A successful synthesis of a 1,2,3-pattern often involves starting with an ortho-substituted intermediate.\n    1.  i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces mainly the *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics, but also a smaller amount of the *ortho* isomer (**2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**). To achieve the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the minor ortho isomer. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" description in the prompt, which is a common issue in complex synthesis problems in a multiple-choice format. Let's assume we isolate and use this ortho isomer.\n    3.  Our intermediate is **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. (Let's number it with tBu at C2, NO2 at C1).\n    4.  iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (tBu at C2, NH2 at C1). Now we have the tert-butyl group and a precursor to the ethoxy group (-NH2 can be converted to -OH, then -OEt) in the correct ortho relationship.\n    5.  iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the key and most difficult step to rationalize. We need to introduce a nitro group at position 3. Position 3 is ortho to the amino group and meta to the tert-butyl group. Under the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group exists as the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The directing effects are conflicting. However, no other proposed sequence is viable. We must assume that for some specific reason (perhaps kinetic control, or an unstated condition), a sufficient amount of the **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** is formed.\n    6.  v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline to form a diazonium salt.\n    7.  vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to replace -N2+ with an -OH group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic proton is removed by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    9.  The final steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` seem extraneous as written in the sequence. They are the reagents for a blocking group strategy, which would have been useful earlier in the synthesis but serve no purpose at the end. Their presence suggests the question might be imperfectly constructed, but they don't invalidate the core transformation of steps i-vii.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Option A describes a sequence of valid reactions that, despite challenges with regioselectivity (particularly in steps ii and iv), represents the only plausible pathway among the choices to synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
