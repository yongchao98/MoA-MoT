    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin is described by the spin angular momentum operator `S`, with components `S_x`, `S_y`, and `S_z`.\n*   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `mu (= gamma*Sz)`, which is a slightly ambiguous notation. The standard physical definition is that the magnetic moment is a vector `μ = γS`. If we were to interpret `μ` as `γS_z * z_hat`, the subsequent interaction with a B-field in the Y-direction would be zero, leading to no oscillation. The problem states that oscillation occurs, so we must use the standard definition `μ = γS`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction). The particle is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = - (γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γBS_z`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB * (m_s * ħ)`, where `m_s` can be `+1/2` or `-1/2`.\n*   To be in the lowest energy state, if we assume `γ > 0`, the energy is minimized when `m_s` is maximized. So, `m_s = +1/2`. This corresponds to the spin-up state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field `B_final = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_final = - (γS) · (B * y_hat) = -γBS_y`.\n*   The state of the system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Since the new Hamiltonian is time-independent, the state at a later time `t` is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting `H` and `|ψ(0)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γBS_y)t/ħ) |+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z>`\n\n### 3. Physical Interpretation: Larmor Precession\n\n*   The operator `exp(iθS_n/ħ)` represents a rotation of the spin state by an angle `θ` around the axis defined by the unit vector `n`.\n*   In our case, the state evolves as `|ψ(t)> = exp(i(γB)t * S_y/ħ) |+z>`. This means the initial spin state `|+z>` is being rotated around the y-axis by an angle `θ(t) = γBt`.\n*   This physical phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, which initially points along the Z-axis, will precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n*   The angular frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`. By comparing `θ(t) = ω_L * t` with `θ(t) = γBt`, we can identify the Larmor frequency as `ω_L = γB`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Expectation Value\n\nWe need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n*   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ<S_z>(t)`.\n*   We can find `<S_z>(t)` by considering the classical picture of a precessing vector. The spin vector starts as `<s>_initial = (0, 0, ħ/2)`. It precesses in the x-z plane around the y-axis with angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n*   The z-component of the vector at time `t` will be `<S_z>(t) = |<s>| * cos(ωt) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n*   Therefore, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\n### 5. Determining the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The expression for `<μ_z>(t)` is a cosine function of time: `cos(γBt)`.\n*   The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(Ωt + φ)`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   By comparing our result `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n*   The options provided are in terms of `γB`, which confirms we are looking for the angular frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
