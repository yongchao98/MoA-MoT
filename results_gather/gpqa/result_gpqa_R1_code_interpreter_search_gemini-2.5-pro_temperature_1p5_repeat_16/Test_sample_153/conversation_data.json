    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This suggests the molecular weight of the compound (using the most abundant isotopes) is 156 amu.\n    *   There is an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to the 3:1 ratio characteristic of a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundances of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl, often found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift in the range of 10-13 ppm is definitive for the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid. Its integration (1H) and multiplicity (singlet, as it does not couple) confirm this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry equivalent to the two on the other, leading to this simple A₂B₂ (or more accurately AA'BB') splitting pattern.\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Putting it all together and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we have deduced that the unknown compound is a chlorobenzoic acid with the chlorine atom in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35.5) + (2 × 16) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. The nominal mass using ³⁵Cl is 156, and with ³⁷Cl it is 158. This matches the MS data.\n    *   Now, let's review the options:\n        *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Lacks the carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with IR and NMR.\n        *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR peak at 11.0 ppm.\n        *   C) **4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data (MS, IR, and the specific para-substitution pattern in the ¹H NMR).\n        *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is an ortho-substituted isomer. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets due to the lack of symmetry. It would show four distinct, coupled signals in the aromatic region.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
