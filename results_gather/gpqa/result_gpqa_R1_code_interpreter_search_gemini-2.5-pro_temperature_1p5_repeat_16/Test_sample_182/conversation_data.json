    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to understand its structure and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (Ï€) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of all these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD from it.\nThe structure is a C6 ring, a COOH group (1C), a CHO group (1C), and a vinyl group (2C). Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbons.\nLet's find the number of hydrogens. The molecular formula is C10H12O3.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 5 for the reactant.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristics are:\n*   It reduces carbonyl groups (from aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes (CH2 or CH3 groups).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (alkanes).\n*   It reduces alcohols to alkanes.\n*   Crucially, it does **not** break open stable aliphatic rings like cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The C=C double bond in the `cyclohexene` ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the `vinyl` group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group will be completely reduced.\n*   The C=O double bond in the `formyl` group will be completely reduced.\n\nEssentially, all pi bonds in the molecule are removed by the reduction. The carbon skeleton, including the six-membered ring, remains intact.\n\nThe product will be a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**.\n*   The number of rings in the product is 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The number of pi bonds in the product is 0 (since all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD (product) = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction with Red P / HI reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but leaves the ring structure intact. The initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 from the ring, 4 from various double bonds). The reaction removes all 4 double bonds, thus reducing the IHD by 4.\n\nFinal IHD = Initial IHD - (Number of pi bonds reduced)\nFinal IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane, which has one ring and no double bonds, giving it an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
