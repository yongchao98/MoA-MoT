    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem involves uncertainties in position and energy, which points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the relevant form of the Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relating position ($x$) and momentum ($p$) is:\n    $\\Delta x \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where:\n    *   $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction.\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s.\n\n3.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):** The problem asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we can use the equality:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\Delta x = 0.1 \\text{ nm} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s}$\n\n4.  **Relate the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):** The energy ($E$) of a particle is a function of its momentum ($p$). For small uncertainties, we can relate them using the derivative:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE}{dp} \\right| \\Delta p$\n\n5.  **Determine the correct energy-momentum relation:** The electron's speed is $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s, which is two-thirds the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s). This speed is relativistic, so we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n    where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n6.  **Calculate the derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}$:**\n    We differentiate the energy-momentum relation with respect to $p$:\n    $\\frac{d(E^2)}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp}((pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2)$\n    $2E \\frac{dE}{dp} = 2pc^2$\n    $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{pc^2}{E}$\n    From special relativity, we also know that $p = \\gamma m_0 v$ and $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. Dividing these two gives $\\frac{p}{E} = \\frac{v}{c^2}$.\n    Substituting this back into our expression for the derivative:\n    $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\left( \\frac{v}{c^2} \\right) c^2 = v$\n    This shows that the rate of change of energy with respect to momentum is simply the particle's velocity. This is a general result; the derivative $dE/dp$ is the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which equals its classical velocity.\n\n7.  **Calculate the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$):** Now we can use the simplified relation:\n    $\\Delta E = v \\cdot \\Delta p$\n    We have:\n    *   $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\Delta p = 5.27 \\times 10^{-25}$ kg·m/s\n    $\\Delta E = (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s})$\n    $\\Delta E = 10.54 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ J} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) ~$10^{-19}$ J\n    B) ~$10^{-17}$ J\n    C) ~$10^{-16}$ J\n    D) ~$10^{-18}$ J\n    The calculated value, $1.054 \\times 10^{-16}$ J, is very close to $10^{-16}$ J.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\nv = 2 * 10**8  # speed of electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1 * 1e-9  # uncertainty in position in meters (0.1 nm)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n# delta_x * delta_p >= hbar / 2\n# Minimum delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Relate uncertainty in energy (delta_E) to uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# The relation is delta_E = |dE/dp| * delta_p\n# For a relativistic particle, the derivative dE/dp is equal to the particle's velocity, v.\n# So, delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.2e} J\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The problem deals with uncertainties in position and energy, which falls under the domain of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the relevant Uncertainty Principle:** The principle connecting the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$).\n\n3.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):** The problem asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we use the equality:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    Given:\n    *   $\\Delta x = 0.1 \\text{ nm} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$\n    \n    Substituting the values:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{2 \\times (10^{-10} \\text{ m})} \\approx 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s}$\n\n4.  **Relate uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) to uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):** For small uncertainties, the relationship between the uncertainty in energy and momentum is given by:\n    $\\Delta E = \\left| \\frac{dE}{dp} \\right| \\Delta p$\n    \n    The term $dE/dp$ represents how energy changes with momentum. For a particle, this is equal to its velocity, $v$. This holds true for both classical and relativistic mechanics. Since the electron's speed ($v = 2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$) is a significant fraction of the speed of light, it is a relativistic particle, but the relationship $\\frac{dE}{dp} = v$ is still valid.\n    \n    Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n    $\\Delta E = v \\cdot \\Delta p$\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    Using the values we have:\n    *   $v = 2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $\\Delta p \\approx 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s}$\n    \n    $\\Delta E = (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg·m/s})$\n    $\\Delta E \\approx 10.54 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ J}$\n    $\\Delta E \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately $1.054 \\times 10^{-16}$ J, which is very close to $10^{-16}$ J.\n\n*   A) ~$10^{-19}$ J\n*   B) ~$10^{-17}$ J\n*   C) ~$10^{-16}$ J\n*   D) ~$10^{-18}$ J\n\nThe result matches option C. The Python code execution confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
