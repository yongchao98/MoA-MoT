    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct statement.\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Chemistry Problem:** The goal is to produce polyethylene with \"regular branches\" using only ethylene as a monomer. This requires a tandem catalysis system. One catalyst must first oligomerize ethylene into short alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene). A second catalyst must then copolymerize these in-situ generated alpha-olefins with the remaining ethylene. This process is used to make Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) or bimodal High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) in a single reactor.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement A:** \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"\n    *   **Periodic Table Groups:** In the standard CAS and old IUPAC notations, Group VIa refers to the chalcogens (Oxygen, Sulfur, Selenium, etc.). These are in Group 16 of the modern IUPAC system. They are not transition metals (with the exception of the radioactive metalloid polonium, which is irrelevant here).\n    *   **Relevant Catalysts:** The key industrial catalysts for selective ethylene oligomerization (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene) are based on Chromium (Cr). Chromium is in Group 6, which is designated as Group VIb in the older systems.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The statement is incorrect on two counts: it misidentifies the group (VIa instead of VIb), and it incorrectly labels Group VIa elements as transition metals. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement D:** \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"\n    *   **The \"Additional Step\":** This refers to the ethylene oligomerization reaction.\n    *   **Role of Activators:** Organometallic catalysts for both polymerization and oligomerization almost always require a co-catalyst or activator to generate the active species.\n    *   **Common Activators:** Aluminum-based compounds like triethylaluminum (TEA), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and methylaluminoxane (MAO) are the most common activators used in this type of chemistry.\n    *   **Industrial Example:** The highly successful Phillips ethylene trimerization process uses a chromium-based catalyst that is activated by triethylaluminum (TEA), an aluminum-based activator.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The statement that aluminum-based activators \"do not work\" is factually incorrect. They are often essential. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement C:** \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"\n    *   **Meaning of \"Combined Systems\":** This refers to the tandem catalysis approach described in step 1.\n    *   **Industrial Reality:** Several companies have commercialized this technology. Notable examples include Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil) with their PRODIGY™ catalysts for the UNIPOL™ process, and Chevron Phillips Chemical with their dual-catalyst systems. These technologies are used in large-scale plants, including in the US, to produce advanced grades of polyethylene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The statement is factually correct. Such systems are indeed a commercial reality in the US.\n\n5.  **Analyze Statement B:** \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"\n    *   **Noble Metals:** These are precious metals like platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, etc.\n    *   **Catalytic Activity:** Research has shown that catalysts based on certain noble metals, particularly iridium and palladium, are effective for ethylene oligomerization. For example, specific iridium pincer complexes show high activity.\n    *   **Economic Viability:** Noble metals are extremely expensive compared to base metals like chromium, titanium, or iron. For the production of a high-volume, relatively low-cost commodity chemical like polyethylene, the cost of a noble metal catalyst would be prohibitive, making it economically non-viable for industrial-scale production.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The statement is factually correct. The catalysts are technically usable (\"can be used\") but economically impractical (\"too expensive\") for this application.\n\n6.  **Resolve the Ambiguity:** Both statements B and C appear to be correct. In a single-choice question, there might be a subtle flaw in one of the statements or one might be considered \"more\" correct.\n    *   Let's re-examine the context. The scientist is starting with a *homogeneous* catalyst system. The most prominent large-scale industrial tandem systems (e.g., Univation's PRODIGY™) are *heterogeneous* (supported on silica). While tandem systems with homogeneous catalysts exist (e.g., in research from Dow), their large-scale implementation for bulk PE is less widespread. Therefore, one could argue that statement C, while generally true, might be an oversimplification or slightly inaccurate in the specific context of the scientist's homogeneous system. The word \"Such\" links the statement to the scientist's specific situation.\n    *   Statement B, on the other hand, is a general statement of fact about a class of potential catalysts. Its truth does not depend on the specifics of the scientist's setup (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous). It is a universally acknowledged fact in catalysis that while some noble metal catalysts are highly active, their cost precludes their use in bulk chemical manufacturing.\n    *   Given the potential for nuance and subtle inaccuracy in statement C depending on the interpretation of \"Such combined systems\", statement B stands as the most robust and unequivocally correct statement among the choices. It presents a clear, undisputed fact about an alternative technology path.\n\nFinal check confirms that A and D are definitively incorrect. Between B and C, both are largely true, but C has a potential subtle inaccuracy based on context, whereas B is a straightforward, unassailable fact.\n\n<<<B>>>"
