    "This problem requires a conceptual understanding of the mean free path and how it depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\n1.  **Definition of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target particle for a collision to occur.\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   In this case, the moving particles are gas molecules, and the target particles are other gas molecules.\n    *   The number density of gas molecules is `n_gas`.\n    *   The collision is a physical one, governed by short-range van der Waals forces. The collision cross-section, let's call it `σ_gas-gas`, is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules.\n    *   So, λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas).\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   Here, the moving particles are the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam.\n    *   The target particles are the same residual gas molecules as before. Therefore, their number density `n_gas` is the same as in the first scenario, since the vacuum conditions (pressure, temperature) have not changed.\n    *   The collision, however, is fundamentally different. It is an electrostatic interaction (scattering) between the charged electron and the electric field of the gas atom/molecule (composed of the positive nucleus and the negative electron cloud). This is a long-range Coulomb interaction.\n    *   An electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"scattered\" or \"collided\") even when passing at a considerable distance from the gas molecule, a distance much larger than the molecule's physical radius.\n    *   This means the effective area for an electron to interact with a gas molecule, `σ_electron-gas`, is much larger than the physical cross-section for two gas molecules to collide, `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   Therefore, we have `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`.\n    *   The mean free path for the electrons is λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas).\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n    *   λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas)\n\n    Since `n_gas` is the same in both equations and we have established that `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, we can compare the two expressions. Because the cross-section `σ` is in the denominator, a larger cross-section leads to a smaller mean free path.\n\n    Given `σ_electron-gas` > `σ_gas-gas`, it must be true that:\n    1 / (n_gas * σ_electron-gas) < 1 / (n_gas * σ_gas-gas)\n\n    Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe probability of an electron scattering off a residual gas molecule is much higher than the probability of two gas molecules colliding with each other. This is because the electron interacts via the long-range Coulomb force, giving the gas molecule a much larger effective collision cross-section from the electron's perspective. A higher collision probability (larger cross-section) means the average distance between collisions (the mean free path) is shorter. Thus, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1). This is a critical reason why an ultra-high vacuum is essential for electron microscopy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
