    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    This problem involves two inertial frames of reference, a scenario perfectly described by Special Relativity.\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference. In this frame, the observer is stationary, and the glass is moving with a velocity `v`.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass is at rest. The light beam is propagating through the glass.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the Glass Frame (S') relative to the Laboratory Frame (S):** This is given as `v`. Since the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer, we can consider this velocity to be positive. So, `v_{S'/S} = v`.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the Glass Frame (S'):** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured by an observer at rest with the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Since it propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is also positive.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the quantity we need to find, let's call it `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The Lorentz velocity addition formula relates the velocity of an object in two different inertial frames. The formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values from step 2 into the formula, remembering that `c=1`:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression for `u`.\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) `(1+n*v)/(n+v)` - This matches our result.\n    B) `(1-n*v)/(n+v)` - Incorrect.\n    C) `(1+n*v)/(n-v)` - Incorrect.\n    D) `1` - Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. This result is famously known as the Fizeau formula for the speed of light in a moving medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
