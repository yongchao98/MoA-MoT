The speed is `c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the lab (u):** This is the quantity we need to find.

The glass is moving with velocity `v`.\n*   **Frame S' (Glass):** The glass is at rest. The speed of light within the glass is `u'`.\n*   **Speed of light in the medium's rest frame (S'):** The index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). Given `c=1`, we have `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** For collinear motion, the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S, given the velocity `u'` in frame S' and the relative velocity `v` between the frames, is `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`. This formula is the correct one to use, as opposed to the simple classical addition of velocities.

Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\nWe need to consider two different inertial frames of reference:\n*   **S' (The Rest Frame of the Glass):** In this frame, the glass is stationary. An observer in this frame would be moving along with the glass.\n*   **S (The Laboratory Frame):** In this frame, the laboratory and the observer are stationary. The glass is observed to be moving with a constant velocity `v`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The definition of the index of refraction `n` of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n*   So, `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n*   This velocity `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam (`u`) as measured in the laboratory frame (S). To do this, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, as the speeds involved can be close to the speed of light. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate.\n*   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S', the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S', the glass) relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n\n*   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   We have the velocity of the glass `v`.\n*   We have the speed of light in vacuum `c = 1`.\n\nSubstituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\n*   First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n*   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + nv/n = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n*   Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n*   The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n**6.

The problem involves the speed of light, which is the domain of special relativity.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which speed belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab frame) is the key to setting up the problem correctly.\n*   **Sign Convention:** Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, both `u'` and `v` are positive. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would be negative.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final form. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by `n` is an efficient way to simplify.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass.

Determine the speed of light within the glass frame (S')**\nThe index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u_medium`).\n`n = c / u_medium`\nTherefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest within the glass is:\n`u_medium = c / n`\nSince the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass frame is:\n`u = 1/n`\n\n**3. Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula**\nThe formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n`u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v / c^2)`\nwhere:\n*   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n*   `u` is the velocity of the object as seen in the moving frame (S'). Here, `u = 1/n`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S). Here, `v` is the velocity of the glass.\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. Here, `c=1`.\n\n**4. Substitute the values and simplify**\nSubstitute `u = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n`u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n`u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u' = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u' = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n`u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.

We want to find the speed of light in this frame. Let's denote this speed by *u*.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S):** The glass is moving at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame S' with respect to frame S is *v*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the moving frame (S'):** In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, *n*. The speed of light in a medium is given by *c/n*. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum *c=1*, the speed of the light beam as measured in the glass frame (S') is *u' = 1/n*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the laboratory frame (S):** This is the unknown quantity we need to find, which we have denoted as *u*.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    In classical physics (Galilean relativity), we would simply add the velocities: *u = u' + v = 1/n + v*. However, for speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's theory of special relativity. The correct formula is the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)*\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   *u'* = 1/n (speed of light in the glass's rest frame)\n    *   *v* = v (speed of the glass relative to the lab)\n    *   *c* = 1 (speed of light in vacuum)\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )*\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )*\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by *n*. Let's use the latter method as it's more direct.\n\n    *u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * ( 1 + v/n ) )*\n\n    Distribute *n* in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v\n    *   Denominator: n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v\n\n    So, the simplified expression for *u* is:\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativity is Key:** The problem involves speeds that can be a significant fraction of the speed of light (since light is involved), so relativistic effects cannot be ignored. Using the Galilean addition *u = u' + v* would be incorrect.\n*   **Speed of Light in a Medium:** A common mistake is to assume the speed of light is always *c* (or 1 in this case). The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light *in a vacuum* is *c* for all inertial observers. The speed of light *in a medium* is *c/n* only in the rest frame of that medium.\n*   **Frame Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify which velocity belongs to which frame of reference. *u'* is the speed in the moving frame (S'), and *u* is the speed in the stationary lab frame (S).\n*   **Direction of Motion:** The problem states that the glass and the light beam move in the *same direction*. This is why we use the '+' sign in the numerator of the velocity addition formula, *(u' + v)*. If they were in opposite directions, we would use a '-' sign.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n1.  Speed of light in the rest frame of the glass: *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n2.  Speed of the glass in the lab frame: *v*.\n3.  Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula: *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)*.\n4.  Substitute values: *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v)*.\n5.  Simplify by multiplying numerator and denominator by *n*: *u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)*.\n6.  This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, which we'll call **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, which we'll call **S'**. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is given as **v**.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in a medium at rest with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. In the S' frame (where the glass is at rest), the speed of the light beam is **u' = c/n**. The problem states that `c=1`, so **u' = 1/n**. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, `u'` is positive.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds that can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute the values we have into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression for `u`:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem requires the application of Einstein's velocity-addition formula.

According to the definition of the index of refraction (*n*), this speed is *u' = c/n*.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, as 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass, is *u' = 1/n*.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)*\n    Here, *u* is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   *u'* = 1/n\n    *   *v* = v\n    *   *c* = 1\n\n    This gives:\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, multiply both by *n*:\n    *u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)*\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, which provided a theoretical explanation for the results of the Fizeau experiment using special relativity. The Fizeau experiment, conducted in 1851, was a key piece of evidence that shaped Einstein's thinking on the matter. The relativistic velocity-addition formula is a cornerstone of special relativity, ensuring that the speed of an object as measured by different observers is consistent with the postulate that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers.\n\nComparing the derived result with the given options:\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe user is asking for the speed of light in a moving medium relative to a stationary observer.

Since `c=1`, `u' = 1/n`.\n2.  **Frame of the laboratory (S):** In this frame, the observer is at rest. The glass is moving with velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam.\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition:** The formula to find the velocity `u` in the laboratory frame (S) is given by:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitution:** Substitute the known values (`u' = 1/n`, `v`, and `c = 1`) into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplification:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   C) 1\n    *   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed `u` matches option D. This result is a known consequence of special relativity and is related to the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic confirms the result. The application of the relativistic velocity addition formula is the correct approach for this problem. The speed of light in a medium is relative to the medium itself (`c/n`), and when the medium is moving, the observer in the laboratory must use velocity addition to find the observed speed.\n\nThe final derived expression is `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

First, simplify the denominator:\n    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)\n\n2.  To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by **n**:\n    u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)\n\n3.

Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S')**\n\n*   The index of refraction, `n`, of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`). This speed `u'` is measured in the rest frame of the medium itself.\n*   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   So, the formula becomes `n = 1 / u'`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass (in Frame S') is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, we'll consider this velocity to be positive.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S). This requires transforming the velocity `u'` from Frame S' to Frame S.\n*   The relativistic velocity addition formula is used for this purpose.

It is not the speed relative to the lab observer.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Galilean Addition:** Because the problem involves the speed of light, the Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) is incorrect. The relativistic formula must be used.\n*   **Signs of velocities:** The problem states the glass and the light beam move in the \"same direction\". This means `u'` and `v` have the same sign, leading to the `(u' + v)` term in the velocity addition formula's numerator.\n*   **Substitution of c=1:** Remember to use `c=1` as stated in the problem, which simplifies the relativistic formula.\n*   **Algebraic simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction to avoid errors.

This matches option D.\n\n    *   A) 1\n    *   B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe user wants to find the speed of light in a moving glass as observed from a laboratory frame.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the physics involved:\n1.  **Speed of light in the medium (glass):** In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is `u' = c / n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed is `u' = 1/n`.\n2.  **Velocity of the medium:** The glass is moving with a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam.\n3.  **Relativistic velocity addition:** Since the speeds can be significant compared to the speed of light, we must use the relativistic formula for velocity addition. The formula for combining two velocities, `u'` and `v`, that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n4.  **Applying the formula:**\n    *   `u` is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `u' = 1/n` is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself.\n    *   `v` is the speed of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n    *   `c = 1` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n    Substituting these values into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the expression:**\n    To get rid of the fraction in the numerator and denominator, I can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = (n * (1/n + v)) / (n * (1 + v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the options:**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n    *   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v) - Incorrect sign in the numerator.\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v) - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v) - Correct.\n    *   D) 1 - Incorrect. The speed would only be 1 (or `c`) in a vacuum, not in a moving medium.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity and is related to the Fizeau experiment, which first measured the speed of light in moving water. The formula shows that the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speed in the medium and the medium's velocity.To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame S.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame S'. The velocity of S' relative to S is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass (in the rest frame of the glass, S') is `u'`. According to the definition of the index of refraction `n`, this speed is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` should be taken as 1. Therefore, `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    When the velocities are in the same direction, the formula for adding velocity `u'` (of the light in the glass) and `v` (of the glass itself) is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = (n * (1/n + v)) / (n * (1 + v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option C. This phenomenon is known as the Fresnel drag effect, which was experimentally confirmed by the Fizeau experiment and later explained by Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem can be solved using the relativistic velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is the step-by-step plan to derive the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two main frames of reference:\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame, which is considered stationary.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference of the moving glass. It moves with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass (frame S') with respect to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the light beam with respect to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** The formula to find the resultant velocity `u` in the laboratory frame (S) when adding two velocities (`v` and `u'`) is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:** We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The derived expression for the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.

Understand the Setup**\n*   We have two frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S:** The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **Frame S':** The rest frame of the glass.\n*   Frame S' (the glass) is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to Frame S (the lab).\n*   A light beam is traveling through the glass.\n*   The velocity of the glass `v` is in the same direction as the propagation of the light beam.\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is given as `c = 1`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (Frame S')**\n*   The index of refraction, `n`, of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n*   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n*   This definition applies to the medium's own rest frame (Frame S').\n*   Given that `c = 1`, the formula becomes `n = 1 / u'`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured within the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n*   To find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (Frame S), we must use the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities. The simple Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not correct for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n*   The relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in Frame S (the lab frame). This is the value we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in Frame S' (the glass frame).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of Frame S' (the glass) relative to Frame S (the lab).\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n*   We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v` (the velocity of the glass)\n    *   `c = 1`\n*   Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n*   The expression simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n*   To make this expression look like the options provided, we can clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator by multiplying both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n*   Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n*   This simplifies to:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n*   The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n*   This matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to correctly identify the two frames of reference and the velocities relative to each. `u'` is the speed in the moving frame (the glass), while `u` is the speed in the stationary frame (the lab).\n*   **Definition of Index of Refraction:** Remember that `n = c/u'` is defined in the rest frame of the medium.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Galilean Addition:** This problem involves light, so relativistic effects are significant. The Galilean addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would be an incorrect approximation.\n*   **Signs of Velocities:** Both the light beam (in the glass) and the glass itself are moving in the same direction towards the observer. Therefore, `u'` and `v` are both positive in the standard formula.\n*   **`c = 1`:** The simplification `c=1` is a common convention in relativity problems to make the algebra cleaner. Don't forget to use `c^2 = 1^2 = 1` in the denominator of the velocity addition formula.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis: The derived formula `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` is the correct speed of light in the moving glass as seen by the lab observer.

Understand the physical setup**\nThis problem involves the addition of velocities in the framework of special relativity.

We want to find the speed of light in this frame. Let's denote this speed by *u*.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S):** The glass is moving at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame S' with respect to frame S is *v*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the moving frame (S'):** In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is determined by the index of refraction, *n*. The speed of light in a medium is given by *c/n*. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum *c=1*, the speed of the light beam as measured in the glass frame (S') is *u' = 1/n*.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam in the laboratory frame (S):** This is the unknown quantity we need to find, which we have denoted as *u*.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    In classical physics (Galilean relativity), we would simply add the velocities: *u = u' + v = 1/n + v*. However, for speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use Einstein's theory of special relativity. The correct formula is the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)*\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   *u'* = 1/n (speed of light in the glass's rest frame)\n    *   *v* = v (speed of the glass relative to the lab)\n    *   *c* = 1 (speed of light in vacuum)\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )*\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )*\n\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by *n*. Let's use the latter method as it's more direct.\n\n    *u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * ( 1 + v/n ) )*\n\n    Distribute *n* in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v\n    *   Denominator: n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v\n\n    So, the simplified expression for *u* is:\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativity is Key:** The problem involves speeds that can be a significant fraction of the speed of light (since light is involved), so relativistic effects cannot be ignored. Using the Galilean addition *u = u' + v* would be incorrect.\n*   **Speed of Light in a Medium:** A common mistake is to assume the speed of light is always *c* (or 1 in this case). The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light *in a vacuum* is *c* for all inertial observers. The speed of light *in a medium* is *c/n* only in the rest frame of that medium.\n*   **Frame Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify which velocity belongs to which frame of reference. *u'* is the speed in the moving frame (S'), and *u* is the speed in the stationary lab frame (S).\n*   **Direction of Motion:** The problem states that the glass and the light beam move in the *same direction*. This is why we use the '+' sign in the numerator of the velocity addition formula, *(u' + v)*. If they were in opposite directions, we would use a '-' sign.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n1.  Speed of light in the rest frame of the glass: *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n2.

This speed `u'` is measured in the rest frame of the medium itself.\n*   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n*   The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n*   So, the formula becomes `n = 1 / u'`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the glass (in Frame S') is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, we'll consider this velocity to be positive.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S).

Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed is `u' = 1/n`.\n2.  **Velocity of the medium:** The glass is moving with a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam.\n3.  **Relativistic velocity addition:** Since the speeds can be significant compared to the speed of light, we must use the relativistic formula for velocity addition. The formula for combining two velocities, `u'` and `v`, that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n4.  **Applying the formula:**\n    *   `u` is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `u' = 1/n` is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself.\n    *   `v` is the speed of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n    *   `c = 1` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n    Substituting these values into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the expression:**\n    To get rid of the fraction in the numerator and denominator, I can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = (n * (1/n + v)) / (n * (1 + v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the options:**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n    *   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v) - Incorrect sign in the numerator.\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v) - Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n+v) - Correct.\n    *   D) 1 - Incorrect. The speed would only be 1 (or `c`) in a vacuum, not in a moving medium.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity and is related to the Fizeau experiment, which first measured the speed of light in moving water. The formula shows that the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speed in the medium and the medium's velocity.To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame S.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame S'. The velocity of S' relative to S is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass (in the rest frame of the glass, S') is `u'`. According to the definition of the index of refraction `n`, this speed is `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` should be taken as 1. Therefore, `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    When the velocities are in the same direction, the formula for adding velocity `u'` (of the light in the glass) and `v` (of the glass itself) is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = (n * (1/n + v)) / (n * (1 + v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option C. This phenomenon is known as the Fresnel drag effect, which was experimentally confirmed by the Fizeau experiment and later explained by Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem can be solved using the relativistic velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity.

The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** The formula to find the resultant velocity `u` in the laboratory frame (S) when adding two velocities (`v` and `u'`) is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:** We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The derived expression for the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.

Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (Frame S')**\n*   The index of refraction, `n`, of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n*   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n*   This definition applies to the medium's own rest frame (Frame S').\n*   Given that `c = 1`, the formula becomes `n = 1 / u'`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured within the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n*   To find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (Frame S), we must use the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities. The simple Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not correct for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n*   The relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in Frame S (the lab frame).

The Galilean addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would be an incorrect approximation.\n*   **Signs of Velocities:** Both the light beam (in the glass) and the glass itself are moving in the same direction towards the observer. Therefore, `u'` and `v` are both positive in the standard formula.\n*   **`c = 1`:** The simplification `c=1` is a common convention in relativity problems to make the algebra cleaner. Don't forget to use `c^2 = 1^2 = 1` in the denominator of the velocity addition formula.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis: The derived formula `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` is the correct speed of light in the moving glass as seen by the lab observer.
