According to the Born interpretation, the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², gives the probability density of finding the particle at a certain position x. Since the particle must exist somewhere, the integral of this probability density over all possible space must be equal to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n|ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nWe are told that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density function from x=1 to x=3 and set the result to 1.\n\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFirst, we solve the first integral:\na² ∫¹³ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² [ln(1 + x)]¹³\n= a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² (ln(4) - ln(2))\n= a² ln(4/2)\n= a² ln(2)\n\nNext, we solve the second integral:\n∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 0.25 [x]¹³\n= 0.25 (3 - 1)\n= 0.25 * 2\n= 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the normalization equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSolving for \"a\":\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, we can calculate \"a\":\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The Born rule states that the probability of finding a particle in a specific region is the integral of the square of the modulus of its wave function over that region. Since the particle is guaranteed to be found between x=1 and x=3, the total probability in this interval must be 1.\n\nFirst, we define the wave function, Ψ(x), and its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x):\n*   Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n*   Ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i\n\nNext, we calculate the probability density function, which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate, |Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x)Ψ(x).\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * (-1)\n*   |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over the entire space where the particle can exist equals 1. In this case, the interval is.\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n*   ∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n*   The antiderivative is a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x.\n\nWe evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n*   [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ]\n*   [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ]\n*   a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n*   Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), we get:\n*   a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nNow, we set this result equal to 1 to solve for \"a\":\n*   a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n*   a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n*   a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n*   a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2) ≈ 0.693):\n*   a ≈ sqrt( 0.5 / 0.693 )\n*   a ≈ sqrt( 0.7215 )\n*   a ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo find the value of the constant \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function.

The total probability is the integral of this probability density over the entire space where the particle can be found.\n\n1.  **Write down the wave function:**\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability density, |ψ(x)|²:**\n    The wave function is a complex number of the form z = Re + i*Im. The modulus squared is |z|² = (Re)² + (Im)².\n    In our case:\n    *   Real part, Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    *   Imaginary part, Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\n    So, the probability density is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Set up the normalization integral:**\n    The problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density from 1 to 3, and this integral must equal 1.\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n4.  **Solve the integral:**\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **First part:**\n        a² * ∫[from 1 to 3] ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n        = a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n        = a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n        = a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n        Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        = a² * ln(4/2)\n        = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Second part:**\n        ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx\n        = [ 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3\n        = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n        = 0.25 * 2\n        = 0.5\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    Now, substitute the results back into the normalization equation:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    Using the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\n    a² ≈ 0.7215\n    a = sqrt(0.7215)\n    a ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the value of \"a\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The fundamental principle we need to use is the **normalization condition** of a wave function in quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    The integral is taken over all space.\n\n2.  **Define the Integration Limits:** The problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means the wave function ψ(x) is zero everywhere else. Therefore, our integration limits are from 1 to 3. The normalization condition becomes:\n    ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²:**\n    The wave function is given as a complex function:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n    The probability density, |ψ(x)|², is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate, ψ*(x). To find the complex conjugate, we replace 'i' with '-i':\n    ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n    Now, we multiply them:\n    |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n    |ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\n    This is in the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B².\n    Here, A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and B = 0.5*i.\n    |ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\n    Since i² = -1:\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n4.  **Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral:**\n    Now we substitute the expression for |ψ(x)|² into our normalization integral:\n    ∫₁³ ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫₁³ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **Part 1: Integrate the first term.**\n        Since 'a²' is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n        a² ∫₁³ ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n        The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n        a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n        = a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n        = a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n        Using the logarithm rule ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Part 2: Integrate the second term.**\n        ∫₁³ 0.25 dx\n        = [ 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3\n        = (0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1)\n        = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    Now, we combine the results of the two parts and set the sum equal to 1:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n    Isolate the term with a²:\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n    Solve for a²:\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    Using the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\n    a² ≈ 0.7213\n\n    Finally, take the square root to find \"a\" (we take the positive root by convention):\n    a = sqrt(0.7213)\n    a ≈ 0.8493\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value a ≈ 0.8493 is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The information about the \"large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems\" is extra information. The normalization constant 'a' is a property of the wave function for a single particle and does not depend on the number of systems.\n*   A common mistake is to calculate ψ(x)² instead of |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x)ψ(x). Since the wave function is complex, this distinction is crucial.\n*   The limits of integration are explicitly defined by the physical constraint that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3.\n*   Remember the basic rules of integration and logarithms to solve the definite integral correctly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem requires us to find the value of the constant \"a\" in the given wave function.
