What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 25.6%\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nUsing the given overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nN = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe search results confirm the methodology used. Specifically, result describes the formula for the fraction of a particular metal-ligand species (Φi). It states: Φi = 𝛽i[L]i / (1 + 𝛽1[L] + 𝛽2[L]2 + ...). This is the exact formula I used.\n\nResult also addresses the approximation I considered: \"When the total concentration of the ligand is much higher than that of the metal ion, i.e., CL >> CM ... the total ligand concentration can be used instead of the free ligand concentration.\" In this problem, the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), which justifies using [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M as a reasonable approximation for a multiple-choice question.\n\nThe calculation was:\n1.  Define the fraction of the target species, [Co(SCN)₂], as α₂.\n2.  The formula for this fraction is α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴).\n3.  Substitute the given values: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n4.  Calculate the denominator: 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n5.  Calculate the numerator: 40 * 0.1² = 0.4.\n6.  Calculate the fraction: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916.\n7.  Convert to percentage: 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%.\n\nThe calculation is robust and the underlying chemical principles are sound. The result directly corresponds to one of the options.\n\nFinal check of the question and my interpretation:\n- \"total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M\"\n- \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\n- \"stability constants ... β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16\"\n- \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\" - this corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂].\n\nEverything seems correct. I am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we can use the principles of chemical equilibrium and the definition of overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the thiocyanato complexes formed in the solution:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βₙ):\n*   [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex relative to the total cobalt concentration is given by:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term can be factored out and canceled, simplifying the equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in significant excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] with the given total concentration of 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the value of the numerator, which corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n**1. Identify the species in solution**\nThe total cobalt in the solution is distributed among several species due to complex formation with thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The species are:\n*   Free cobalt(II) ion: Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the overall stability constants (β)**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β_n).\n\nThe formation reactions and stability constants are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;     β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nFrom these definitions, we can write the concentration of each complex:\n[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Express the total cobalt concentration**\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nFactor out the [Co²⁺] term:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex**\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co):\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the given values and calculate**\nWe are given:\n[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\nβ₁ = 9\nβ₂ = 40\nβ₃ = 63\nβ₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression. Let's denote the denominator as Φ (the complex formation function).\n*   Numerator term: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the terms in the denominator:\nΦ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Φ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert the fraction to a percentage**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option D. Note that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, was not needed for this calculation because the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] was given directly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a solution containing Cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`).\n*   These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n*   The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex), relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall Stability Constants (β):\n    *   `β₁ = 9` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃ = 63` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄ = 16` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define the Species in Solution**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Complex Concentrations using Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Expression for the Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n\n**7. Simplify the Expression**\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial simplification.\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n**8. Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n*   `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * L² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction and the percentage:\nFraction = `Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is approximately 16.9%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nThe species in solution are the free `Co²⁺` ion and the complexes formed with thiocyanate (`SCN⁻`):\n*   `Co²⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the species of interest)\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3.

Formulate the fraction of the target complex:**\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total metal concentration. We are interested in `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3, we get:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5.

The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand.

    "Based on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This percentage is equivalent to the mole fraction of the complex multiplied by 100.\n\n1.  **Identify Species and Define Total Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co²⁺` ion and all the complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand (`SCN⁻`):\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use the Mole Fraction Formula**: The fraction of any specific complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]` (denoted as αₙ) can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The formula is derived by expressing each species' concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[L]`, which allows the `[Co²⁺]` term to be canceled out. For the target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Substitute Given Values**: We are given:\n    *   Ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n4.  **Calculate the Denominator**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative proportions of all cobalt species.\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n    Sum of denominator terms = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerator**: The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = **0.4**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Fraction and Percentage**:\n    *   Fraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately **16.9%**.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration**: The problem provides the thiocyanate concentration as `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since this is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 0.01 M`), it is a valid and standard approximation to use this value as the free equilibrium concentration of the ligand in the calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as the free metal ion concentration cancels out in the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Matching Result to Options**: The calculated value is 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 42.3%\n    B) 38.1%\n    C) 16.9%\n    D) 25.6%\n    The result correctly matches option C. Several of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but then selected the wrong letter (e.g., D or B). The correct choice is C.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the correct calculations among the candidate answers is that the percentage is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"

I am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we can use the principles of chemical equilibrium and the definition of overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the thiocyanato complexes formed in the solution:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βₙ):\n*   [Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex relative to the total cobalt concentration is given by:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term can be factored out and canceled, simplifying the equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in significant excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] with the given total concentration of 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\nD = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the value of the numerator, which corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n**1.

Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first.

The formula for the mole fraction of the second complex (α₂) is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, we can calculate the terms in the equation:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the mole fraction formula. The numerator is the term for the second complex, and the denominator is the sum of all terms.\n\n*   Numerator = 0.4\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer:** The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This can be determined by calculating the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free Co(II) ions and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ] = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. The `[Co²⁺]` term will cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nMy proposed action is to substitute the given values into this formula and calculate the result. I do not need to perform a search.\n\n**Skeptic:** Your proposed formula is correct for this type of calculation. However, I have some points to consider:\n1.  The problem provides the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, which is not used in your formula. Could this value be important? It might imply that the consumption of the thiocyanate ligand by complex formation is significant, meaning the equilibrium concentration of `[SCN⁻]` is not the stated 0.1 M.\n2.  The notation `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` typically refers to the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand in the solution. If this is the case, your formula is correct, and the total cobalt concentration is extraneous information, possibly included to test understanding.\n3.  Let's assume the standard interpretation that `[SCN⁻]` is the equilibrium concentration. The calculation then depends entirely on the correct application of the formula and accurate arithmetic. A small error could lead to selecting the wrong multiple-choice option.\n\n**Decision:** The most standard and direct interpretation of the problem is that `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M` is the equilibrium concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand. In this scenario, the Proposer's formula is the correct path forward. The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species. The next and final action is to perform the calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the denominator (D) of the fraction:\nD = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex term:\nN = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²\nN = 40 * (0.1)²\nN = 0.4\n\nThe fraction (α₂) is N / D:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
