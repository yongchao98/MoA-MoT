To solve it, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, as simple Galilean addition is not valid for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two frames. The first is the stationary laboratory frame (S), where the observer is. The second is the moving frame (S'), which is the glass itself, moving at velocity `v` relative to the lab.\n2.  **Determine the Velocity of Light in the Moving Frame (S'):** The index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). The problem states `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer at rest with the glass is `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** The formula to find the velocity `u` in the lab frame (S) by combining the velocity of the moving frame `v` and the velocity within that frame `u'` is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:** We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To clear the fractions, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The derived expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` exactly matches option A.

Since the speeds can be significant fractions of the speed of light, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically the relativistic velocity addition formula. The classical Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) would be incorrect.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **S' (Glass Frame):** This is the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass. This frame moves with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Identify the Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **`v`**: This is the velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states it's moving at a constant velocity `v`.\n    *   **`u'`**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured within the glass's own rest frame (S'). The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem specifies that we should take `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    For motion along a single axis (collinear motion), the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values we identified into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    The final derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the options provided in the question:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** It is crucial to recognize that this is a relativity problem and not to use the simple classical addition of velocities.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which velocity belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab's frame) is essential for setting up the formula correctly.\n*   **Definition of Refractive Index:** Remember that `n = c/u'`, where `u'` is the speed of light *in the medium's rest frame*.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Care must be taken when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final answer. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is the most efficient method.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly derive the expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.

Since the speeds can be significant fractions of the speed of light, we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically the relativistic velocity addition formula. The classical Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`) would be incorrect.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **S' (Glass Frame):** This is the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass. This frame moves with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Identify the Velocities in Each Frame:**\n    *   **`v`**: This is the velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).

The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem specifies that we should take `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    For motion along a single axis (collinear motion), the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values we identified into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    The final derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the options provided in the question:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** It is crucial to recognize that this is a relativity problem and not to use the simple classical addition of velocities.\n*   **Frame Identification:** Correctly identifying which velocity belongs to which frame of reference (`u'` in the glass's frame, `v` for the glass's motion, `u` in the lab's frame) is essential for setting up the formula correctly.\n*   **Definition of Refractive Index:** Remember that `n = c/u'`, where `u'` is the speed of light *in the medium's rest frame*.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Care must be taken when simplifying the complex fraction to arrive at the final answer.
