This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a base to abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In the starting material, there are two different ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both abstraction pathways, even though the C-H bond is weaker and breaks faster than the C-D bond (due to the kinetic isotope effect).\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This creates an unsymmetrical intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This creates a symmetrical intermediate: **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the amino group position 1, the deuterium is now at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n        1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n        Pathway B yields one distinct product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Products**\n    By combining the products from all possible pathways, we find three unique organic molecules:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\n*   The majority of the provided answers (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) correctly reason that two benzyne intermediates are formed, leading to a total of three products.\n*   Some answers (e.g., 8, 13) contain flawed reasoning in the addition step, leading to an incorrect count of 2 products.\n*   Many of the answers that correctly deduce 3 products then select the wrong letter from the multiple-choice options. For example, Answer 1 correctly explains why there are 3 products but then selects <<<C>>>, which corresponds to 4 products.\n*   Answers 2 and 3 provide the correct reasoning and select the correct option, <<<D>>>, which corresponds to 3 products.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the reaction mechanism, the correct number of possible products is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe user wants me to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a well-known organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition mechanism via a benzyne intermediate. To determine the number of possible products, we must consider all possible reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). The base removes H⁺ from C6, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The base removes D⁺ from C2, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the solvent. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the C1 position, the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to a single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products. The fact that one pathway is faster than the other affects the relative yields of the products, but the question asks for the total number of *possible* products.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction. This corresponds to option A.\n\nMost of the candidate answers correctly identify the three products through sound chemical reasoning, although many have contradictions between their reasoning and the final letter choice they provide. The correct analysis consistently leads to three products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction mechanism through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the process step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (NaNH₂) is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution via a benzyne intermediate.\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation):** The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position ortho to the bromine. We need to identify all possible benzyne intermediates that can form.\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Product Formation):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) then attacks each benzyne intermediate. We need to identify all possible products from these addition reactions.\n4.  **Step 3: Count Products:** Count the total number of unique organic products formed from all possible pathways.\n5.  **Final Answer:** Match the count to the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n*   **Step 1: Benzyne Formation**\n    The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two positions ortho to the bromine: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D). The base can abstract from either position.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D⁺ from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n    *   Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product Formation**\n    The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks each intermediate. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond.\n        1.  Attack at C1: This leads to **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6: This leads to **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n    *   **Product from non-deuterated benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n        3.  Attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n        This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Count Products**\n    Combining all possible products, we have:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\n    There are a total of **3** unique organic products.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Answer**\n    The question asks for the number of possible products. Our analysis shows there are 3.\n    The options are: A) 3, B) 2, C) 4, D) 1.\n    The correct option is A.\n\n```python\n# This problem requires analyzing an elimination-addition reaction via benzyne intermediates.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the possible benzyne intermediates.\n# The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated when the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince there are two different abstractable atoms at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although this pathway is slower, it is still possible and must be considered when determining all possible products. The loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the solvent. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When numbering the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at the C3 position. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Pathway B (via non-deuterated benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.

NaNH₂ is an exceptionally strong base, and the amide ion (NH₂⁻) is also a potent nucleophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive, unstable intermediate called a **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: The Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base. It abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying all possible abstraction sites.** The starting material has two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n    *   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Considering all possible pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products. Therefore, we must consider the consequences of abstraction from both sites, even if one pathway is faster than the other.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This creates the first intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule. This creates the second intermediate: **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1:** Two distinct benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n**3. Step 2: The Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Recognizing unsymmetrical intermediates.** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. According to IUPAC naming conventions, the ring is numbered to give the principal functional group (-NH₂) the lowest possible number (C1). Therefore, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A yields two distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) followed by protonation leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n    *   Pathway B yields one distinct product.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion: Counting the Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways originating from the two benzyne intermediates, we find a total of three unique organic products:\n1.

To determine the number of possible products, we must consider all possible reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically favored (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). The base removes H⁺ from C6, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** Although slower, this pathway is still possible. The base removes D⁺ from C2, and Br⁻ is eliminated from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the solvent. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the C1 position, the deuterium is at C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to a single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we can identify three distinct organic products. The fact that one pathway is faster than the other affects the relative yields of the products, but the question asks for the total number of *possible* products.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction. This corresponds to option A.\n\nMost of the candidate answers correctly identify the three products through sound chemical reasoning, although many have contradictions between their reasoning and the final letter choice they provide. The correct analysis consistently leads to three products.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction mechanism through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the process step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (NaNH₂) is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution via a benzyne intermediate.\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Benzyne Formation):** The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position ortho to the bromine. We need to identify all possible benzyne intermediates that can form.\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Product Formation):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) then attacks each benzyne intermediate. We need to identify all possible products from these addition reactions.\n4.  **Step 3: Count Products:** Count the total number of unique organic products formed from all possible pathways.\n5.  **Final Answer:** Match the count to the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n*   **Step 1: Benzyne Formation**\n    The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two positions ortho to the bromine: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D). The base can abstract from either position.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D⁺ from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n    *   Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are possible.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product Formation**\n    The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks each intermediate. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond.\n        1.  Attack at C1: This leads to **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6: This leads to **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        This pathway yields **two** distinct products.\n    *   **Product from non-deuterated benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium.\n        3.  Attack at either C1 or C2 leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n        This pathway yields **one** distinct product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Count Products**\n    Combining all possible products, we have:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\n    There are a total of **3** unique organic products.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Answer**\n    The question asks for the number of possible products.

Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as a benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a base to abstract a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nBecause there are two different abstractable atoms (H and D) at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. Subsequently, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This pathway is kinetically favored due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This means this pathway produces the major intermediate, but the question asks for all *possible* products.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. The bromide ion (Br⁻) then leaves from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n*   **Addition to the Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and a deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile can attack either C1 or C6, leading to different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the solvent. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium atom at C2. To name this molecule by standard convention, the carbon with the principal functional group (-NH₂) is numbered C1. Therefore, the original C6 is now C1, and the original C2 (with the deuterium) is at position C3 relative to the new C1. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to the Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack of the nucleophile at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2), followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products. The kinetic isotope effect influences the *ratio* of these products, but all three are chemically possible.\n\nThe three possible products are:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**1.

This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated when the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n\nIn the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince there are two different abstractable atoms at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although this pathway is slower, it is still possible and must be considered when determining all possible products. The loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by the solvent. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When numbering the ring to give the amino group the lowest number (C1), the deuterium is at the C3 position. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Pathway B (via non-deuterated benzyne):**\n    This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n**4.

It abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions:\n        *   **Position C6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   This leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is slower than H-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond), but it is still a possible pathway. This elimination forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the strained triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond, leading to two different products.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When renumbered to give the amino group the lowest position (C1), the deuterium is at position C3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from Intermediate B (Benzyne):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the nucleophile at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2) followed by protonation leads to a single product.\n        1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The resulting product is **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
