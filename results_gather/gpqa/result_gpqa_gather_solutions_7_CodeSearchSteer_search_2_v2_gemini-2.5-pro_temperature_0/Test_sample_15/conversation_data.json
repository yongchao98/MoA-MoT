A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which generally means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer) of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion), making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each one for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. The naming conventions that specify a single stereoisomer (e.g., using R/S descriptors) imply we are considering a pure, non-racemic sample.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound has chiral centers and that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposing CH₂ group bisects the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, there are 3 optically active compounds in the list. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning its molecular structure is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. If a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition (unless it's a meso compound).\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer) of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration in this symmetrical molecule results in an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the double bond's position. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group). The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we have:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Analysis of each compound based on chirality rules.\n    # True means optically active, False means inactive.\n    compounds_status = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": False,  # Achiral (plane of symmetry)\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": True, # Chiral (specified enantiomer)\n        \"(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": False, # Achiral (meso compound)\n        \"(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\": True,  # Chiral (specified enantiomer)\n        \"(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\": True,           # Chiral (specified enantiomer)\n        \"(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\": False, # Achiral (plane of symmetry)\n        \"1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\": False   # Achiral (no chiral centers)\n    }\n\n    active_count = 0\n    active_compounds_list = []\n\n    for compound, is_active in compounds_status.items():\n        if is_active:\n            active_count += 1\n            active_compounds_list.append(compound)\n\n    print(\"The following compounds are optically active:\")\n    for name in active_compounds_list:\n        print(f\"- {name}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(f\"Total number of optically active compounds: {active_count}\")\n\n    # The options are A) 5, B) 3, C) 4, D) 2\n    # Our count is 3, which corresponds to option B.\n    final_choice = 'B'\n    print(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}, which corresponds to the number {active_count}.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis and print the result.\nsolve_optical_activity()\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The following compounds are optically active:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\n========================================\nTotal number of optically active compounds: 3\nThe correct option is B, which corresponds to the number 3.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. When a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition (unless it is a meso compound).\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Structure**: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an alkene.

This specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. Naming a specific, non-meso stereoisomer this way indicates that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer is chiral by definition.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active. All candidate answers agree on this point.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` combination of stereocenters in this symmetrical molecule results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion in certain conformations). This makes it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive. All candidate answers agree on this point.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). The naming conventions used in the question, such as (R), (S), or other stereodescriptors, imply that we are considering a single, specific stereoisomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific, non-meso stereoisomer indicates that we are considering a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group bisects the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center.

This indicates that a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule is being described. A single enantiomer is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and the name specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry (for example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this molecule's structure, `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which generally means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer (an enantiomer) of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion), making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-CH=`). This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe following compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each one for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image) and is not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. The naming conventions that specify a single stereoisomer (e.g., using R/S descriptors) imply we are considering a pure, non-racemic sample.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms of the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes specific stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates that the compound has chiral centers and that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) and a symmetrical structure. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion, depending on the conformation). This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different paths around the ring due to the position of the double bond. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposing CH₂ group bisects the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThus, there are 3 optically active compounds in the list. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning its molecular structure is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. If a compound is named with specific stereochemical descriptors like (R) or (S), it refers to a single enantiomer, which is optically active by definition (unless it's a meso compound).\n\nLet's analyze each compound step-by-step:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene.

A single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration in this symmetrical molecule results in an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the double bond's position. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and thus **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group). The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.

Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, and two different paths around the ring due to the presence of the double bond. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. This highly symmetrical molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group bisects the molecule. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. An analysis of the structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.
