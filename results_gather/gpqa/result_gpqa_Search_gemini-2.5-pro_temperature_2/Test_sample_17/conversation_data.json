    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Abundance Notation**\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. The formula is:\n\n`[A/B] = log₁₀(nₐ/nₑ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₐ/nₑ)ₛᵤₙ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `nₐ` and `nₑ` are the number densities of atoms of elements A and B.\n\nA useful property that stems from this definition is:\n\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\nThis can be seen by expanding the terms:\n`[A/H] - [B/H] = (log₁₀(nₐ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₐ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - (log₁₀(nₑ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₑ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n`= (log₁₀(nₐ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₑ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ) - (log₁₀(nₐ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ - log₁₀(nₑ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n`= log₁₀(nₐ/nₑ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₐ/nₑ)ₛᵤₙ = [A/B]`\n\nThe mass of the stars, the method used for determination (LTE, EW), and the Sun's specific Mg and Fe abundances are contextual details not required for the final ratio calculation, as these factors cancel out.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1**\n\nWe want to find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star 1, represented as `[Si/H]₁`. We can use the given values and the property derived above:\n*   `[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n*   Given: `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`\n*   Therefore, `[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2**\n\nSimilarly, we find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star 2, `[Si/H]₂`. We need to rearrange the formula:\n*   `[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\n*   Rearranging for `[Si/H]₂`: `[Si/H]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Mg/Si]₂`\n*   Given: `[Mg/H]₂ = 0` and `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`\n*   Therefore, `[Si/H]₂ = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n### **4. Determine the Ratio of Silicon Atoms**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. This is the ratio of their number densities relative to hydrogen, `(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂`.\n\nLet's find the logarithm of this ratio:\n*   `log₁₀ [ (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ ] = log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂`\n\nNow, let's use the fundamental definition of `[Si/H]`:\n*   `[Si/H]₁ = log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = 0.3`\n*   `[Si/H]₂ = log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = -0.3`\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n*   `[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂ = (log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - (log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n*   `0.3 - (-0.3) = log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂`\n*   `0.6 = log₁₀ [ (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ ]`\n\nTo find the final ratio, we take the antilogarithm:\n*   Ratio = `10⁰.⁶`\n*   Using `10⁰.³ ≈ 2`, we can approximate `10⁰.⁶ = (10⁰.³)² ≈ 2² = 4`.\n*   A more precise calculation gives `10⁰.⁶ ≈ 3.98`.\n\nThis value is closest to 3.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
