    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using the principles of special relativity.\n\n**1. Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince both astronauts are traveling in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity: `v1 = 0.6c`\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E1):\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5mc²`\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity: `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E2):\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²`\n`E_total ≈ 5.9641mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is approximately **5.96mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96mc². These results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
