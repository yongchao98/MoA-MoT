    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy change (ΔE) in the molecule for the specified transition. The momentum (p) of a photon is related to its energy by the equation p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**1. Molecular Model and Energy Levels**\nThe diatomic molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Vibrational Energy (E_vib)**: E_vib = ħω(v + 1/2)\n*   **Rotational Energy (E_rot)**: E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nHere, `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), ω is the angular frequency of vibration, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n**2. Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State**: The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Final State**: The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" that can be reached by absorbing a photon. Photon absorption in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule follows specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition to a higher rovibrational state is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1). While a purely rotational transition to (v=0, J=1) represents a smaller energy jump, the resulting photon momentum is orders of magnitude smaller than the provided options, indicating we must consider a vibrational transition.\n\n**3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\nThe energy of the transition is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\nΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\n\n*   E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n*   E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the intermediate values: the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I).\n\n*   **Given**:\n    *   Mx = 20 amu\n    *   My = 2 amu\n    *   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **Constants**:\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Atomic mass unit (amu) ≈ 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ)**:\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 amu * (1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.018 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I)**:\n    I = μR² = (3.018 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.207 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Transition Energy (ΔE)**:\n    The first term (vibrational) is:\n    ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n    The second term (rotational) is:\n    ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n    The total transition energy is:\n    ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy. Often, for such problems, approximating ΔE ≈ ħω is sufficient.\n\n**5. Photon Momentum Calculation**\nNow, we calculate the photon's momentum using p = ΔE / c.\n*   p = (4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 × 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.408 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is extremely close to 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\n<<<A>>>"
