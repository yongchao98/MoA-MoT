    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the amount of non-Gaussianity (`nG`).\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of Non-Gaussianity:**\n    The problem defines the measure of non-Gaussianity (`del_b`) using relative entropy. The formula provided is `del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`. This can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy `S(x) = -trace(x * ln(x))` as `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n\n2.  **Define the State `rho`:**\n    The state given is `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`. The density matrix `rho` is `|psi><psi|`. Since this is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` is zero. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference state: `del_b = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reference State `tau`:**\n    The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state. A crucial step is to determine which Gaussian state to use. The standard and most common choice is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as the state `rho`. This reference state, `tau_G`, is generally a squeezed thermal state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Moments of `rho`:**\n    For the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state becomes an \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state: `|psi^-> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>) / N_`.\n    *   The first moment (mean amplitude) is `<psi^-|a|psi^-> = 0`.\n    *   The second moments are the mean photon number `n_rho = <psi^-|a^†a|psi^->` and the squeezing term `c = <psi^-|a^2|psi^->`.\n    *   Standard calculations for the odd cat state yield:\n        *   `n_rho = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n        *   `c = |alpha|^2`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau_G)`:**\n    The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau_G` is determined by its single symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`. This eigenvalue is calculated from the covariance matrix of the state `rho`.\n    *   The symplectic eigenvalue is given by `ν = sqrt((n_rho + 1/2)^2 - |c|^2)`.\n    *   The von Neumann entropy of the Gaussian state `tau_G` is then calculated using the formula `S(tau_G) = (n_th + 1) * ln(n_th + 1) - n_th * ln(n_th)`, where `n_th = ν - 1/2` is the equivalent thermal photon number.\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Given `alpha = 0.5`, we have `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^0.25 + e^-0.25) / (e^0.25 - e^-0.25) ≈ (1.2840 + 0.7788) / (1.2840 - 0.7788) ≈ 4.083`.\n    *   `n_rho = 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.0208`.\n    *   The squeezing term is `c = alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n    *   Now, we calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n        `ν = sqrt((1.0208 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25^2) = sqrt(1.5208^2 - 0.0625) = sqrt(2.3128 - 0.0625) = sqrt(2.2503) ≈ 1.500`.\n    *   The equivalent thermal photon number is `n_th = ν - 1/2 = 1.500 - 0.5 = 1.0`.\n    *   Finally, we calculate the entropy:\n        `del_b = S(tau_G) = (1.0 + 1) * ln(1.0 + 1) - 1.0 * ln(1.0) = 2 * ln(2) - 0 ≈ 1.386`.\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
