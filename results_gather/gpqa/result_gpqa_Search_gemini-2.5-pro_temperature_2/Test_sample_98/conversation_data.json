    "### Compound Identification\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **`CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**.\n\n#### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which confirms the absence of carbon-carbon double bonds. This is consistent with all four proposed saturated structures.\n    *   The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns, which arise from spin-spin coupling between non-equivalent neighboring protons. The multiplicity of a signal is predicted by the **n+1 rule**, where 'n' is the number of equivalent adjacent protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, more complex patterns like doublets of triplets emerge.\n    *   The spectrum shows two particularly complex signals: a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. We must identify which proposed structure would produce both of these splitting patterns. The presence of chiral centers in the molecules leads to non-equivalent neighboring protons (diastereotopic protons), giving rise to such complex splitting.\n\n#### Evaluation of Potential Structures:\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments for each option:\n\n*   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C4 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H), the `CH2` group on the main chain (2H), and the C4-methyl group (3H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to three sets of protons with neighbor counts of 1H, 2H, and 2H. Thus, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C4 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H), the `CH2` of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the `CH2` group of the main chain at C5 (2H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) would produce a **dtt**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule has a combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) that would create a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C4 (1H), the `CH2` group at C2 (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This creates a **dtq** signal.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton with neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H, so a `dtt` is not produced.\n\n*   **C) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` (4-ethyl-3-(ethyl-), etc., IUPAC name is complex, but the connectivity is key):**\n    *Let's label the main carbon backbone starting from the end furthest from the carboxyl group: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(e)(Et)-CH2(h)-COOH`.\n    *   The proton **`H(e)`** is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: the proton `H(b)` (1H), the two protons of the adjacent methylene group `CH2(h)` (2H), and the two protons of the methylene group in its own ethyl sidechain (2H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) gives rise to a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton **`H(b)`** is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors: the proton `H(e)` (1H), the three protons of the terminal methyl group `CH3(a)` (3H), and the two protons of the methylene group in its ethyl sidechain (2H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 3H, 2H) creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** (the exact name depends on the relative J-coupling constants, but the multiplicity is correct).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStructure **C** is the only candidate that possesses the specific proton environments necessary to produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
