    "A dominant-negative mutation is one where the altered gene product not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein in the same cell. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to function. The heterozygous mutation Y is in the dimerization domain.\n\nThe most characteristic mechanism for a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein is that the mutant subunit can still form a dimer with a wild-type subunit. However, this resulting \"mixed\" dimer is nonfunctional. This sequestering of the wild-type protein into an inactive complex is what causes the loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nA possible fate for such a malformed or nonfunctional protein complex is to be recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation by the proteasome. This would result in the degradation of the mutant protein and any wild-type protein it is bound to.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect because a dominant-negative effect is a type of loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function. The altered protein antagonizes the normal protein's function.\n*   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutant protein could not dimerize at all, it would not be able to interfere with the wild-type subunits. The wild-type subunits could still form functional dimers, likely resulting in a recessive mutation (or haploinsufficiency if 50% of the protein is not enough), but not a dominant-negative phenotype.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can cause a loss-of-function and sometimes occurs with dominant mutations, it is a less specific description of the dominant-negative mechanism. The key feature is the direct interference with the wild-type protein, which this option doesn't explicitly describe.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely molecular phenotype. The mutant Y protein interferes with the wild-type protein (the definition of dominant-negative), leading to a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\". A very plausible molecular mechanism for this is the formation of non-functional wild-type/mutant dimers that are subsequently targeted for protein degradation.\n\nTherefore, the presence of mutant protein Y leads to the functional inactivation and likely degradation of the wild-type protein it partners with.\n\n<<<D>>>"
