    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M₁/M₂). The mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system that also exhibits eclipses, the total mass (M) of the system can be determined using the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) of the two stars. The formula, derived from Kepler's third law, is:\n\nM = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, and *i* is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight. The fact that both systems exhibit eclipses is crucial, as it implies their orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight. This means the inclination angle *i* is approximately 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. As a result, the sin³(i) term can be considered equal to 1 for both systems.\n\nWith this simplification, the mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nNow we can calculate this value for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system_2 (M_sys2):\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThis factor of ~0.432 is closest to the given option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
