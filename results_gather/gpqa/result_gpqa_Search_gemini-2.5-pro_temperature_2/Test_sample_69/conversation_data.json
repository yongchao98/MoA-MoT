    "This chemical riddle describes a series of reactions, and identifying the substances involved is key to determining the molecular symmetry of the final product, E.\n\n1.  **Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)**\n    This reaction strongly suggests the formation of phosgene gas from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas. Phosgene (COCl₂) is a toxic gas that can be used as a solvent in certain industrial applications.\n    *   **B** = Carbon Monoxide (CO)\n    *   **D** = Chlorine (Cl₂)\n    *   **H** = Phosgene (COCl₂)\n\n2.  **Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(bright red product)**\n    With B identified as carbon monoxide (CO), this reaction involves a solid reacting with 8 equivalents of CO to form a bright red product. This points to the formation of a metal carbonyl complex. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of dicobalt octacarbonyl from cobalt metal.\n    2 Co(s) + 8 CO(g) → Co₂(CO)₈\n    Dicobalt octacarbonyl is described as an orange to reddish-brown crystalline solid. Many other metal carbonyls are also known to be colored.\n    *   **A** = Cobalt (Co)\n    *   **C** = Dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co₂(CO)₈)\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)**\n    This reaction is the most challenging part of the riddle, as the direct hydrolysis of dicobalt octacarbonyl does not typically yield two distinct acids while regenerating the cobalt metal. However, in the context of chemical riddles, which sometimes contain simplified or idealized reactions, the other reactions strongly support the identification of A, B, C, and D. It's known that metal carbonyls can react with water or acids to form various products, including hydrogen and metal salts or hydroxides. The description of F and G is likely a component of the riddle designed to be perplexing.\n\n4.  **Reaction 2: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous product)**\n    With C being a cobalt carbonyl complex and D being chlorine gas (Cl₂), the reaction of C with chlorine would lead to the chlorination of the complex or its ligands. Given the constituents (cobalt, carbon, oxygen, and chlorine), a plausible highly toxic product would be phosgene itself, which has already been identified as H. Chlorination of metal carbonyls can be complex, but the production of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine is a standard industrial process. Phosgene is infamous for its use as a chemical weapon and is extremely toxic.\n    *   **E** = Phosgene (COCl₂)\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe molecule **E** is identified as phosgene (COCl₂). Its structure consists of a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. This trigonal planar geometry, which is not perfectly symmetrical due to the different bond lengths and angles, results in a specific point group. The molecule has a C₂ rotation axis and two perpendicular mirror planes. This combination of symmetry elements defines the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
