    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5. All three groups are in a *meta* relationship with each other.\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of these groups:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\nThe first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, which is then converted to a diazonium salt and finally back to benzene (deamination with H3PO2). These steps are redundant and make this an inefficient pathway. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence begins by converting benzene to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction does not work as intended. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the acylation reaction. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThe first step is the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene, not the required *meta* relationship. Furthermore, step (iii), a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitrated ring, would fail due to the strong deactivation by the nitro group. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze the initial steps of this sequence:\n1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is a standard and efficient reaction. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be directed to the *meta* position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. Now the ring has two substituents: the *meta*-directing acetyl group at C1 and the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group at C3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of competing directors, the substitution occurs primarily at position 5. Both existing groups are deactivating, but having them guide the final group into the correct 1,3,5-pattern makes this a viable synthetic route.\n\nThe first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear to be superfluous or incorrectly listed, as the desired product is already formed. However, compared to the other options which contain fundamental flaws in their reaction sequences (e.g., impossible reactions or incorrect stereochemistry), option D provides the only plausible pathway to the target compound. The initial three steps represent a correct and logical synthesis.\n\nTherefore, this sequence is the most plausible choice for achieving a high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
