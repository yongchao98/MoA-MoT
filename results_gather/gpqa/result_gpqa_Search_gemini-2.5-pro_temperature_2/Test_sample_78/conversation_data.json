    "### Analysis of the Reaction and Product\n\n1.  **Product Identification from NMR Spectra:**\n    The provided spectral data is crucial for identifying the reaction product.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone or an aldehyde. The signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 correspond to two different aliphatic carbons, most likely methyl groups. The multiple signals in the δ 126-145 range are characteristic of carbons in an aromatic ring and a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two sharp singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H), confirming the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. The two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) strongly suggest a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The remaining two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are characteristic of two protons on a C=C double bond that are coupled to each other.\n\n    Assembling these pieces, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone containing a *para*-substituted phenyl ring and an additional methyl group. The structure that fits all these observations is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as *p*-methylbenzalacetone). The *para*-tolyl group accounts for one methyl singlet and the two aromatic doublets (each 2H). The acetyl group (`-C(=O)CH₃`) accounts for the second methyl singlet and the ketone carbon. The `-CH=CH-` bridge accounts for the two vinyl proton doublets (each 1H). The molecular formula for this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches that of Compound X.\n\n2.  **Reaction Identification:**\n    Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), an epoxide, rearranges to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This type of reaction, the isomerization of an epoxide to a carbonyl compound, is known as the Meinwald rearrangement. The reaction is carried out with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which is a nucleophilic organic base capable of mediating this rearrangement. Specifically, the rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide (an epoxide with an adjacent C=C double bond) can lead to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compound X:**\n    Since the product contains a 4-methylphenyl group (a *p*-tolyl group), the starting material, Compound X, must also contain this structural unit. We can now evaluate the given options:\n    *   A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: A \"styryl\" group is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`. This contains a phenyl group, not a 4-methylphenyl group.\n    *   B) 2-styrylepoxide: The name is somewhat ambiguous, but \"styryl\" implies a phenyl group. The likely molecular formula, C₁₀H₁₀O, does not match.\n    *   C) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: A \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This compound contains the necessary 4-methylphenyl unit and has the correct molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O. It is a vinyl epoxide. The DABCO-catalyzed rearrangement of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane proceeds by abstracting an acidic proton from the carbon of the epoxide ring that is allylic to the double bond. Subsequent ring-opening and tautomerization of the resulting enol yields 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a chemically plausible pathway.\n    *   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: This compound contains a phenyl group, not a 4-methylphenyl group.\n\nBased on this analysis, Compound X must have the `p-tolyl` structural element to form the identified product. Only option C contains this feature.\n\n<<<C>>>"
