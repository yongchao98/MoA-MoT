    "Based on the IUPAC nomenclature rules for organic chemistry, the following steps are taken to determine the correct name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring. According to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, making the parent compound benzoic acid. The carbon atom to which the carboxylic acid group is attached is designated as position 1 (C1).\n\n**2. Identify and Position the Substituents:**\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** C1\n*   **Methoxy (-OCH₃):** Para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at C4.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN):** Both are meta to the carboxylic acid (at C3 and C5) and meta to each other. This confirms their placement at C3 and C5.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂]:** Both are ortho to the carboxylic acid (at C2 and C6). The description states the hydroxyl group is also ortho to the cyano group (at C5), which definitively places the hydroxyl group at C6. Consequently, the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\nThis arrangement gives the following structure:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n*   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CN (cyano)\n*   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Numbering Direction:**\nNumbering of the benzene ring must be done to assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** Assigns locants 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to the substituents -OH, -CN, -OCH₃, -CHO, and -N(CH₃)₂ respectively.\n    *   Substituent locants: C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   **Clockwise numbering:** Also assigns locants 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to the substituents.\n    *   Substituent locants: C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the same set of locants (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the \"first point of difference\" rule is applied using alphabetical order of the substituents to decide the numbering.\n\nThe substituents are named alphabetically as:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nWe compare the locants for each substituent based on the two possible numbering schemes:\n*   **Counter-clockwise path:** Cyano is at C3.\n*   **Clockwise path:** Cyano is at C5.\n\nBecause \"cyano\" comes first alphabetically and the counter-clockwise path gives it the lower number (3 vs. 5), this numbering scheme is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   C6: Dimethylamino\n*   C5: Formyl\n*   C2: Hydroxy\n*   C4: Methoxy\n*   C3: Cyano\n\n**4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name:**\nThe substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number.\n1.  **3-cyano-**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n3.  **5-formyl-**\n4.  **2-hydroxy-**\n5.  **4-methoxy-**\n\nCombining these alphabetically ordered prefixes with the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives the final IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
