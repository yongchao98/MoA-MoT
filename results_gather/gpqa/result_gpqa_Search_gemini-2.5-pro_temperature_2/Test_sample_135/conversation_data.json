    "The problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a specific vector field, ∫_V (∇·f) dV, within a sphere of radius R.\n\nThe vector field is defined as having a magnitude that falls off as 1/r² and is directed radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this field **f** can be written as:\n\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) * r̂\n\nwhere r is the radial distance from the origin and r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence (∇·f) in spherical coordinates yields:\n∇·f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * f_r)/∂r\nIn this case, the radial component f_r is 1/r².\n∇·f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis result, however, is only valid for r ≠ 0. At the origin (r=0), the vector field is infinite, creating a singularity. A naive integration of the divergence (which is 0 everywhere except the origin) over the volume would incorrectly yield a result of 0.\n\nThe correct method to solve this problem is to use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V to the flux of the field through the closed surface S that encloses the volume:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∮∮_S (f · n̂) dS\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R, and n̂ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector is simply the radial unit vector, n̂ = r̂.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n∮∮_S ( (1/r²) r̂ · r̂ ) dS\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. The dot product r̂ · r̂ is 1. Therefore, the integrand (f · n̂) simplifies to 1/R².\n\nThe surface integral is then:\n∮∮_S (1/R²) dS = (1/R²) ∮∮_S dS\n\nThe integral ∮∮_S dS is the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π\n\nThis result shows that the non-zero value of the integral comes from the \"source\" of the divergence at the singularity (r=0) enclosed within the volume. The divergence of this particular field is technically a Dirac delta function at the origin, specifically 4πδ(r), and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
