    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D.\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   A 6H signal that is a triplet indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   A 4H signal that is a quartet indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   This splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) and integration ratio (6H:4H, which simplifies to 3H:2H) is the classic signature of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃CH₂-).\n*   The chemical shifts (0.9 and 1.3 ppm) are in the typical alkane region. The most plausible simple alkane that would be a common starting material is **n-butane** (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). While the internal CH₂ groups of n-butane are technically split by five adjacent protons (2+3), which should result in a sextet, in introductory problems, this complex splitting is sometimes simplified or the shifts are given in an idealized manner. Given the subsequent reactions, n-butane is the most logical starting point.\n\n**2. Identification of Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation (e.g., using Br₂ and UV light).\n*   Bromination can occur at a primary carbon (C1) to form 1-bromobutane or at a secondary carbon (C2) to form 2-bromobutane. Substitution at the secondary carbon is favored.\n*   Thus, Compound B is predominantly **2-bromobutane** (CH₃CHBrCH₂CH₃).\n\n**3. Identification of Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong, non-bulky base, favoring an E2 elimination reaction to form an alkene.\n*   Elimination of HBr can form two possible products:\n    *   **But-1-ene** (by removing a proton from C1).\n    *   **But-2-ene** (by removing a proton from C3).\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers, but but-2-ene exists as *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, Compound C is **but-2-ene**. The reaction produces a mixture of the *cis* and *trans* isomers.\n\n**4. Identification of Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol in a Diels-Alder reaction to produce Compound D.\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n*   **Diels-Alder Reaction Analysis**: This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The product's IUPAC name is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**, which immediately eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the *endo rule*.\n    1.  **Diene Stereochemistry**: The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In the s-cis conformation required for the reaction, the hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are \"inner\" substituents, while the hydrogen on C1 and the methyl group (-CH₃) on C4 are \"outer\" substituents. In the product, substituents that were inner on the diene end up cis to each other, and outer substituents end up cis to each other. An inner substituent will be *trans* to an outer substituent. Therefore, in the product, the **-OH at C1 is *trans* to the -CH₃ at C4**.\n    2.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry**: The reaction is stereospecific with respect to the dienophile. Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups at the newly formed C5 and C6 will be **cis** to each other in the product.\n    3.  **Endo Rule**: The *endo rule* states that the substituents on the dienophile prefer to be positioned \"endo\" (under the diene's π-system). This places them on the same face of the newly forming ring as the \"inner\" substituents of the diene. Therefore, the **two methyl groups (at C5 and C6) are *cis* to the hydroxyl group at C1**.\n\n*   **Final Relative Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The -OH at C1, the -CH₃ at C5, and the -CH₃ at C6 are all *cis* to each other.\n    *   The -CH₃ at C4 is *trans* to these three groups.\n\n*   **Assigning Absolute Configuration (R/S)**: Let's assume one of the two possible enantiomers is formed. We can place the group of three cis substituents (-OH, -CH₃ at C5, -CH₃ at C6) \"up\" (wedge) and the single -CH₃ at C4 \"down\" (dash). Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities for each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6) leads to the configuration **(1R, 4S, 5R, 6R)**.\n\n*   The reaction produces a racemic mixture, meaning the other enantiomer is also formed in equal amounts. The enantiomer of (1R, 4S, 5R, 6R) has all stereocenters inverted, which gives **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6S)**.\n\n*   Comparing this result to the options provided:\n    *   A) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n    *   B) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n    *   C) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n    *   D) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol\n\n    Our derived configuration, (1S, 4R, 5S, 6S), exactly matches option C.\n\nThus, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
