    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct transition route and probability:\n\n1.  **Initial and Final States**: The hydrogen atom starts in the |3,0,0⟩ state (also known as the 3s state) and ends in the |1,0,0⟩ state (the 1s ground state). The process occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n2.  **Electric Dipole Selection Rules**: For an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n    *   The magnetic quantum number, *m*, must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n    *   The principal quantum number, *n*, can change by any integer value, but transitions to lower energy levels are spontaneous.\n\n3.  **First Transition**: The atom decays from the initial state |3,0,0⟩.\n    *   Since the initial *l* is 0, the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1 dictates that the intermediate state must have *l* = 1.\n    *   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease. The decay must proceed via an intermediate state from which it can then decay to *n*=1. The only state with *l*=1 between *n*=3 and *n*=1 is the *n*=2 state.\n    *   Therefore, the intermediate state must be |2,1,*m*'⟩.\n    *   Applying the Δ*m* selection rule, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number *m*' are *m*' = 0 + (0, ±1), which gives *m*' = -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   So, the first transition must be to one of the |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩ states.\n\n4.  **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state |2,1,*m*'⟩, the atom decays to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   The change in *l* is from *l*=1 to *l*=0, so Δ*l* = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The change in *m* from *m*' to *m*=0 must satisfy Δ*m* = 0, ±1. All three intermediate states (*m*'= -1, 0, 1) can transition to *m*=0.\n\n5.  **Transition Routes**: All three routes proposed in the options (A, C, D) are physically possible based on the selection rules.\n    *   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n    *   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n6.  **Calculating Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**: The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total decay rate from |3,0,0⟩ is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states |2,1,*m*'⟩. The probability of any single route is the ratio of its transition rate to the total transition rate.\n\n    The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment. Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3,0,0⟩ state (an s-orbital), it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the transition probabilities to the three degenerate magnetic sublevels (*m*'= -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1⟩ state are equal.\n\n    Therefore, the atom has an equal chance of decaying into any of the three intermediate states. The total probability of 1 is split equally among the three paths.\n\n    *   Probability ( |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ ) = 1/3\n    *   Probability ( |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ ) = 1/3\n    *   Probability ( |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ ) = 1/3\n\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate |2,1,*m*'⟩ state, it will decay to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state with a probability of 1 (as this is the only allowed dipole transition). Thus, the probability of the entire cascade is simply the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4: Incorrect. The probability is 1/3.\n    *   **B)** ...⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3: Incorrect. The probability is 1/3.\n    *   **C)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3: **Correct**. The path is valid, and the probability is 1/3.\n    *   **D)** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4: Incorrect. The probability is 1/3.\n\nThe correct transition route and corresponding probability are given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
