    "A chemist performs two reactions that result in different stereoisomers, which are then analyzed together. To determine the outcome of the chromatographic analysis, we must first identify the products of each reaction.\n\n### Analysis of the Chemical Reactions\n\nThe two reactions perform an anti-dihydroxylation on geometric isomers of oct-4-ene. This process occurs in two steps: epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a trans-alkene, undergoes anti-dihydroxylation. The general stereochemical rule for a symmetric trans-alkene is that anti-addition results in a single meso compound.\n    *   **Step 1:** Treatment with mCPBA (a peroxy acid) creates a trans-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane is formed.\n    *   **Step 2:** Aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring via anti-attack. Hydrolysis of either the (4R,5R) or the (4S,5S) enantiomer yields the same meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis-alkene, undergoes anti-dihydroxylation. The rule for a symmetric cis-alkene is that anti-addition results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step 1:** Treatment with mCPBA results in a syn-addition of oxygen, forming a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis opens this meso epoxide. The backside attack of water occurs with equal probability at either of the two carbons of the epoxide ring, leading to the formation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### The Combined Product Mixture\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe enantiomers from Reaction 2 are diastereomers of the meso compound from Reaction 1.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe product mixture is then analyzed using two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers, such as the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral HPLC.\n    *   Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and another for the unresolved racemic mixture.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with the (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers, causing them to elute at different times and thus be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers and will also be separated, appearing as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Consequently, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
