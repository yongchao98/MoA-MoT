    "The search results confirm my approach.\n\n1.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth**: Multiple sources confirm that for a simple transit model (without considering limb darkening), the transit depth (ΔF/F) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area:\n    ΔF/F = (πR_planet²) / (πR_star²) = (R_planet / R_star)²\n\n2.  **Starspot Rotational Modulation**: The search results discuss the concept of rotational modulation caused by starspots, where the amplitude of the light curve is related to the spot distribution and contrast. While they don't provide a single, simple formula like the one for transit depth (as it's a more complex phenomenon), the physical basis I used for my derivation is correct. The amplitude of the modulation is driven by the flux difference between the bright (unspotted) and dark (spotted) regions rotating into and out of view. My formula, A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴], is a standard and direct way to model this amplitude under the given simplifying assumptions (a hemisphere uniformly covered with a certain filling factor).\n\nThe initial calculations appear robust.\n\n*   **Starspot Amplitude (A_spot):**\n    *   Teff = 6000 K\n    *   Tspot = 5000 K\n    *   Filling factor (f) = 0.20\n    *   A_spot = f * [1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴]\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * [1 - 625/1296] = 0.20 * [671/1296] ≈ 0.10355\n\n*   **Exoplanet Transit Depth (A_planet):**\n    *   A_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n*   **Equating the two:**\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is very close to 0.32. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nTo produce the final answer, I will outline the steps clearly.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the amplitude of the star's brightness variation.**\n    The variation is caused by one hemisphere being covered in spots. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n    *   Let the flux from the unspotted photosphere be F_phot ∝ T_eff⁴.\n    *   Let the flux from the starspots be F_spot ∝ T_spot⁴.\n    *   Assuming the filling factor `f` applies to the projected stellar disk, the maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere faces us) is F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴, where A_disk is the area of the stellar disk.\n    *   The minimum flux (when the spotted hemisphere faces us) is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas on the disk: F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴.\n    *   The relative amplitude of the variation is A_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n    *   A_spot = (A_disk*T_eff⁴ - [(1-f)*A_disk*T_eff⁴ + f*A_disk*T_spot⁴]) / (A_disk*T_eff⁴)\n    *   A_spot = (T_eff⁴ - (1-f)T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\n    *   A_spot = (f*T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\n    *   A_spot = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    *   Plugging in the values: f = 0.2, T_eff = 6000K, T_spot = 5000K.\n    *   A_spot = 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)⁴] = 0.2 * [1 - 0.48225] = 0.10355.\n\n2.  **Calculate the equivalent exoplanet transit signal.**\n    An exoplanet transit causes a dip in brightness (transit depth) equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    *   Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)².\n\n3.  **Equate the two signals.**\n    To produce the same amplitude, the transit depth must equal the spot modulation amplitude.\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = A_spot\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218.\n\n4.  **Compare with the options.**\n    The calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D.\n\nThe logic holds, and the calculations are straightforward. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) relative to its host star (Rstar) that would produce the same signal amplitude as the described starspots, we must first calculate the amplitude of the rotational modulation and then equate it to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Amplitude of Rotational Modulation due to Spots\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted one. The amplitude of this variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, normalized by the maximum flux.\n\nThe flux (F) from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power.\n    F_max ∝ T_eff⁴ = 6000⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by cooler spots. The total flux is a weighted average of the temperatures of the unspotted and spotted portions.\n    *   Fraction of photosphere = 1 - f = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n    *   Fraction of spots = f = 0.2\n    *   Temperature of photosphere (T_eff) = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature of spots (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n    F_min ∝ (0.8 * 6000⁴) + (0.2 * 5000⁴)\n\nThe relative amplitude (A_spot) is calculated as:\nA_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nA_spot = (T_eff⁴ - [(1-f)T_eff⁴ + f*T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\nA_spot = (f*T_eff⁴ - f*T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nA_spot = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nA_spot = 0.2 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\nA_spot = 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nA_spot = 0.2 * [1 - 0.48225]\nA_spot = 0.2 * 0.51775\nA_spot ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### 2. Transit Depth of a Hypothetical Exoplanet\n\nThe signal from an exoplanet transit is the fraction of the star's light that it blocks. This \"transit depth\" is equal to the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the relative radius of the planet that produces the same signal amplitude, we set the transit depth equal to the spot modulation amplitude.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = A_spot\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 is the closest match.\n<<<D>>>"
