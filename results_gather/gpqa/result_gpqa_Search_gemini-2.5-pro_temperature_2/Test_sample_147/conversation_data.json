    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct range for the molecular weight of substance A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y from Substance A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for the mass percentage of fluorine is:\n\nɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_Y` is the atomic weight of element Y.\n*   `M_F` is the atomic weight of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n*   `n` is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for `M_Y`:\n\nM_Y = (n * M_F * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\nM_Y = (n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe can test integer values for `n` to find a matching element Y:\n*   **If n = 3**, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic weight of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. The fluorine content of SbF₃ is approximately 31.88%, a very close match.\n*   **If n = 6**, M_Y ≈ 40.45 * 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This value is a near-perfect match for certain isotopes of Plutonium (Pu). For instance, for the isotope Pu-242, the calculated fluorine percentage in PuF₆ is 32.01%, also very close to the given value.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Candidates: Antimony (Sb) vs. Plutonium (Pu)**\n\nWe have two strong candidates for element Y: Antimony and Plutonium. Let's evaluate them against the other clues provided.\n\n*   **Chemistry of A1 and A3:** The problem states A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at room temperature (293 K) and oxidizes xenon. A3 also interacts with xenon.\n    *   **Plutonium:** The chemistry of plutonium fits these descriptions remarkably well. Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF₆) is a reddish-brown solid known to be thermally unstable at room temperature, and it is a powerful enough oxidizing agent to react with xenon.\n    *   **Antimony:** The higher fluoride of antimony is SbF₅. It is a colorless liquid, not bright-red, and it is not capable of oxidizing xenon gas from its elemental state. While it reacts with xenon fluorides, it acts as a fluoride ion acceptor, not an oxidizer for Xe(0).\n\nThis strongly suggests that Y is Plutonium. However, a problem arises. The decomposition of A1 produces A2. If A1 is PuF₆, it would decompose to a lower fluoride like PuF₄, not into A2, which we identified from its fluorine percentage as PuF₆ itself. This represents a contradiction within the problem statement.\n\n*   **Reaction to form A5:** A5 is formed by adding element Y to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests a comproportionation reaction.\n    *   **For Plutonium:** `Pu + PuF₆ → 2PuF₃`. This reaction is balanced and features a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. It implies that A4 would be PuF₆.\n    *   **For Antimony:** A similar reaction like `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` has a 2:3 ratio, not 1:1. Another possibility, `Sb + SbF₃ → ?`, is not a standard comproportionation to a stable binary fluoride.\n\nThe chemical clues strongly point toward Plutonium. However, calculating the molecular weight of the proposed substance A4 (PuF₆) gives a value of approximately 356-358 g/mol, which does not fit into any of the provided answer ranges.\n\n**3. Resolving the Contradiction**\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question, the correct answer must lie within one of the provided ranges. This suggests that the numerical data is the most reliable path to the solution, even if some of the descriptive chemical properties in the problem are flawed or misleading. Let's reconsider Antimony based on the numerical evidence.\n\n1.  The identification of Y as **Antimony (Sb)** and A2 as **SbF₃** is numerically sound based on the mass percentage provided.\n2.  The binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. A4 must be one of these compounds.\n3.  Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   **M(SbF₃)** = 121.76 + (3 * 19.00) = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    *   **M(SbF₅)** = 121.76 + (5 * 19.00) = **216.76 g/mol**.\n4.  Comparing these molecular weights to the given options:\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 220-240\n    *   D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range A. The molecular weight of SbF₅ does not fit well into any range. Therefore, it is most probable that A4 is intended to be SbF₃.\n\nAlthough the descriptive chemistry (red color, xenon oxidation) does not match the properties of antimony fluorides, the numerical data strongly and unambiguously points to A4 being SbF₃. In such puzzle-like problems with conflicting information, the numerical clues often provide the intended path to the solution.\n\nThus, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<A>>>"
