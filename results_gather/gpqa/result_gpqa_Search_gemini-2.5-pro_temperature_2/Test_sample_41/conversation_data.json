    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the orbital period ratio.\n\n### 1. Understanding the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis (the orbital distance from the star).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light reflected).\n\nIn this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3). Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) are constant. This simplifies the relationship to:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Distances\n\nWe are given the following ratios of equilibrium temperatures:\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 3:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\cdot 2.3 = 3.22$\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between temperature and orbital distance to find the ratio of the orbital distances ($a_3/a_1$):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = (\\frac{a_1}{a_3})^{-1/2} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_1}}$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_1}} = 3.22$\n\nSquaring both sides gives us the ratio of the orbital distances:\n\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = (3.22)^2 = 10.3684$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_3/P_1$), we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods is:\n\n$(\\frac{P_3}{P_1})^2 = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^3$\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = ((\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{1/2})^3 = (\\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_1}})^3$\n\nFrom our temperature calculation, we already know that $\\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_1}} = 3.22$. Plugging this value in:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 = 3.22 \\cdot 3.22 \\cdot 3.22 \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method are not needed for this calculation, as the mass of the planets is negligible compared to their host star.\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
