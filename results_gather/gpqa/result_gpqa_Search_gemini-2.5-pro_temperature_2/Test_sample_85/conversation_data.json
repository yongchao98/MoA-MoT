    "Based on the established principles of organic chemistry, the following analysis determines the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**General Starting Material:** The starting material for both reactions is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid. Specifically, it is a monoester named 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule possesses two distinct carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl). The structure also contains a chiral center at the third carbon (C3), which will be either (R) or (S).\n\n**Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The formation of this lactone occurs via an intramolecular reaction of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid derivative.\n\n### **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters and lactones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** In this reaction, the LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position untouched.\n*   **Intermediate:** The resulting intermediate is (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n*   **Lactonization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization processes do not affect the configuration of the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the final product. To yield **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a strong reducing agent that exhibits high selectivity for carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** In this case, the BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid at the C1 position to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the isobutyl ester at the C5 position remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate:** The intermediate formed is the isobutyl ester of (R)- or (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As with the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, and its configuration is retained. To obtain **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the selective reactivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry, the correct starting materials are:\n\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
