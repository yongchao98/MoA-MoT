    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles of CH3COOH.\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H+.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles of Ba(OH)2. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely to yield two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n        Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles of OH-.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n        Moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n        Moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n        The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Since there are more moles of OH-, all the H+ will be consumed.\n        Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n        Moles of remaining OH- = 0.100 mol\n        Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n        The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the acetic acid will be consumed.\n        Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with CH3COOH = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n        This reaction also produces 0.050 moles of the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- (a strong base) and 0.050 moles of CH3COO- (a weak base). The pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of the strong base, as its contribution to the overall hydroxide concentration is far more significant than that of the weak base.\n    *   First, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n        Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   Next, calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions:\n        [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   Now, calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14:\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
