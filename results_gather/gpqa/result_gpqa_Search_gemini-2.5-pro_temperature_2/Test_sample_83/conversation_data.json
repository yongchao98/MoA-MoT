    "The key factor in converting the sequential algorithm to a parallel one lies in the decomposition of the computational workload. When the matrix exponential function `exp(lA)` is approximated by a rational function (a fractional approximation) `R(lA)`, this rational function can often be expressed in partial fractions.\n\nThis linear partial fraction decomposition breaks down the complex problem `R(lA)v` into a sum of simpler, independent tasks. Each term in the partial fraction expansion corresponds to solving a linear system of the form `(A - p_i * I)y_i = b`, where `p_i` are the poles of the rational approximation. Since these linear systems are independent of each other, they can be solved concurrently on multiple processors. This technique is the foundation of the \"parallel splitting\" method, where the \"splitting\" refers to the partial fraction splitting of the rational approximation.\n\n*   **A) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:** This is the correct mechanism. As the sources confirm, partial fraction decomposition allows a large, single task to be split into numerous independent sub-tasks, which is the essence of parallelization.\n*   **B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This typically complicates parallelization by introducing dependencies across the domain, rather than enabling it.\n*   **C) Stability analysis:** Stability is a prerequisite for any valid numerical algorithm, whether sequential or parallel, but it is not the feature that enables the parallelization itself.\n*   **D) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots (real or complex) affects the specifics of the implementation (e.g., complex roots come in conjugate pairs and may be solved together), but the fundamental enabling step is the decomposition into partial fractions, regardless of the nature of the roots. The method works because of the decomposition.\n\nTherefore, the partial fraction decomposition is the key factor that allows for the conversion of the algorithm into a parallel form.\n\n<<<A>>>"
