    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which planet has the higher transit probability.\n\n### 1. Transit Probability Formula\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n\n*   **P_transit ≈ R_star / a**\n\nWhere:\n*   `P_transit` is the probability of a transit.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the host star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Known Variables\n\nThe problem does not provide the semi-major axis (`a`), but it does give the orbital period (`P`) and information about the stellar mass (`M_star`). We can use Kepler's Third Law to establish a relationship between these variables. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. The full form of the law is:\n\n*   **P² = (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³**\n\nSolving for the semi-major axis (`a`), we get:\n\n*   **a = (G * M_star * P² / 4π²)^(1/3)**\n\nThis shows that the semi-major axis is proportional to the cube root of the stellar mass and the orbital period squared:\n\n*   **a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)**\n\n### 3. Combining the Formulas\n\nBy substituting the expression for the semi-major axis into the transit probability formula, we can see how the probability depends on the given variables:\n\n*   **P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)**\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities\n\nTo find out which planet is more likely to transit and by how much, we can calculate the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2.\n\n*   **Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = [R_star1 / (M_star1 * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [R_star2 / (M_star2 * P₂²)^(1/3)]**\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to group the terms for each variable:\n\n*   **Ratio = (R_star1 / R_star2) * (M_star2 / M_star1)^(1/3) * (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)**\n\n### 5. Applying the Specific Information\n\nNow, we can insert the values provided in the problem:\n\n*   The host stars have the same radii: **R_star1 = R_star2** → (R_star1 / R_star2) = 1\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: **M_star1 = 2 * M_star2** → (M_star2 / M_star1) = 1/2\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: **P₁ = P₂ / 3** → (P₂ / P₁) = 3\n\nPlugging these into the ratio equation:\n\n*   **Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)**\n*   **Ratio = (1/2)^(1/3) * (9)^(1/3)**\n*   **Ratio = (9/2)^(1/3)**\n*   **Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)**\n*   **Ratio ≈ 1.65**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
