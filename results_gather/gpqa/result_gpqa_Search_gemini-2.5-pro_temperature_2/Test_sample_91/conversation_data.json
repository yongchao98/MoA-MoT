    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of formation:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to count the bonds correctly.\n\n*   The structure is an unbranched chain of 7 carbons with 5 methyl groups attached at various positions.\n*   **Carbons (C):** There are 7 carbons in the main chain and 5 carbons in the methyl groups, for a total of 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** There are 5 methyl (CH3) groups, totaling 15 hydrogens. The main chain has H atoms at specific positions: =CH- (1 H), -CH2- (2 H), -CH(CH3)- (1 H), -CH2- (2 H), -CH= (1 H). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 15 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 22.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond\n\n*   **C=C Double Bonds:** There are two double bonds in the molecule: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -**CH=C**(CH3)2.\n    *   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   **C-H Single Bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom.\n    *   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n*   **C-C Single Bonds:** For a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and multiple) is the number of carbon atoms minus one (C-1).\n    *   Total C-C and C=C bonds = 12 - 1 = 11\n    *   Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound\n\nThe total bond energy is the energy required to break down one mole of the gaseous compound into its constituent gaseous atoms. This is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy:** 600 kJ + 1800 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (12 moles of C(graphite) and 11 moles of H2(g)) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** We need 22 moles of H atoms, which come from 11 moles of H2 molecules.\n    *   11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound is formed from these atoms (which equals the total bond energy of the compound). The formula is:\n\n**ΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the compound)**\n\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. This is not directly available as an option in kJ/mol. We should check if the answer matches one of the options in kJ/g.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) = **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
