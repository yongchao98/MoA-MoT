    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars are detectable by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **1. Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be detectable by both instruments, it must meet two conditions:\n*   **Location (Declination):** It must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere (Chile, latitude ~24.5° S) and the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (Hawaii, latitude ~19.8° N). This means the star's declination (DEC) must be within a range accessible to both. A star at latitude `lat` can theoretically observe objects with a declination `DEC` if `|DEC - lat| ≤ 90°`.\n    *   **Keck (lat ≈ +20°):** The viewable declination range is approximately -70° to +90°.\n    *   **Paranal (lat ≈ -24.5°):** The viewable declination range is approximately -90° to +65.5°.\n    *   Therefore, the overlapping range visible to both observatories is a declination between approximately **-70° and +65.5°**.\n*   **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the limit of both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: `m_V` < 17.0 mag\n    *   HIRES limit: `m_V` < 16.0 mag\n    *   For a star to be observed by both, it must satisfy the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be **brighter than 16.0 mag**.\n\n### **2. Star Evaluation**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (`m_V`) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d`), and extinction (`A_V`) using the formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`\nwhere extinction `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star1**\n    *   `DEC = -75°`: This is outside the observable range for the Keck Observatory (`DEC > -70°`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star2**\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 mag`: This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star3**\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 mag`: This is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit. The additional information about color excess `E(B-V)` is considered supplementary, as \"apparent magnitude\" refers to the brightness as observed from Earth.\n    *   `DEC = +48°`: This is within the shared observable range of -70° to +65.5°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star4**\n    *   `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.24 mag**.\n    *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n*   **Star5**\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = **14.995 mag**.\n    *   This is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n    *   `DEC = +60°`: This is within the shared observable range of -70° to +65.5°.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the only stars that meet both the location and brightness criteria for both observatories are **Star 3 and Star 5**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
