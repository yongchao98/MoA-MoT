    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we first need to understand the relationship between parallax and distance, and then relate the given distribution of stars per unit of parallax to the distribution per unit of distance.\n\n### The Relationship Between Distance and Parallax\n\nStellar parallax is the apparent shift of a nearby star's position against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax angle. This relationship is expressed by the simple formula:\n\n`d = 1 / p`\n\nwhere:\n*   `d` is the distance to the star, typically measured in parsecs.\n*   `p` is the parallax angle, measured in arcseconds.\n\n### Transforming the Star Distribution\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars, when counted per unit of parallax (`plx`), varies as `1/plx⁵`. Let's denote the number of stars per unit parallax interval as `N_plx`.\nSo, `N_plx ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\n\nWe want to find how the number of stars per unit distance interval, which we can call `N_r`, varies with distance `r`.\n\nThe number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval `dr`. Therefore, we can write:\n\n`N_r * |dr| = N_plx * d(plx)`\n\nFrom this, we get:\n\n`N_r = N_plx * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\nTo find the term `|d(plx)/dr|`, we differentiate the distance-parallax relationship `plx = 1/r`:\n\n`d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`\n\nThe absolute value is `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\nNow we can substitute this back into our equation for `N_r`:\n\n`N_r ∝ N_plx * (1/r²)`\n\nWe are given that `N_plx ∝ 1/plx⁵`. We need to express this in terms of distance `r`. Since `plx = 1/r`, it follows that `1/plx = r`. Substituting this into the proportionality gives:\n\n`N_plx ∝ r⁵`\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for `N_plx` back into the equation for `N_r`:\n\n`N_r ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) = r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) in that region of the sky changes in proportion to `r³`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
