    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **1. Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is derived by balancing the energy absorbed from the star with the energy radiated by the planet. It can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1 / a)¹ᐟ²\n\nWhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the average distance from the star).\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Since all other factors, such as the star's properties and the planets' albedos, are the same for both Planet_4 and Planet_2, they cancel out when we take the ratio of their temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₄)¹ᐟ²\n\n### **2. Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). Mathematically:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis means we can establish a relationship for the ratio of the semi-major axes based on the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n(a₂ / a₄)³ = (P₂ / P₄)²\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)²ᐟ³\n\n### **3. Combining the Formulas**\n\nNow, we substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P₂ / P₄)²ᐟ³ ]¹ᐟ²\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)⁽²ᐟ³⁾ * ⁽¹ᐟ²⁾\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³\n\n### **4. Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we have:\n\n*   P₂ corresponds to the value 2.\n*   P₄ corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nThe ratio P₂ / P₄ is therefore 2 / 3.5.\n\nPlugging this into our final equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
