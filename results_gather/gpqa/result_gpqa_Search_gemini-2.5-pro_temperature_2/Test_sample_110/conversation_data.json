    "Based on my analysis of the reactions, which is consistent with the general principles of Michael additions, the correct products have been determined.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the ketone at the alpha-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has only one available alpha-proton, which is at the C-6 position. The C-2 position is a quaternary carbon with no protons. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C-6, forming a specific enolate.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate will attack the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product A Structure**: The resulting product is ethyl 3-(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-1-oxocyclohex-6-yl)propanoate. To name this according to the options provided, the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain. The carbon of the ring attached to the chain is designated as C-1 of the substituent. Following IUPAC rules for this numbering, the keto group is at C-2, and there is an ethyl and a methyl group at C-3, and another methyl group at C-1. Alphabetizing the substituents leads to the name **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) to create a nucleophilic nitronate anion.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n3.  **Product B Structure**: The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the alpha-carbon of the original nitropropane and the beta-carbon of the original butenenitrile. The resulting structure is CH₃CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)CH₂CN.\n4.  **Nomenclature**: To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group. This is a six-carbon chain, making it a hexanenitrile. The substituents are a methyl group at C-3 and a nitro group at C-4. Therefore, the correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nProduct A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, and product B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
