    "### Analysis of the Spectral Data\n\n1.  **Compound Type:** The problem states the unknown is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having the base formula C6H4.\n2.  **FTIR Analysis:** The spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **¹H NMR Analysis:** The ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most detailed information for deducing the structure.\n    *   **Six signals:** This implies there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in two distinct signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. The splitting pattern provides clear evidence for the structure of this group. A \"doublet of quartets\" indicates a proton coupled to one adjacent proton (creating the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons, like a methyl group (creating the quartet). A \"doublet\" indicates a proton coupled to only one other proton. This specific combination is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** One of these methyl signals corresponds to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group. An ester containing a methyl group can be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH₃`). Both of these structures contain one methyl group and no -CH₂ groups.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This information is crucial as it rules out other possible structures, such as those containing ethyl (`-CH2CH3`) or allyl (`-CH2-CH=CH2`) groups. An allyl group, for example, is named 2-propenyl and has a `CH2` group. The described NMR data fits a 1-propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has no `CH2` group.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nBased on the analysis, we can piece together the fragments of the molecule:\n\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **-C₃H₅** (composed of `-CH=CH-` and a `-CH₃`)\n*   An ester group containing one methyl group: **-C₂H₃O₂** (either `-COOCH₃` or `-OCOCH₃`)\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total chemical formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from benzene ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester group)\n\nThe calculated chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to compounds like (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. It is also the formula for 4-Allylphenyl acetate, although the NMR data better supports the propen-1-yl isomer, which lacks a CH₂ group. Many other isomers with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ exist, but they do not match the specific NMR data provided.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
