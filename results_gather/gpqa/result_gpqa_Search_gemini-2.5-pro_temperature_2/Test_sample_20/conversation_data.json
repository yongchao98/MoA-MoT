    "**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomers are isomers that readily interconvert, typically by the migration of a hydrogen atom (a proton) and a shift of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a ketone must generally have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, known as an alpha-hydrogen.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (they are sp2 hybridized) and do not have alpha-hydrogens that can be easily removed to form a stable enol. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound possesses hydrogen atoms on carbons situated between two carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). These alpha-hydrogens are highly acidic and readily removed. The resulting enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is an aromatic compound. The stability gained by forming an aromatic ring makes this tautomerization particularly favorable.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone (A)**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is trans-dimethyl but-2-enedioate. It has a carbon-carbon double bond which prevents free rotation and creates geometric isomers (the cis-isomer being dimethyl maleate). However, the molecule itself is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, it is achiral and cannot have a non-superimposable mirror image. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B)**.\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   (A) = benzoquinone\n*   (B) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
