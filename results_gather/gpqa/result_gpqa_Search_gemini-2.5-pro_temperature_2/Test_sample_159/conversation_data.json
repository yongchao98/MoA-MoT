    "An aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach a circular aperture of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. The diffraction pattern created by a circular aperture in the far-field is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J_1(x). The condition for the m-th minimum is given by the formula:\n\n`sin(θ) ≈ θ = (z_m * λ) / (π * D)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the center.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `D` is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function `J_1(x)`.\n\nIn this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle, so the diameter `D = 2a`. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (π * 2a) = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular positions of the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the `J_1(x)` Bessel function:\n*   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position for each minimum:\n*   **First minimum (m=1):** `θ_1 = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n*   **Second minimum (m=2):** `θ_2 = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\n`Δθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis result is closest to option B. Option C, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum (`θ_1`), which is a common value known as the Rayleigh criterion for resolution when expressed in terms of the aperture radius. However, the question specifically asks for the separation between the first and second minima.\n\n<<<B>>>"
