    "Here is a step-by-step identification of the unknown compound based on the provided ¹H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A signal with an integration of 3 protons that is a singlet (s) is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) with no adjacent protons. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is typical for a methyl group of an acetate (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is expected in all of them.\n    *   **Integral count:** The remaining signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm have proton integrations of 1H, 1H, and 3H, respectively. This adds up to 5 protons. This count fits a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-), which has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 protons. It does not fit a butenyl group, which would have more protons. This eliminates Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a signal for one vinyl proton (a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton. Crucially, the coupling constant (*J*) is 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinyl protons in a *trans* configuration are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while *cis* protons have a smaller coupling constant of 6-15 Hz. The large value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinyl protons.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This represents a methyl group of 3 protons that is a doublet (d). This indicates it is adjacent to a single proton. This fits the CH₃-CH= part of a propenyl group.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for one proton is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors: one neighboring proton (which splits the signal into a doublet) and a group of three equivalent neighboring protons (which splits the signal into a quartet).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   From the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), we can conclude the compound has a *trans* double bond. This eliminates Cis-propenyl acetate.\n    *   The only remaining option is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that its structure matches all the data.\n\n    **Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n    ```\n        H₃C(a)     H(c)\n           \\      /\n            C = C\n           /      \\\n        H(b)      O-CO-CH₃(d)\n    ```\n\n    *   **Protons (d) - CH₃(d):** The acetate methyl group has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. Its chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is standard. This matches **2.1 (3H, s)**.\n    *   **Protons (a) - CH₃(a):** This methyl group is attached to the double bond. It is adjacent to proton H(b), so its signal is split into a doublet. This matches **1.6 (3H, d)**.\n    *   **Proton (c) - H(c):** This vinyl proton is next to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom, which shifts it far downfield. It is coupled to H(b) in a *trans* configuration. The signal is a doublet with a large coupling constant. This matches **7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n    *   **Proton (b) - H(b):** This vinyl proton is coupled to proton H(c) (creating a doublet) and also coupled to the three protons of the methyl group (a) (creating a quartet). The combination results in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches **5.5 (1H, dq)**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The provided ¹H NMR data is fully consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The number of signals, their chemical shifts, their integrations, and especially the splitting patterns and coupling constants all align perfectly with this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
