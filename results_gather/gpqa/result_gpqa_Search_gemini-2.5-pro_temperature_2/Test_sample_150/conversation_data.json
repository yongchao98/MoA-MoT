    "To determine the probability that a measurement of the observable will yield a result of 0 at time t, the following steps are taken, in accordance with the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the State and Observable:**\n    The state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n    The observable `P` is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n      [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n P = [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n      [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Normalize the State Vector:**\n    A state vector must be normalized for probability calculations. The norm-squared `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is calculated as `(-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalization constant is `1/√6`. Therefore, the normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n3.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Measurement Outcome 0:**\n    The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's matrix. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. This is solved by the eigenvalue equation `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩`, which for `λ = 0` simplifies to `P|v⟩ = 0`.\n    Solving the system of linear equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0`, which means `y = 0`.\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0`, which means `x = -z`.\n    This gives an eigenvector of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. Choosing `x=1`, we get `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    This eigenvector must also be normalized. Its norm-squared is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `0` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the normalized state vector and the corresponding normalized eigenvector. This is given by the formula `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    For the outcome `0`, we calculate:\n    *   `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    *   The inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n        `((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) ⋅ ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1])`\n        `= (1/√12) * ((1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1))`\n        `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    *   The probability is the squared magnitude of this result:\n        `Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value `0` is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
