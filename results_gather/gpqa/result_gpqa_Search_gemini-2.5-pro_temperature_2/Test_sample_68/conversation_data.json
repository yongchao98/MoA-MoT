    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe the decay of particle X⁰, we first need to calculate the typical distance the particle travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. This involves concepts from Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the measurements made in the stationary lab frame (the bubble chamber) to the moving particle's own rest frame. It is calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n    *   Total Energy (E) = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy (m₀c²) = 3.41 GeV\n    *   The formula is E = γ * m₀c²\n    *   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame (τ):** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab. This dilated lifetime (τ) is found by multiplying its proper lifetime (τ₀) by the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Proper Lifetime (τ₀) = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.918 * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 x 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (L):** The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its speed (v) is very close to the speed of light (c, approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   The formula for the average decay length is L = v * τ. A more direct formula is L = γ * β * c * τ₀, where β = v/c. For a highly relativistic particle, β is nearly 1, so we can approximate L ≈ γ * c * τ₀.\n    *   L ≈ 7.918 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n    *   L ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ meters\n\nThe mean decay length, approximately 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m, is the characteristic distance over which most decays will occur. The question asks for the minimum resolution to see *at least 30%* of these decays. The resolution of a detector must be on the same order of magnitude as, or better than, the physical quantity it is intended to measure. In this context, the mean decay length is the most relevant length scale.\n\nAfter a distance equal to one mean decay length (L), approximately 63% of the particles will have decayed. The distance at which exactly 30% of particles have decayed would be slightly shorter (`d = -L * ln(0.7) ≈ 0.357 * L`), but the overall scale of the decay tracks is defined by L.\n\nComparing our calculated value of L ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m with the given options:\n\nA) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\nB) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\nC) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\nD) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\n\nOption A is the closest value to our calculated mean decay length. The slight difference between 1.90 µm and 2.08 µm might stem from slightly different values for physical constants or rounding in the problem's design, but they are clearly in the same order of magnitude and far from the other options. Therefore, a resolution of this scale is required to observe the decay tracks.\n\n<<<A>>>"
