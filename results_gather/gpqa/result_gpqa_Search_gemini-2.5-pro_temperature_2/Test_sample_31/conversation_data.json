    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we must first calculate its rest energy and the Lorentz factor associated with its speed.\n\n**1. Identification of the Nucleus**\nThe nucleus X is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3 (3 protons). Therefore, the mass number of this isotope is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. This identifies the nucleus as Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Rest Mass of Lithium-6**\nThe atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u). The problem concerns the nucleus, so the mass of the three electrons should be subtracted. However, for the precision required, using the atomic mass will suffice and is a common practice in such calculations. The nuclide mass (without electrons) is about 6.0134771 u.\n\n**3. Conversion of Mass to Energy**\nThe energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.4941 MeV/c² or 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n\nThe rest energy (E₀) of the Lithium-6 nucleus is calculated as:\n*   E₀ = 6.015122887 u * 0.9314941 GeV/u\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.6030 GeV\n\n**4. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe speed (v) is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated using the formula:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**5. Calculation of the Total Energy**\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy (E = γ * E₀):\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6030 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.010 GeV\n\nThis calculated value is closest to 20.132 GeV. Let's re-calculate with higher precision to confirm.\n\n*   Rest Mass (m₀): 6.015122887 u\n*   Conversion factor: 1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c² = 0.9314941 GeV/c²\n*   Rest Energy (E₀): 6.015122887 u * 0.9314941 GeV/u ≈ 5.603003 GeV\n*   Lorentz Factor (γ): 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857\n*   Total Energy (E): 3.57142857 * 5.603003 GeV ≈ 20.010725 GeV\n\nRe-evaluating the provided options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 21.419\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nLet's check if the mass of protons and neutrons should be used instead of the nuclide mass.\n*   Mass of 3 protons = 3 * 1.007276 u ≈ 3.021828 u\n*   Mass of 3 neutrons = 3 * 1.008665 u ≈ 3.025995 u\n*   Total mass of constituents = 6.047823 u\nThis value represents the mass before accounting for the binding energy and is not the actual mass of the nucleus.\n\nLet's assume there is a slight variation in the mass or conversion factor used to arrive at one of the options. We can work backwards from the closest answer, C.\n*   If E = 20.132 GeV and γ ≈ 3.5714, then E₀ = E / γ = 20.132 / 3.5714 ≈ 5.6370 GeV.\n*   This rest energy corresponds to a mass of 5.6370 GeV / 0.9314941 GeV/u ≈ 6.0515 u. This value is higher than the known mass of Lithium-6, suggesting this is not the right path.\n\nLet's stick to our calculated value of approximately 20.011 GeV. There seems to be a discrepancy between the calculated energy and the provided options. However, let's re-examine the precision.\n\nFinal Calculation:\n*   Rest Mass (m₀c²): 5.6030 GeV\n*   Lorentz Factor (γ): 3.5714\n*   Total Energy (E): 5.6030 * 3.5714 = 20.0104... GeV.\n\nGiven the options, 20.132 GeV is the closest value. The slight difference (~0.6%) might stem from different accepted values for the physical constants at the time the problem was formulated. Without further information, our calculated result strongly points towards the value range of option C. Let's assume the values in the question lead to option C.\n\nLet's assume the Energy is 20.132 GeV.\nRest Energy (E₀) = Total Energy (E) / γ\nE₀ = 20.132 GeV / 3.57142857 ≈ 5.63696 GeV\nThis would mean the rest mass used to derive the question was approximately 5.63696 / 0.9314941 ≈ 6.0515 u. This is not the standard mass of ⁶Li.\n\nDespite the slight numerical inconsistency, the calculation based on fundamental principles and standard physical constants yields a result very close to option C.\n\nE = (1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)) * 6.015122887 u * 931.4941 MeV/u\nE ≈ 3.5714 * 5603.00 MeV\nE ≈ 20010.7 MeV\nE ≈ 20.011 GeV\n\nThe closest choice is C. There might be a slight inaccuracy in the problem statement's options or the assumed constants.\n\nFinal check of calculation.\nγ = 1 / 0.28 = 3.571428...\nm₀ = 6.015122887 u\nE₀ = 6.015122887 * 0.9314941 = 5.6030033 GeV\nE = γ * E₀ = 3.571428 * 5.6030033 = 20.01072... GeV.\n\nThe result is robustly 20.011 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV. The difference is 0.121 GeV, which is a relative difference of about 0.6%. Given the choices, C remains the most plausible answer, assuming a slight discrepancy in the problem's data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
