    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. This total energy is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interactions between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere ($U_c$).\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual interactions of the 12 charges on the sphere ($U_s$).\n\nFor the total energy to be at a minimum, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This is a well-known problem called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The presence of the central charge does not change this optimal arrangement, as its interaction energy with the shell charges depends only on the fixed radius, not their positions on the sphere.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Constants\n\nFirst, we establish the values of the physical constants and the given parameters:\n*   **Elementary charge (e):** 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   **Particle charge (q):** Each particle has a charge of 2e, so q = 2 × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   **Coulomb's constant (k):** 8.9875517923 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n*   **Sphere radius (r):** 2 m\n\nFrom these, we can calculate the value of $k \\cdot q^2$:\n$k \\cdot q^2 = (8.9875517923 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (3.204353268 \\times 10^{-19})^2$\n$k \\cdot q^2 \\approx 9.22914 \\times 10^{-28} J \\cdot m$\n\n### 2. Calculation of Potential Energy\n\nThe total potential energy (U) is given by:\n$U = U_c + U_s$\n\n**Interaction with Central Charge ($U_c$):**\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance r = 2 m from the central charge.\n$U_c = 12 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{r}$\n\n**Interaction Between Shell Charges ($U_s$):**\nThe 12 charges form an icosahedron. In an icosahedron, the distances between vertices are not all the same. There are three distinct distances between pairs of vertices:\n*   **d₁:** The distance between adjacent vertices (the edge length of the icosahedron). There are 30 such pairs.\n*   **d₂:** The distance between non-adjacent vertices that are not antipodal. There are 30 such pairs.\n*   **d₃:** The distance between opposite (antipodal) vertices. There are 6 such pairs.\n\nThe distances are calculated based on the geometry of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius r:\n*   $d_1 = r \\sqrt{2 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}} \\approx 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{1.10557} \\approx 2.1029$ m\n*   $d_2 = r \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}} \\approx 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2.89443} \\approx 3.4026$ m\n*   $d_3 = 2r = 4$ m\n\nThe total potential energy from these interactions is:\n$U_s = 30 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{d_1} + 30 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{d_2} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{d_3}$\n\n**Total System Energy (U):**\nCombining the two components, the total energy is:\n$U = \\left( 12 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{r} \\right) + \\left( 30 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{d_1} + 30 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{d_2} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{k \\cdot q^2}{d_3} \\right)$\n\nWe can factor out $k \\cdot q^2$:\n$U = k \\cdot q^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{12}{r} + \\frac{30}{d_1} + \\frac{30}{d_2} + \\frac{6}{d_3} \\right)$\n\nPlugging in the values for the distances:\n$U \\approx (9.22914 \\times 10^{-28}) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{12}{2} + \\frac{30}{2.1029} + \\frac{30}{3.4026} + \\frac{6}{4} \\right)$\n$U \\approx (9.22914 \\times 10^{-28}) \\cdot (6 + 14.266 + 8.817 + 1.5)$\n$U \\approx (9.22914 \\times 10^{-28}) \\cdot (30.583)$\n$U \\approx 2.8226 \\times 10^{-26}$ Joules\n\nRounding to three decimal places as required by the format of the options gives 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
