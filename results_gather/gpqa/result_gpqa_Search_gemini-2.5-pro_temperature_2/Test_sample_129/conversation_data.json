    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of objects whose Lyman-alpha absorption can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we must consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** The neutral hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Å. This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, primarily due to ozone (O3). Ground-based telescopes can only observe light within \"atmospheric windows,\" which are ranges of wavelengths that can penetrate the atmosphere. The optical window begins at approximately 3600 Å. Radiation with wavelengths shorter than this is absorbed and cannot be detected from the ground.\n*   **Redshift Formula:** The expansion of the universe stretches the wavelength of light from distant objects. This effect, called redshift (z), is described by the formula:\n    *λ_observed = λ_rest \\* (1 + z)* \n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFor the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable, it must be redshifted to a wavelength that falls within the optical window of ground-based telescopes. The lower limit for redshift corresponds to the minimum wavelength observable from the ground.\n\n1.  **Set the minimum observable wavelength (λ_observed):** We'll use a practical atmospheric cutoff of ~3500-3600 Å. Let's use 3526 Å for this calculation.\n2.  **Set the rest wavelength (λ_rest):** The Lyα line is at 1216 Å.\n3.  **Rearrange the redshift formula to solve for z:**\n    z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n4.  **Substitute the values and calculate:**\n    z = (3526 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    z = 2.9 - 1\n    z = 1.9\n\nA redshift of approximately 1.9 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line to about 3526 Å, making it just barely visible to a ground-based optical telescope. Therefore, this represents the lower limit on the redshift for such detections. Some sources indicate direct ground-based observations are restricted to redshifts of approximately z ≳ 1.7. However, a redshift of around 2 is often cited as the practical point where the Lyα line enters the optical range. Comparing our calculation to the given choices, 1.9 is the most appropriate answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
