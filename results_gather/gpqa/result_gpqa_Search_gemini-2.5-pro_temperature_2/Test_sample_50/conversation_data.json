    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the grounded conducting sphere with an equivalent image charge that replicates the electric field outside the sphere.\n\n### 1. The Method of Image Charges\nA point charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). The effect of the induced charge on the sphere's surface can be modeled by a single image charge, `q'`, located inside the sphere along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are:\n*   **Magnitude (`q'`):** The image charge has a magnitude of `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n*   **Position (`b`):** It is located at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center of the sphere.\n\nThe purpose of this image charge is to ensure that the potential on the surface of the original sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This can also be expressed as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The contribution from the sphere itself is zero because it's grounded (`V=0`).\n\nThe potential created by the induced charge at the location of `q` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location. The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R²/d)]`\n`V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, we can find the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   **A)** `U = -(1/2) * kq² * R / (d² - R²) `\n*   **B)** `U = -kq² * d / (d² - R²) `\n*   **C)** `U = -(1/2) * kq² * d / (d² + R²) `\n*   **D)** `U = -(1/2) * kq² * R² / (d² - R²) `\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
