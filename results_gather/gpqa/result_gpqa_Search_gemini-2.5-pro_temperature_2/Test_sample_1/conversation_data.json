    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde. Its structure is a benzene ring attached to a propenal chain (Ph-CH=CH-CHO). It has 6 carbons in the phenyl ring and 3 carbons in the side chain, for a total of **9 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Reagent:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent. In this reaction, the nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃) from the Grignard reagent attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.\n*   **Product 1:** This reaction results in a secondary alcohol. The original 9 carbons of cinnamaldehyde plus the 1 carbon from the methyl group give a total of **10 carbon atoms**. The product is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol), which has **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group, forming 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one. No carbon atoms are added or removed in this step, so Product 2 also has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one), which has **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, also known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, is a sulfur ylide. It is used to add a methylene group (–CH₂–) to a ketone or aldehyde, forming an epoxide. When reacting with an α,β-unsaturated ketone like Product 2, this specific reagent can form a cyclopropane ring. However, for the purpose of counting carbons, both reaction pathways (epoxidation at the carbonyl or cyclopropanation at the double bond) involve the addition of one carbon atom.\n*   **Product 3:** The reaction adds the one-carbon methylene group from the ylide to the structure of Product 2. Therefore, the total number of carbon atoms in Product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nFinal count:\n*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons\n*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   Product 2: 10 carbons\n*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\n<<<C>>>"
