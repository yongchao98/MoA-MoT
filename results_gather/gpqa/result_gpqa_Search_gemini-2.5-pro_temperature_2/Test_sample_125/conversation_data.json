    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations to determine the correct number of peaks.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-O-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of the ketone group at C3 with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Product Analysis**: The reduction of the carbonyl group (C=O) at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and enantiomerically pure, the hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl is diastereoselective. This means the two faces of the carbonyl are not equivalent, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric alcohols:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    Because the starting material is chiral, these two diastereomers are typically formed in unequal amounts. For the purpose of counting peaks, we have **two distinct products** from Reaction I.\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral beta-diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of both ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Product Analysis**: The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The possible products are isomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Let's analyze the stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they are produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. It is achiral and is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n    Thus, Reaction II produces a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains a total of **five different stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (meso)-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Chiral HPLC**: A chiral stationary phase is designed to distinguish between all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers. Since there are five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral HPLC will separate all of them.\n    *   **Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5**\n\n2.  **Normal-Phase HPLC**: A standard (achiral) normal-phase column separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers**: The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) are constitutional isomers (different molecular formulas and connectivity), so they have very different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n    *   **Diastereomers**: Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and are therefore separable by achiral chromatography.\n        *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will resolve into two separate peaks.\n        *   The meso product from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute separately from them.\n    *   **Enantiomers**: Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated by a normal-phase column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers from Reaction II will co-elute.\n\n    Therefore, the separable species on the normal-phase column are:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  The racemic pair: [(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] (as one peak)\n    4.  (meso)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n    *   **Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 4**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC**: 5 peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC**: 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
