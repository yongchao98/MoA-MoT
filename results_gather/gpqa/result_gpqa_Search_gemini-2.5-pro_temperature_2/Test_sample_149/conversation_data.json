    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound (C₈H₉NO)**\n\nThe molecular formula is C₈H₉NO, and the degree of unsaturation is 5. A benzene ring typically accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, leaving one more, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nLet's analyze the ¹H-NMR data:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic sign of a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield from benzene's 7.26 ppm, suggesting both substituents are electron-donating.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group, which is an electron-donating group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a -CH₂- group. Its doublet (d) splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton.\n\nPutting the fragments together—a para-disubstituted ring, an amino group (-NH₂), and a phenylacetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)—the only possible structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents generate nitrous acid (HONO), which reacts with the primary aromatic amine group (-NH₂) in a diazotization reaction. This converts the amine into a diazonium salt ([-N₂]⁺Cl⁻). The aldehyde group remains unaffected. The intermediate is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n2.  **H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming it causes hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a variation of the Sandmeyer reaction. The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Structure D).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation:** The presence of heat promotes a dehydration (or condensation) reaction. A molecule of water is eliminated from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe intermediate, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, dehydrates by losing the -OH from carbon 3 and the acidic proton from carbon 2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in the final product, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### **Step 3: Compare with Options**\n\n*   **A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** Incorrect. This has phenyl groups instead of hydroxyphenyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   **B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** Incorrect. This molecule only contains one hydroxyphenyl group.\n*   **C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** **Correct.** This matches the expected product from the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   **D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** Incorrect. This is the aldol *addition* product, an intermediate. The \"Heat\" condition drives the reaction to the final *condensation* product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
