  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals a critical error that prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized. This error leads to the conclusion that the ribosome terminates translation prematurely.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:\n\n1.  **Start of Translation:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the correct start codon (Methionine) to initiate protein synthesis.\n2.  **HA Tag Sequence:** The subsequent codons `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` correctly code for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA, which is the sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. This indicates the antigenic determinant portion of the construct is correct.\n3.  **Premature Stop Codon:** Immediately following the HA tag sequence is the codon `AAA` (coding for Lysine), which is followed by `TGA`. In the genetic code, TGA is one of the three stop codons (along with TAA and TAG) that signal the termination of translation.\n4.  **Consequence:** When the ribosome encounters this `TGA` codon, it halts protein synthesis and releases the incomplete polypeptide chain. The resulting product is merely the 1-methionine, 9-amino-acid HA tag, and 1-lysine—far short of the full GADD45G protein. This explains why the expected full-length protein cannot be detected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the other options can be ruled out:\n\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. Stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. Furthermore, the codon in question is TGA, not TAA.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can sometimes improve protein folding and stability, the primary issue here is a complete failure to synthesize the full protein, a more definitive problem than potential degradation.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The HA tag sequence is correctly encoded. The error occurs immediately after it.\n\nTherefore, the unexpected `TGA` codon is responsible for the failed overexpression.\n\n<<<A>>>"
