    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of the substituents on the benzene ring during an electrophilic bromination reaction. The weight fraction of the yield of an isomer is directly proportional to its molar percentage in the product mixture.\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two groups:\n\n1.  **Meta-directing groups:** These are deactivating groups that primarily direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. As a result, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-NO2** (Nitro group in nitrobenzene, 4): This is a very strong deactivating group. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost entirely the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho- and para-isomers.\n    *   **-COOH** (Carboxyl group in benzoic acid, 6): This is a deactivating group. It directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Its deactivating effect is strong, but generally less than the nitro group.\n    *   **-COOC2H5** (Ethyl carboxylate in ethyl benzoate, 2): This ester group is also deactivating and meta-directing, with a deactivating strength comparable to the carboxylic acid group. For nitration, it gives about 5% of the para isomer.\n\n    Among these meta-directing groups, the stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the proportion of the para-product. The order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for nitrobenzene, followed by benzoic acid and then ethyl benzoate. This gives us the beginning of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n2.  **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant for these substances. The substituents in this category are:\n    *   **-CH3** (Methyl group in toluene, 1): This is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. The methyl group is relatively small. The bromination of toluene yields about 67% para-isomer and 33% ortho-isomer.\n    *   **-C2H5** (Ethyl group in ethylbenzene, 5): This is also an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance around the ortho positions favors substitution at the para position. The bromination of ethylbenzene gives about 62% para-isomer. It is important to note that reaction conditions can influence this ratio. Other sources might indicate a higher para yield due to sterics.\n    *   **-Cl** (Chlorine in chlorobenzene, 3): This is a deactivating but ortho-, para-directing group. Halogens tend to give a high percentage of the para-isomer. In the bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is heavily favored, with some sources citing an ortho to para ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which implies around 90% para-product. Nitration, a similar electrophilic substitution, yields 70% para-product for chlorobenzene.\n\n    To order this group, we compare the para-isomer yields. Bromination of ethylbenzene (5) results in about 62% para-isomer. Bromination of toluene (1) results in about 67% para-isomer. Bromination of chlorobenzene (3) leads to an even higher proportion of the para isomer, around 90%. Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield for this group is **5 < 1 < 3**.\n\n**Combining the two groups:**\n\nThe meta-directors (4, 6, 2) will have significantly lower para-isomer yields than the ortho-, para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n*   The order for meta-directors is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n*   The order for ortho-, para-directors is: 5 < 1 < 3.\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 5 < 1 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B, if we swap substances 1 and 5. Let's re-evaluate the ortho/para ratio for Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5).\n- Toluene (1): Para yield is ~67%.\n- Ethylbenzene (5): Para yield is ~62%.\nThis indicates para yield for (1) > (5).\n\nHowever, other sources show that the bulkier the alkyl group, the higher the para/ortho ratio. The tert-butyl group, which is bulkier than ethyl, gives a 75% para yield in nitration, compared to 37% for toluene, suggesting increased steric hindrance favors para substitution. There might be conflicting data depending on reaction conditions. Let's consider the initial analysis based on reported isomer distributions:\n\n1.  C6H5-NO2 (4): Lowest para yield, strong meta-director.\n2.  C6H5-COOH (6): Low para yield, meta-director.\n3.  C6H5-COOC2H5 (2): Low para yield, meta-director, slightly more para than COOH.\n4.  C6H5-C2H5 (5): Moderate para yield, ~62%.\n5.  C6H5-CH3 (1): High para yield, ~67%.\n6.  C6H5-Cl (3): Highest para yield, ~90%.\n\nSo the order is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 5 < 1 < 3. This order does not match any of the options directly. Let's re-examine the provided options and our chemical reasoning.\n\nThe general trend is clear: meta-directors will have lower para yields than ortho-, para-directors. This eliminates option C.\nAmong the meta-directors, the order is based on the strength of the deactivating group: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. This means the para yield should be 4 < 6 < 2. This is consistent with options A and D.\n\nNow let's look at the ortho-, para-directors: -Cl, -CH3, -C2H5. Halogens like -Cl typically give a very high para/ortho ratio. Comparing alkyl groups, increasing steric hindrance (-C2H5 > -CH3) should increase the para/ortho ratio.\n*   -CH3 (1) → less bulky → less para\n*   -C2H5 (5) → more bulky → more para\n*   -Cl (3) → high electronegativity and size lead to high para selectivity.\n\nLet's assume the steric effect for alkyl groups is the dominant factor: para yield of 5 > para yield of 1.\nSo the order among o,p directors would be: 1 < 5 < 3.\nCombined order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. This corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's check option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. This order suggests -COOH is a stronger meta-director than -COOC2H5, and for o,p-directors the para yield is 3 < 1 < 5. This would imply that ethylbenzene gives the most para product of the o,p-directors.\n\nLet's consider the provided options. Both A and D start with the meta-directors ranked in a plausible order based on deactivating strength. The key difference lies in the ranking of the ortho-, para-directors.\n*   Option D: 1 < 5 < 3 (para-yield)\n*   Option A: 3 < 1 < 5 (para-yield)\n\nData for bromination suggests a high para yield for chlorobenzene (3), so an order starting with 3 seems unlikely. Let's reconsider the data for toluene and ethylbenzene. The data showing toluene gives slightly more para-product than ethylbenzene may be specific to certain conditions. The general chemical principle of steric hindrance favoring para-substitution for larger alkyl groups is a strong argument. If we follow this principle, ethylbenzene (5) should give a higher para yield than toluene (1). The high para-directing effect of chlorine (3) is also a well-established trend. Therefore, the most chemically sound ranking based on general principles and a cross-check of data is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\nLet's review the provided options again. None of the options is an exact match to our derived sequence 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3. There must be a subtle point I'm missing or one of the options has a slight variation.\n\nLet's assume the order from option D is correct: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\nThis means the para yields are ordered as: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic Acid < Ethyl Benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\nThis order is very plausible based on established chemical principles:\n*   Meta-directors come first, ordered by their deactivating strength (NO₂ > COOH > COOR).\n*   Ortho/para-directors come next.\n*   Among alkyl groups, the more sterically hindered ethyl group favors the para position more than the methyl group (Para yield: Ethylbenzene > Toluene).\n*   The halogen group (-Cl) is known to strongly favor para substitution.\n\nTherefore, this is the most likely correct order.\n\n<<<D>>>"
