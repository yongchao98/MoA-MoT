    "The sharp decline in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm from a quasar is a distinctive feature known as the Lyman-alpha forest. The peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which has a known rest-frame wavelength of approximately 121.6 nm.\n\nFirst, the redshift (z) of the quasar is determined using the formula:\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nGiven the observed wavelength (λ_observed) of 790 nm and the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyα line (λ_rest) of 121.6 nm, the redshift is calculated as:\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 5.5\n\nNext, using this redshift value and the specified parameters of the Lambda-CDM cosmological model (Hubble constant H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, matter density parameter Ω_M = 0.3, and dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7 for a flat universe), the comoving distance can be calculated. For these cosmological parameters and a redshift of z ≈ 5.5, the comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc.\n\nThis result can be obtained using standard cosmological calculators. For instance, inputting z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ω_M = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7 into a cosmological calculator provides a comoving radial distance of about 8014 Mpc, which is equal to 8.014 Gpc.\n\nTherefore, the assumed value of the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth is 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<D>>>"
