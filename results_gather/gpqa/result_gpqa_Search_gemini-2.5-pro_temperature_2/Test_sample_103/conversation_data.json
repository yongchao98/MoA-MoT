    "Based on the principles of the radial velocity method, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the result:\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity and Wavelength Shift**: The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift, Δλ, is caused by the star's motion, or \"wobble,\" as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet. The magnitude of this wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude, K.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Radial Velocities**: We are given that the periodic wavelength shift for the star hosting planet #1 (Δλ₁) is 5 milliangstroms, and for the star hosting planet #2 (Δλ₂) is 7 milliangstroms. Since K is proportional to Δλ, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n3.  **The Radial Velocity Formula**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K is determined by the following formula:\n    K = (Mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n    where *P* is the orbital period, *Mₚ* is the planet's mass, *Mₛ* is the star's mass, *i* is the orbital inclination, and *G* is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Applying the Given Conditions**: The problem states several key conditions:\n    *   The two stars have identical masses (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n    *   Both orbits are circular.\n    *   Both planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\" as detected by the RV method. This implies that the measured quantity, which is the minimum mass Mₚ sin(i), is the same for both planets (Mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ Mₚ₂ sin(i₂)).\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Relationship**: Because the stellar masses and the planetary minimum masses (Mₚ sin(i)) are equal, these terms cancel out when we compare the two systems. The relationship simplifies to show that the semi-amplitude *K* is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period *P*:\n    K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Period Ratio**: We can express the ratio of the two semi-amplitudes in terms of their periods:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n    Substituting the known values:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
