    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parametrize potential effects of new physics at energy scales higher than the electroweak scale. The operators in SMEFT are required to respect the fundamental symmetries of the SM.\n\nBased on the principles of quantum field theory and the construction of SMEFT, the following symmetries must be respected by all operators:\n\n*   **Lorentz Symmetry:** The laws of physics are independent of the orientation and velocity of the reference frame. All operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz invariant. This is a cornerstone of quantum field theory.\n\n*   **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is a broader symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. The SMEFT Lagrangian is built from local operators that obey Poincaré symmetry.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operations of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, states that any local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT symmetric. As SMEFT is constructed as such a theory, all its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nOn the other hand, **CP symmetry** (the combination of charge conjugation and parity inversion) is known to be violated in the Standard Model, for instance in the weak interactions. SMEFT is designed to be a general effective theory that can accommodate and even introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Consequently, there are numerous studies dedicated to classifying CP-violating operators within SMEFT, demonstrating that CP symmetry is *not* a requirement for all operators.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
