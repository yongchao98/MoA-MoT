    "Based on the chemical puzzle provided, the following deductions can be made to identify the substances and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n*   **Substance B** has a melting point very close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that B is **heavy water**.\n\n*   **Substance X** incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since a product of the overall reaction is heavy water, the isotope in X is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Substance X** and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reducing agents in organic synthesis include lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs, **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄), are also used and would react violently with water.\n\n*   **Gas W**, released from the reaction of X and Y, has an equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. The **Deuterium molecule (D₂)** fits this description, as it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n*   The **reaction of a keto acid with substance X** results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent known to reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to a diol (a compound with two alcohol groups, hence two oxygen atoms). Milder reagents like NaBH₄ would not reduce the carboxylic acid group. This confirms that **X is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   Identifying **liquid Y** and **precipitate G**: For the reaction to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G) that releases heavy water (B) upon heating, Y must be heavy water (D₂O), which reacts violently with LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`\n    *   **Precipitate G** is **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, which is a solid precipitate.\n    *   Upon heating, aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, aluminum deuteroxide) decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water (in this case, heavy water, B). `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n\nWith all substances identified, the final calculation can be performed:\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium).\n*   **Lightest element present:** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest element present:** Aluminum.\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule. This means summing the masses of the four deuterium atoms and the one aluminum atom. Using integer mass numbers for the isotopes:\n*   The mass number of Deuterium (D, or ²H) is 2.\n*   The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n\n**Calculation**:\n*   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as D) = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n*   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n*   **Total Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
