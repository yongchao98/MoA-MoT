    "This is a classic problem involving electrostatic induction and shielding in conductors. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge, `+q`, placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a conductor is that it acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges on the inner surface of the cavity arrange themselves to perfectly cancel the electric field of the charge `+q` for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor material and beyond). Because of this shielding, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is completely independent of the position of the charge inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Outer Charge Distribution:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface of the spherical conductor will spread out uniformly due to mutual repulsion, as it is unaffected by the charges inside the cavity.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point P outside a spherical shell with a uniform surface charge, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere (a consequence of Gauss's Law).\n\nTherefore, the electric field at point P, which is a distance **L** from the center of the spherical conductor, is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface. The field is calculated as if a point charge `+q` were at the conductor's center.\n\nThe formula for the electric field of a point charge is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n\nIn this case, the charge is `q` and the distance is `L`. Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe position of the cavity (`s`), the position of the charge within the cavity, the radius of the cavity (`r`), and the distance from the cavity center to P (`l`) are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
