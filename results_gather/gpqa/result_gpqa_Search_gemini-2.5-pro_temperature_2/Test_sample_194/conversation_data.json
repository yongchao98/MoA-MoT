    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to find the maximum possible semi-major axis for its orbit that still allows for a transit to occur. The conditions for a transit and an occultation are geometrically the same for a circular orbit.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transit Condition**: A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from the observer's point of view. The geometry of a transit is described by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, normalized by the stellar radius (`R_s`). For the center of the planet to pass across the star's disk, the impact parameter `b` must be between 0 and 1. The impact parameter is defined as `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Use Information from Planet 1**: We are given that the first planet has an impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. Using the formula for the impact parameter, we can write a relationship for this planet:\n    `a1 * cos(i) = b1 * R_s = 0.2 * R_s`\n    Here, `a1` is the semi-major axis of the first planet. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, the inclination `i` is the same for both.\n\n3.  **Determine the Limiting Condition for Planet 2**: For the second planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter `b2` must be less than or equal to 1. To find the maximum orbital period, we need to find the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`), which corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter that still constitutes a transit. This limiting value is `b2 = 1`.\n    `a2_max * cos(i) = b2_max * R_s = 1 * R_s`\n\n4.  **Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**: Now we can find the ratio of the maximum semi-major axis of the second planet to the semi-major axis of the first planet:\n    `(a2_max / a1) = (1 * R_s / cos(i)) / (0.2 * R_s / cos(i)) = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n    This shows that the second planet can have a semi-major axis up to 5 times larger than the first planet and still transit its star.\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\n    `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Orbital Period for Planet 2**: We can now solve for the maximum orbital period of the second planet (`P2_max`) using its maximum semi-major axis. We are given that the orbital period of the first planet (`P1`) is 3 days.\n    `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = 3 days * (5)^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = 3 * 5 * sqrt(5)`\n    `P2_max ≈ 3 * 5 * 2.236`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nTherefore, the maximum orbital period of the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The information about the radii of the planets and the star is not needed for this calculation, assuming the standard definition of a transit limit (`b <= 1`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
