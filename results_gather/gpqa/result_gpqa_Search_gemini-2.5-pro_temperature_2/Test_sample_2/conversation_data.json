    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we can calculate the expectation values for `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately and then combine them.\n\nThe spin state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nIn vector notation, this state can be written as:\n`|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe coefficients are `a = 0.5` and `b = √3/2`. The state is normalized since `a² + b² = (0.5)² + ((√3)/2)² = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1`.\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` in the `|↑⟩`, `|↓⟩` basis are:\n*   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σ_z` (`⟨σ_z⟩`)**\n\nThe expectation value of `σ_z` for a state `a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩` is given by `|a|² - |b|²`.\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σ_x` (`⟨σ_x⟩`)**\n\nThe expectation value of `σ_x` is calculated as `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`.\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\nFirst, we multiply the matrix by the column vector:\n`[[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T = [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\nNext, we multiply the row vector by the resulting column vector:\n`[0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T = 0.5 * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * 0.5 = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\nSo, `⟨σ_x⟩ = √3/2`.\n\n**3. Calculate the total expectation value**\n\nThe expectation value of the full operator is `⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`.\n`⟨A⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨A⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives **-0.7**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
