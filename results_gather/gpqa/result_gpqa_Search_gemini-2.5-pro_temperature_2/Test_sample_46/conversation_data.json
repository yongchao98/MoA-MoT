    "### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\nTo identify the correct structure for the compound C9H11NO2, a systematic analysis of the provided molecular formula, IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum is necessary.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as:\n(2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl C=O group).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three protons, is indicative of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (R-COO-CH2-CH3). Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is typical for protons on a heteroatom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino (-NH2) group, while the downfield doublet at ~8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This molecule is a secondary amide, which would show only a single N-H band in the IR spectrum, not two. Its NMR spectrum would also show a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8 ppm and a different aromatic splitting pattern, which contradicts the given data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure is a meta-substituted aromatic ring, which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two distinct doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is consistent with all the available data. It possesses a primary amine (-NH2), which accounts for the two IR bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. It has a conjugated ethyl ester, matching the IR band at 1720 cm-1. The 1H NMR signals for the ethyl group (triplet at 1.20 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm), the primary amine (broad singlet at 4.0 ppm), and the para-substituted aromatic ring (two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm) perfectly match the predicted spectrum for this compound.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This molecule has an ester group, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH3CH2CO-), not attached to the oxygen. This would place the -CH2- quartet at a much lower chemical shift (around 2-3 ppm) in the NMR spectrum, which is not observed.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
