    "The provided reaction sequence is a classic problem in organic synthesis that involves a key rearrangement reaction. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. This occurs by the formation of an enol or enolate intermediate which then attacks the bromine.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**\nWhen 2-halocycloalkanones are treated with a base like sodium hydroxide and heated, they undergo a ring contraction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction proceeds through a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which is then opened by the hydroxide nucleophile to form a five-membered ring. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl produced during the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. The reaction is typically carried out at a low temperature to ensure the aldehyde can be isolated.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the rapid puckering of the cyclopentane ring at room temperature, we can consider its time-averaged symmetry.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (1H):** The proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is one distinct signal.\n2.  **Alpha-Hydrogen (1H):** The single proton on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. This is a second distinct signal.\n3.  **Beta-Hydrogens (4H):** There are two carbons adjacent to the alpha-carbon (at the C2 and C5 positions). On average, these carbons are equivalent due to symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic—meaning they are not equivalent because one is \"cis\" and the other is \"trans\" relative to the aldehyde group. Therefore, the two cis-hydrogens give one signal, and the two trans-hydrogens give another signal. This accounts for two more distinct signals.\n4.  **Gamma-Hydrogens (4H):** The remaining two carbons (at the C3 and C4 positions) are also equivalent to each other by symmetry. Similar to the beta-hydrogens, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in two additional distinct signals.\n\nCounting them up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (alpha) + 2 (beta) + 2 (gamma) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
