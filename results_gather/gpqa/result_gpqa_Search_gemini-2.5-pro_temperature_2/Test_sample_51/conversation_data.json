    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energetic levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate here as the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the populations of two energy levels, N₂ and N₁, is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (kT)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of these levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes, which can be expressed as the ratio without spots (T₁ = 6000 K) divided by the ratio with spots (T₂ = 5500 K).\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / kT₁) - (-ΔE / kT₂) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE) can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is given as 1448 Å. The relationship is ΔE = hc/λ, where 'h' is the Planck constant and 'c' is the speed of light. The product 'hc' is approximately 12400 eV·Å or 1240 eV·nm.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = hc / λ\n    ΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n2.  **Set up the exponent for the factor calculation:**\n    Factor = exp[ (8.5635 eV / 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the terms inside the exponent:**\n    *   (ΔE / k) ≈ 99379 K\n    *   (1/5500 - 1/6000) K⁻¹ ≈ 1.51515 x 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n\n4.  **Calculate the final factor:**\n    Factor = exp[ 99379 * 1.51515 x 10⁻⁵ ]\n    Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThis calculated factor is approximately 4.5. The decrease in temperature from 6000 K to 5500 K results in the population ratio of these two energy levels being about 4.5 times larger in the unspotted star compared to the spotted one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
