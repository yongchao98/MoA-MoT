    "The problem presented is a classic physics exercise in relativistic kinematics, specifically concerning electron-positron annihilation. The core principles required to solve it are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\nFirst, let's establish the initial conditions of the system. We have an electron moving from the left with a Lorentz factor (γ) of 4, and a positron moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Both particles have the same rest mass, denoted as *m_e*.\n\nThe total energy and momentum of a relativistic particle are given by:\n*   Total Energy: E = γ * m * c²\n*   Magnitude of Momentum: p²c² = E² - (mc²)² or p = √(γ² - 1) * m * c\n\n**1. Initial Energy and Momentum:**\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Energy (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_e) = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c. This momentum is directed to the right (positive direction).\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Energy (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_p) = √(2² - 1) * m_e * c = √3 * m_e * c. This momentum is directed to the left (negative direction).\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n    *   Total Momentum (P_initial) = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c. This net momentum is directed to the right.\n\n**2. Final State: Two Photons**\n\nThe annihilation results in two photons. The problem states they have the same energy.\n*   Let the energy of each photon be E_γ.\n*   By the conservation of energy, the total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n    *   E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n    *   2 * E_γ = 6 * m_e * c²\n    *   E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n*   The momentum of a photon is given by p = E / c. Therefore, the momentum of each photon is p_γ = 3 * m_e * c.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum for the Final State**\n\nThe total initial momentum is purely along the horizontal axis. For momentum to be conserved, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. This confirms the description of one photon moving to the \"upper-right\" and the other to the \"lower-right\" at equal angles (θ) above and below the horizontal axis.\n\n*   The total final momentum in the horizontal direction (P_final) is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n    *   P_final = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n    *   Substituting p_γ = 3 * m_e * c, we get: P_final = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n\n*   Now, we apply the conservation of momentum by equating the initial and final total momenta.\n    *   P_initial = P_final\n    *   (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n\n**4. Calculating the Angle**\n\nWe can now solve for the angle θ:\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n*   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This angle is 2θ.\n*   Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to the provided option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
