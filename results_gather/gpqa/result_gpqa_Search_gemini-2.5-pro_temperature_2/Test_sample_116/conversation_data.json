    "The final assessment of the optical isomerism for each compound is as follows:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This compound belongs to the class of substituted biphenyls. Due to the presence of bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups in the ortho-positions (6,6' and 2,2'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image, even though it lacks a traditional chiral carbon atom. This phenomenon of axial chirality makes the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule, the methyl ester of lactic acid, has a carbon atom (at the 2-position) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this stereocenter means the molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), and it is therefore capable of showing optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** In benzophenone, the central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to two phenyl groups. Since there are only three groups attached to this carbon and two of them are identical (the phenyl groups), it does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. The double bond restricts rotation, leading to geometrical isomerism (cis/trans), but not optical isomerism in this case. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
