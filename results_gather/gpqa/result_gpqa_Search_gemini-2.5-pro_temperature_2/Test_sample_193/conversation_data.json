    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z for the given system.\n\nThe system consists of three spins S₁, S₂, and S₃, each can take values +1 or -1. The total number of possible microstates is 2³ = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT):\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nTo calculate Z, we must first find the energy for each of the 8 possible microstates. We can group the states by the number of spins pointing up (+1) and down (-1).\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up** (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    The energy is E₁ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down** (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    The energy is E₂ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\n\nThere are 2 states that have the energy E = -3J.\n\n**Case 2: Two spins are in one direction, and one is in the opposite direction.**\n\n*   **Two spins up, one spin down:**\n    There are three such states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), and (-1, +1, +1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, for instance (+1, +1, -1):\n    E₃ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J.\n    Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all three of these states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n*   **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    There are three such states: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    Let's calculate the energy for one of them, for instance (+1, -1, -1):\n    E₄ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J.\n    Similarly, all three of these states have the same energy, E = J.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states that have the energy E = J.\n\n**Summary of Energy Levels and Degeneracies:**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels:\n1.  Energy E₁ = -3J, with a degeneracy (number of states) g₁ = 2.\n2.  Energy E₂ = J, with a degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\n**Calculation of the Partition Function (Z):**\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by its degeneracy:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
