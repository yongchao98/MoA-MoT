    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of calcium ions:\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([Ca(EDTA)]²⁻) in solution will slightly dissociate into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (EDTA⁴⁻). The equilibrium for this dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    *   Dissociation: [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Constants:**\n    *   The problem provides the formation constant (K_f), which is K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n        K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n    Since K_d is very small, the extent of dissociation 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Finally, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option C. The assumption that the pH is ideal means we can use the given formation constant directly without adjusting for the protonation of EDTA.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
