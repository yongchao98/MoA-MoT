    "The scenario described points to a key process in the maturation of an antibody response within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Here's a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Antigen Delivery to Peyer's Patches:** The rotavirus proteins delivered orally reached the Peyer's patches, which are critical sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens. Peyer's patches are known to constantly sample antigens from the gut to determine if an immune response is needed.\n*   **Proliferating Cells:** The isolation of a \"proliferating cell population\" indicates that lymphocytes (specifically B cells in this context) have recognized the viral protein as a foreign antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion. This proliferation occurs in specialized microenvironments called germinal centers, which are continuously active in Peyer's patches.\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain Gene:** This is the most critical piece of information. The \"variable heavy chain gene\" determines the antigen-binding site of an antibody. An increase in variability or mutation in this specific region during B cell proliferation is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation (SHM). This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. B cells with mutations that improve antibody affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and differentiate further. It is well-documented that B cells in Peyer's patch germinal centers have a very high frequency of somatic mutations.\n\nBased on this, let's evaluate the options:\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process generates the initial B cell receptor diversity in *developing* B cells within the bone marrow, *before* they encounter an antigen. It does not occur in proliferating mature B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ like a Peyer's patch.\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system involving plasma proteins that help clear pathogens, but it does not involve the genetic modification of B cell genes.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation:** This process perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within the Peyer's patch germinal centers after antigen stimulation.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in germinal center B cells, often alongside SHM. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA) and effector function, but it does not alter the *variable* region's sequence or specificity. The question specifically mentions variability in the *variable heavy chain gene*.\n\nTherefore, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cell population is due to somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
