    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total initial energy of the proton and antiproton is converted into the total final energy of the four resulting A particles. The process is:\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_i$)\n\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In the center-of-mass frame, this implies that the initial kinetic energy of the proton and antiproton is negligible compared to their rest mass energy.\n*   The total initial energy is therefore approximately the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n*   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Final Energy ($E_f$) of a Single Particle A\n\n*   According to the law of conservation of energy, the total final energy must equal the total initial energy: $E_f = E_i = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   This total energy is distributed among the four A particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). Due to the symmetry of the outcome, we can assume the energy is shared equally among them.\n*   The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n    $E_A = \\frac{E_f}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 4. Determine the Velocity of Particle A\n\n*   The total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $m_A c^2$ is its rest mass energy and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   We can now calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. We can solve this for the velocity, $v$.\n*   Rearranging the formula: $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n*   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455} = 1 - 0.4089 = 0.5911$\n*   $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the calculated velocity with the given options:\nA) 0.91c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
