    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. The formula for the minimum uncertainty is:\n\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s.\n\nFrom this principle, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp ≈ ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\nΔp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s) / (2 ⋅ 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg⋅m/s\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nSince the electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, while c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The equation is:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nWhere:\n*   E is the total energy.\n*   p is the relativistic momentum.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), we differentiate the energy-momentum equation:\n\nd(E²) = d((pc)²)\n2E dE = 2p c² dp\nΔE ≈ (pc²/E) ⋅ Δp\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the total energy is E = γm₀c² and the momentum is p = γm₀v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the expression for ΔE gives:\n\nΔE ≈ ( (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) ) ⋅ Δp\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\nThis shows that the uncertainty in energy is approximately the product of the particle's velocity and the uncertainty in its momentum.\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow we can substitute the known values for v and the calculated Δp into this equation:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg⋅m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe estimated minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, which is on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
