    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\nThe experiment involves heating an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight of this tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to copper reacting with an oxygen-containing gas. Given the likely decomposition products of nitrogen-based salts, this gas is either O₂ or N₂O (nitrous oxide). In either case, the mass gain is due to oxygen atoms.\n    *   Reaction with O₂: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Reaction with N₂O: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂\n    *   The mass of oxygen that reacted is 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 L of a remaining gas (C) was collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This is an inert gas, which points to nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Salts\n\nThe decomposition products are water (H₂O), nitrogen (N₂), and an oxide of nitrogen (N₂O) or elemental oxygen (O₂). The elements present in the original salts are Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). This strongly suggests that the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We have an equimolar mixture, meaning moles of Salt A = moles of Salt B = *n*.\n\n**Decomposition Reactions:**\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposes upon heating to produce nitrogen gas and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate decomposes at 200°C to produce nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water:\n    NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's assume **Salt A is NH₄NO₂** and **Salt B is NH₄NO₃**.\nFrom *n* moles of each salt, the products would be:\n*   From NH₄NO₂: *n* mol of N₂ and 2*n* mol of H₂O.\n*   From NH₄NO₃: *n* mol of N₂O and 2*n* mol of H₂O.\n\n**Total products:**\n*   Total Moles of H₂O = 2*n* + 2*n* = 4*n*.\n*   Total Moles of N₂ = *n*.\n*   Total Moles of N₂O = *n*.\n\nNow let's match this with the experimental results.\n1.  **Water:** The experiment yielded 0.20 mol of H₂O. So, 4*n* = 0.20 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**.\n2.  **Tube 3 Reaction:** The N₂O produced reacts with hot copper, depositing oxygen and releasing nitrogen gas (N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂).\n    *   *n* moles of N₂O contain *n* moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   From the experiment, moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, **n = 0.05 mol**.\n3.  **Final Gas C:** The total N₂ collected is the sum of N₂ produced directly from NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = (N₂ from NH₄NO₂) + (N₂ from N₂O) = *n* + *n* = 2*n*.\n    *   The experiment yielded 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C). So, 2*n* = 0.10 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\nAll three calculations consistently give **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\n### 3. Verification of Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the starting mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g.\n\nThis matches the initial weight of 7.20 g. The identification of the salts as ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate is correct.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of Salt A and one formula unit of Salt B.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in A) + 9 (in B) = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
