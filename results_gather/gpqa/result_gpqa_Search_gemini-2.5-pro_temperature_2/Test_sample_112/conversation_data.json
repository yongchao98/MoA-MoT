    "### Decoding the Molecular Structure\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound's chemical formula can be identified by systematically interpreting the results from each characterization technique.\n\n**Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This, combined with the O-H peak, further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond within the molecule. Vinyl protons typically show signals in the 4.5 to 7 ppm range.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation, which is a common and diagnostic fragment for this functional group.\n\n**Identifying the Correct Formula:**\n\nThe combined data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a C=C double bond). A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This information immediately rules out options C₆H₁₂O and C₆H₁₀O, as they only have one oxygen atom each.\n\nThe remaining possibilities are C₆H₁₀O₂ and C₆H₁₂O₂. To differentiate between these, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   A C=C double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n*   The C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group also contributes one degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the target molecule must have a total of at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation for C₆H₁₀O₂ is 2, which perfectly matches the requirements of having one C=C double bond and one C=O double bond. The DoU for C₆H₁₂O₂ is only 1, which is inconsistent with the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data all point to a molecule containing a carboxylic acid and an alkene group. The analysis of the degrees of unsaturation confirms that the only possible molecular formula that fits all the evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
