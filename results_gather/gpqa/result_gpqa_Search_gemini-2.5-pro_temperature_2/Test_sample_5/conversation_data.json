    "To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle in the given potential, the potential should first be converted from polar to Cartesian coordinates. The search results confirm that for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, solving the problem in Cartesian coordinates is a standard approach that separates the problem into two independent one-dimensional oscillator problems.\n\nThe potential is given as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nUsing the transformations x = r cos(θ) and r^2 = x^2 + y^2, we can rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential describes a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The total potential is a sum of two independent potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\nV(x, y) = V(x) + V(y)\nwhere V(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2 and V(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is therefore separable, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nFor a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form U = 1/2 mω^2x^2, the energy eigenvalues are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of these two energies:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
