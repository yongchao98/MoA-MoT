    "Based on the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Here is a breakdown of how each piece of information leads to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The additional peak at m/z = 158, which has an intensity of about one-third of the main peak (32%), is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened by hydrogen bonding. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of the carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:** The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is indicative of a highly deshielded proton, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The two doublets in the aromatic region, at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), suggest a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two sets of equivalent protons split each other into doublets.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a *para*-substituted benzene ring containing a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. Its molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol, which matches the mass spectrum. The carboxylic acid functional group aligns perfectly with the IR data. The *para*-substitution pattern explains the two doublets for two protons each in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound lacks a carboxylic acid, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct formula and functional group, the *ortho*-substitution pattern would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acyl chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid, and lacks an acidic proton, which is inconsistent with both the IR and NMR spectra.\n\nTherefore, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only option that fits all the provided spectral evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>"
