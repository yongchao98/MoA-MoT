    "The answer can be determined by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the law of radioactive decay. The solution does not require all the specific values given, but relies on the proportions and the relationships between the physical quantities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Particle Survival Probability:** The fraction of particles, *f*, that survive after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    *f = exp(-t / τ)*\n    where *τ* is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a relativistic particle is dilated in the observer's (laboratory) frame. It relates to the proper lifetime *τ₀* (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor *γ*:\n    *τ = γτ₀*\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time *t* it takes for them to travel the detector radius *R* is:\n    *t ≈ R / c*\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** By substituting the expressions for *τ* and *t* into the survival probability equation, we get:\n    *f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ₀)) = exp(-R / (γcτ₀))*\n\n### Applying the Conditions:\n\n**Initial Condition:**\n*   One-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n*   The Lorentz factor is *γ₁ = 20*.\n*   So, *f₁ = 1/3*.\n\nPlugging these values into our combined formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * cτ₀))`\n\nTo solve this, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * cτ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (20 * cτ₀)`\nThis gives us a relationship: `R / (cτ₀) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n**Goal Condition:**\n*   We want two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, *γ₂*.\n*   So, *f₂ = 2/3*.\n\nPlugging these new values into the formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * cτ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * cτ₀)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -R / (γ₂ * cτ₀)`\nWhich gives us another relationship: `R / (cτ₀) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n\n### Solving for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n\nNow we have two expressions for the same constant term `R / (cτ₀)`, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nFinally, we solve for *γ₂*:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
