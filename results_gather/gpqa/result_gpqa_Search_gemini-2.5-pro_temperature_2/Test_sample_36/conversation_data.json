    "The number of ¹³C-NMR signals produced by the final product, E, is determined by its chemical structure and symmetry. The series of reactions is as follows:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to form a protective dithioacetal, resulting in 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane (A).\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) of the dithiolane ring, forming a lithiated carbanion (B).\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The carbanion (B) acts as a nucleophile, attacking bromoethane to add a second ethyl group at the C2 position. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane (C).\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: The dithiolane group is removed (deprotected) to reveal a carbonyl group. Since the C2 carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) (D).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This final step is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, a Wittig reagent (ylide) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr). BuLi is used to deprotonate the phosphonium salt to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The oxygen atom of the ketone's carbonyl group is swapped with the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   The final product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals for **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, we must examine its structure for symmetry. The molecule (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ is highly symmetrical.\n\nThe unique carbon environments are:\n*   The four methyl (–CH₃) groups are all chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n*   The four methylene (–CH₂–) groups are also chemically equivalent. This gives a **second signal**.\n*   The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are equivalent to each other, producing a **third signal**.\n\nBecause of its high degree of symmetry, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene has only three distinct carbon environments, and therefore it will produce 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
