    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2, and for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n*   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass percentage of hydrogen is calculated as:\n    Mass % H = (Total mass of H / Total molar mass) × 100 = (2n × 1.008) / (12.011n + 2.016n) × 100 ≈ (2 / 14) × 100 ≈ 14.3%. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the percentage is (2n / 14n) × 100 = 14.2857%. This is a strong match.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent that does not react further with hydrogen, which is consistent with it being a saturated cycloalkane. A common example is cyclohexane.\n*   Let's verify with **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**:\n    *   Mass % H = (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) × 100 ≈ 14.37%. Using integer masses: (12 / 84) × 100 = 14.2857%.\n*   Given that both mixtures X and Y yield *only* Z upon severe hydrogenation, all constituent compounds must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X when heated with platinum. This type of reaction, known as Zelinaky irreversible catalysis, typically involves an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionating into its fully saturated (cycloalkane) and fully dehydrogenated (aromatic) forms.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   The other component must also yield cyclohexane upon severe hydrogenation. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is a liquid that does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, which means they are unsaturated.\n*   Upon heating with platinum, mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene). The reaction is as follows:\n    **Liquid 1 (from X) + Liquid 2 (from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)**\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Both liquids in X must be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Ha and C₆Hb.\n*   By balancing the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n    a + b = 12 + 6\n    **a + b = 18**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is exactly this sum (a + b).\n*   To confirm this is a chemically sound scenario, we can identify plausible structures for the two liquids in X. They must be unsaturated, have a six-membered ring, and contain no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A possible candidate for C₆Ha is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. It has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   This means C₆Hb must be **C₆H₈**. This is a cyclohexadiene. There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the second liquid must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2 hydrogens), and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2 hydrogens). This is a balanced and known type of catalytic reaction.\n*   Finally, the hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene) would indeed produce only cyclohexane, which is consistent with all the given information.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these liquids is:\n10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
