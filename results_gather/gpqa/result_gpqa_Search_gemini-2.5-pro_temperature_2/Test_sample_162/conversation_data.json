    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH of the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Volume of Strong Acid Needed\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** Iron(III) hydroxide, a base, reacts with a strong monobasic acid (like HCl) in a neutralization reaction. The balanced net ionic equation is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol\n\n3.  **Determine Moles of Acid (H⁺):**\n    *   According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume of the 0.1 M Acid:**\n    *   Volume = Moles / Concentration\n    *   Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n    *   To convert this to cubic centimeters (cm³), multiply by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³).\n    *   Volume = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nComparing this calculated volume with the options provided, 28.07 cm³ is very close to 28.05 cm³ in option D.\n\n### Part 2: pH of the Resulting Solution\n\n1.  **Formation of Fe³⁺ Ions:** The dissolution process creates iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) in the solution.\n2.  **Hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:** In an aqueous solution, the Fe³⁺ ion exists as a hexaaqua complex, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺. This complex ion is acidic because the high charge density of the Fe³⁺ ion weakens the O-H bonds of the surrounding water molecules, causing the complex to donate a proton (H⁺) to the solution.\n3.  **Hydrolysis Equation:** The hydrolysis reaction is:\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n4.  **Calculate the Concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The moles of Fe³⁺ formed are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃, which is 0.0009357 mol.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is given as 100 cm³ or 0.1 L.\n    *   Initial Concentration of [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   To find the pH, we use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion. The pKa for this ion is approximately 2.2.\n    *   The relationship between Ka and pKa is: Ka = 10⁻ᵖᴷᵃ.\n    *   Ka = 10⁻²² ≈ 6.31 x 10⁻³\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression: Ka = [H⁺][Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)²⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium: Ka = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n    *   6.31 x 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009357 - x)\n    *   This requires solving a quadratic equation: x² + (6.31 x 10⁻³)x - (5.90 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n    *   Solving for x (the [H⁺] concentration) using the quadratic formula gives x ≈ 0.00516 M.\n    *   Calculate the pH: pH = -log[H⁺]\n    *   pH = -log(0.00516) ≈ 2.29\n\nThe calculated pH of ~2.29 is close to the pH of 2.04 given in option D. The difference can be attributed to using a more precise pKa value or considering further hydrolysis steps, but 2.29 is significantly closer to 2.04 than to the pH values in the other options.\n\nBoth the calculated volume (28.07 cm³) and pH (~2.29) strongly point towards option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
