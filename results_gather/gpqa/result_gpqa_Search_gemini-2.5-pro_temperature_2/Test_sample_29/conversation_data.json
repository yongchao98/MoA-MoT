    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the *emitted* light.** The relationship between energy (E), Planck's constant (h), the speed of light (c), and wavelength (λ) is E = hc/λ. A convenient form of this equation for calculations involving electron volts (eV) and nanometers (nm) is λ ≈ 1240 eV·nm / E.\n    *   Given E = 2.3393 eV\n    *   λ_emitted ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm.\n\n2.  **Identify the color of the *emitted* light.** A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Relate emitted light to absorbed light.** When a substance fluoresces, it first absorbs a photon of light, which excites it to a higher energy state. It then loses some energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations) before emitting a photon of lower energy to return to its ground state. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift. Therefore, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.\n\n4.  **Determine the color of the *absorbed* light.** Since the compound emits green light (~530 nm), it must absorb light with a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Looking at the options and the visible spectrum (from longer to shorter wavelength: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet):\n    *   Red and Yellow have longer wavelengths and lower energies than green light.\n    *   Blue and Violet have shorter wavelengths and higher energies.\n    *   Blue light has a wavelength range of approximately 450–495 nm, corresponding to a higher energy of about 2.5–2.75 eV. Violet light has an even shorter wavelength and higher energy.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.** The compound absorbs light at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the green light it emits. Of the choices provided, Blue is the color with the next highest energy compared to green. A molecule that absorbs blue light often emits light in the green region of the spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is blue.\n\n<<<B>>>"
