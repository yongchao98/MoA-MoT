    "To determine the energies of the system, we must consider the quantum states of the four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as E_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ... are the principal quantum numbers.\n\nFor each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin-up (↑) and spin-down (↓). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Energy Level n=1 (E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Level n=2 (E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### First Excited State Energy\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (E₃ = 3²E = 9E).\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1 (Energy: 2 × 1E)\n*   One particle in n=2 (Energy: 1 × 4E)\n*   One particle in n=3 (Energy: 1 × 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next-lowest energy configuration. There are two possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Move the second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n2.  Move one particle from a lower level (n=1) to the next available level (n=3). The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lower energy is 18E. Thus, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
