    "To determine the suitable reagents for the given reactions, let's analyze each step.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophile, cyanide ion (⁻CN), from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. For the reaction to complete and form the final cyanohydrin product, a proton source is needed to protonate the oxygen of the alkoxide intermediate. Often, HCN is generated *in situ* by adding a strong acid to NaCN. The H₃O⁺ from a strong acid like HCl provides the necessary proton for this step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. The options for reagent B are HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid). While both are acids, the hydrolysis of nitriles is typically carried out with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) under heat to ensure the reaction proceeds to completion. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** is **H₃O⁺**\n*   **B** is **HCl**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
