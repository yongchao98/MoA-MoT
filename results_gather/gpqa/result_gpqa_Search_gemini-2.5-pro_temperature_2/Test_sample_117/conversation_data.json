    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a classic example of alpha-halogenation. The starting molecule, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the enol tautomer of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe mechanism for this reaction involves the following steps:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine (Br₂).\n2.  A new carbon-bromine bond is formed at the alpha-position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is C2 in this case).\n3.  An oxonium ion intermediate is formed.\n4.  This intermediate is then deprotonated to regenerate the stable carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nThis process results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom at the alpha-carbon with a bromine atom, yielding an α-bromoketone. In this specific reaction, the product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This type of reaction, when catalyzed by acid, typically results in a single halogenation.\n\n*   Options A and C, `(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol` and `(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol`, describe products of a dihalogen addition across the double bond, which is not the favored pathway for an enol. The enol chemistry strongly favors regeneration of the carbonyl, leading to a substitution rather than an addition product.\n*   Option B, `4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone`, is incorrect as the bromination occurs at the α-carbon (position 2 or 5), not at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the major outcome is the alpha-bromination product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
