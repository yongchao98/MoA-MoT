    "This problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched from the +Z direction to the +Y direction, the spin of the particle begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. In quantum mechanics, this means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the z-axis. The expectation value of its spin is pointing entirely along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **The Change:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is abruptly changed to the +Y direction. Due to this sudden change, the spin orientation of the particle doesn't have time to adjust and is still pointing along the +Z direction at the moment the new field is applied.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession:** A magnetic moment (and the associated spin) placed in a magnetic field will experience a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. In this case, the spin, which initially points along the z-axis, will begin to precess around the y-axis.\n\n4.  **Oscillation of the Z-Component:** As the spin vector precesses around the y-axis, its components in the x and z directions will oscillate. The tip of the spin vector traces a circle in the x-z plane. The projection of this circular motion onto the z-axis is a sinusoidal oscillation.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Frequency:** The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency. Both a detailed quantum mechanical calculation and the semi-classical model of a precessing magnetic moment yield the same angular frequency (`ω`) for this oscillation. The Bohr frequency of an observable in a two-level system is determined by the energy difference between the two states, which also leads to the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio (`γ`) of the particle and the magnitude of the magnetic field (`B`).\n\nThe formula for the Larmor angular frequency (`ω`) is:\n`ω = γ * B`\n\nThe average value of the z-component of the magnetic moment will, therefore, oscillate with this frequency. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct one is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
