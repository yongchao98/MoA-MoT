    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting material and product for the given Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangements.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is a ketone, specifically a cyclohexanone, with two *p*-tolyl groups on the carbon atom adjacent (at the C2 position) to the carbonyl group (C1).\n2.  **Recall the Reaction:** The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement converts a 1,2-diol into a ketone or aldehyde. The mechanism involves the protonation of a hydroxyl group, its departure as water to form a carbocation, followed by a 1,2-rearrangement.\n3.  **Consider Starting Material 'A':** The options propose two possibilities for A: `1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol` or the analogous cyclohexanol derivative.\n4.  **Evaluate the Cyclopentanol Derivative (`1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol`):**\n    *   This molecule has two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons: one on the cyclopentane ring (a tertiary alcohol) and one on the exocyclic carbon (also a tertiary alcohol).\n    *   Under acidic conditions, an OH group is protonated and leaves as water. The OH group that leaves is the one that forms the most stable carbocation. The carbocation formed by the loss of the exocyclic OH is stabilized by two phenyl (tolyl) rings, making it exceptionally stable.\n    *   The formation of this stable carbocation drives a 1,2-shift of an adjacent bond. In this case, a C-C bond from the cyclopentane ring migrates to the electron-deficient carbon.\n    *   This migration results in a **ring expansion**, converting the five-membered cyclopentane ring into a more stable six-membered cyclohexane ring. The carbon that was C1 of the cyclopentane ring becomes the new carbocation center, which is stabilized by the attached OH group and rearranges to form the ketone. The carbon bearing the two tolyl groups becomes C2 of the newly formed cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This sequence correctly produces 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one.\n5.  **Evaluate the Cyclohexanol Derivative (`1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol`):**\n    *   By the same logic, a ring expansion of this starting material would result in a seven-membered cycloheptanone ring, which does not match the product given.\n6.  **Conclusion for 'A':** The starting material A must be **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting material is `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`. It has two hydroxyl groups: one secondary (at C3) and one tertiary (at C2).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Pathway:** The reaction path depends on which hydroxyl group leaves to form the most stable carbocation intermediate.\n    *   **Path 1 (Carbocation at C2):** If the tertiary OH at C2 leaves, a tertiary carbocation is formed. While tertiary, it is adjacent to a strongly electron-withdrawing ester group (`-COOCH₃`), which is destabilizing.\n    *   **Path 2 (Carbocation at C3):** If the secondary OH at C3 leaves, a secondary carbocation is formed.\n3.  **Evaluate Migratory Aptitudes:**\n    *   The migratory aptitude determines which group shifts during the rearrangement. The general order is often cited as Aryl > Hydride (H) > Alkyl. Electron-donating groups like *p*-tolyl enhance the migratory aptitude of the aryl group.\n4.  **Identify the Product 'B':** Although forming a carbocation next to an ester is unfavorable, if we follow the pathway that leads to the options provided:\n    *   Assume the carbocation forms at C2 (stabilized by the *p*-tolyl group). The adjacent C3 has a hydrogen and a methyl group.\n    *   A 1,2-hydride shift occurs, as hydrogen has a greater migratory aptitude than the methyl group.\n    *   The hydride moves from C3 to C2, and the positive charge moves to C3. This charge is then stabilized by the oxygen of the OH group, which rearranges to form a ketone at C3.\n    *   The resulting product is `CH₃-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃`.\n5.  **Name the Product 'B':** The systematic name for `CH₃-C(=O)-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH₃` is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol**.\n*   Product **B** is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
