    "The scribbled note on your colleague's desk provides a crucial clue for determining the number of loops in the Feynman diagram. The expression, `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`, contains several components, but the most revealing for the loop order is the factor of `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations, particularly in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a specific factor after integrating over the loop momentum. When using dimensional regularization, a standard technique to handle the infinities that arise in these integrals, each loop contributes a factor of `1/(16π²)`, which is equivalent to `1/(4π)²`, to the final amplitude.\n\nTherefore, an expression for a diagram with *L* loops will typically be proportional to `(1/(4π)²)^L`, or `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nBy comparing this general formula to the term in your colleague's notes, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for *L* gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThis indicates that the Feynman diagram your colleague was studying contained three loops. The other factors in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3` and `g^2`), numerical factors (`sqrt(2)` and `8`), and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the specific particles, interactions, and kinematics of the process, but the power of `4π` is a direct consequence of the number of loop integrations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
