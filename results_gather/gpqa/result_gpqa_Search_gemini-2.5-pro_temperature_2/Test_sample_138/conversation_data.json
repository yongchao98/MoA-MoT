    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water is a well-established method for the synthesis of α-diketones (1,2-diketones). This reaction proceeds through the α-oxidation of the ketone.\n\nThe process involves the following key steps:\n1.  In the presence of acid, sodium nitrite forms nitrous acid (HONO), which then generates the nitrosonium ion (NO+).\n2.  The starting ketone undergoes acid-catalyzed enolization.\n3.  The enol, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic nitrosonium ion at the α-carbon. This step is called nitrosation.\n4.  This forms an α-nitroso ketone, which tautomerizes into a more stable mono-oxime.\n5.  Finally, the acidic aqueous conditions facilitate the hydrolysis of the oxime to yield the final 1,2-diketone product.\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the starting material must be a ketone with at least one hydrogen atom on an α-carbon.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A: Synthesis of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\nThe product is a cyclic α-diketone. To form this 1,2-dione via the described reaction, the starting material must be a ketone. The oxidation will occur at the carbon atom adjacent to the initial carbonyl group.\n*   **Starting Material A:** 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone. It has α-hydrogens at both the C2 and C6 positions. The reaction with NaNO2 and HCl will introduce a second carbonyl group at one of these positions. Introducing the carbonyl at the C2 position yields the desired product, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. The other options, which involve an alcohol or a diol, are incorrect because this specific reaction begins with a ketone.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B: Synthesis of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\nThe product is an acyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at the C2 and C3 positions.\n*   **Starting Material B:** To form this 2,3-dione, the reaction must start with a ketone that has a carbonyl group at either C2 or C3.\n    *   **5-methylhexan-2-one** has a carbonyl group at C2. Its α-carbons are at C1 and C3. Oxidation at the C3 position will produce 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This fits the required transformation. In the case of unsymmetrical ketones, nitrosation tends to occur at the more-substituted carbon atom. For 5-methylhexan-2-one, the C3 position is more substituted than the C1 position, favoring the formation of the 2,3-dione.\n    *   **5-methylhexane-2,3-diol** is an alcohol and would not undergo this specific reaction to form the diketone.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reaction mechanism for both transformations, the correct starting materials are a ketone in each case. Therefore, A is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one and B is 5-methylhexan-2-one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
