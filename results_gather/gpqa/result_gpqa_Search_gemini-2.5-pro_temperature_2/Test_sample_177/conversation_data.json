    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to establish the mass dimensions of each component in the Lagrangian term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). In natural units (where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\)), the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}\\) is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴ to compensate.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the fields are determined from their kinetic terms in the full Lagrangian:\n*   **Fermion field ψ:** The kinetic term for a fermion is \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). For the Lagrangian to have a mass dimension of 4, \\([\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]\\) + [∂] = 4. Since the derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a mass dimension of 1, this implies \\([\\bar{\\psi}\\psi]\\) = 3. As \\([\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]\\), we find that \\(2[\\psi] = 3\\), so the mass dimension of a fermion field is \\([\\psi]_M = 3/2\\).\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor F<sup>μν</sup>:** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have \\(2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4\\), which means the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is \\([F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2\\).\n*   **Sigma tensor σ<sub>μν</sub>:** The term \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]\\) is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless constant matrices. Therefore, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless, \\([\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0\\).\n\nNow, we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ. The interaction term \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) must have a mass dimension of 4:\n\\[[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4\\]\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n\\[[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa]_M = -1\\]\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\nNext, we address the renormalizability of the theory. According to the principle of power-counting renormalizability, a theory is considered non-renormalizable if any of its coupling constants has a negative mass dimension. Theories with dimensionless coupling constants ([g]_M = 0) are typically strictly renormalizable, and those with positive mass dimension couplings ([g]_M > 0) are super-renormalizable. Since we found that \\([\\kappa]_M = -1\\), which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is non-renormalizable.\n\nThus, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
