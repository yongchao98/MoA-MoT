    "To determine the maximum speed ($v_{max}$) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Define the System and Total Energy:** The system consists of a mass *m* attached to a spring. The total energy ($E_{total}$) of this system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy of the spring. The relativistic energy of the particle is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. The potential energy ($U$) from Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) is $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A):** At the point of maximum displacement, or amplitude A, the mass is momentarily at rest ($v=0$).\n    *   At this point, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is 1 (since $v=0$).\n    *   The particle's energy is just its rest energy, $mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is constant and given by:\n        $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. This is a conserved quantity throughout the oscillation.\n\n3.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0):** The mass reaches its maximum speed ($v_{max}$) when it passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is zero ($U=0$).\n    *   The particle's energy is its full relativistic energy at maximum velocity: $E_{particle} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   At this position, the total energy of the system is equal to the particle's energy:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate and Solve for v_max:** By the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    *   $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation. First, invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
