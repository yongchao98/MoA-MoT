    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we need to calculate the effects of time dilation based on Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Determine the Distance:**\nThe destination is Earth, and the origin is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n**2. Calculate Time from an Earth Observer's Perspective:**\nFirst, we calculate how long the journey would take from the perspective of a stationary observer, such as one on Earth.\n\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n\nThe time (Δt) measured by the Earth observer is the distance divided by the speed. Since the speed is extremely close to the speed of light, this time is just slightly over 163,000 years.\n*   Δt = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 163,000.02 years.\n\n**3. Calculate the Time for the Astronaut (Time Dilation):**\nDue to the effects of time dilation, time passes more slowly for the astronaut traveling at relativistic speeds. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt' = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   **Δt'** is the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time).\n*   **Δt** is the time measured by the stationary observer on Earth (163,000.02 years).\n*   **v** is the spacecraft's speed (0.99999987 * c).\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term inside the square root:\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² ≈ 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can find the astronaut's time:\n*   Δt' = 163,000.02 years * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.11 years\n\nThis result is closest to 81 years among the given choices. Minor variations in the exact distance to the LMC (which can range from 160,000 to 179,000 light-years) would slightly alter the result, but it remains in the same range. For instance, using a distance of 160,000 light-years yields a travel time of approximately 81.6 years.\n\n**4. Astronaut's Age and Survival:**\nThe journey would take approximately 81-83 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n*   **Astronaut's age at departure:** 22 years\n*   **Time elapsed during the trip:** ~81 years\n*   **Astronaut's age upon arrival:** 22 + 81 = 103 years\n\nSince the alien's average lifetime is 150 years, the astronaut would survive the journey, making option C incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the approximate time the journey takes from the astronaut's point of view is 81 years.\n\n<<<A>>>"
