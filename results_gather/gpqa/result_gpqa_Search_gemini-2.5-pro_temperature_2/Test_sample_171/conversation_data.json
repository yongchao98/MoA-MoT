    "The search results confirm that my initial reasoning based on the Boltzmann equation is correct.\n\n*   **Boltzmann Equation**: The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states of atoms to the temperature of the gas. Specifically, for a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower state (N_a) is given by: N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / kT). This is the foundational principle for solving the problem.\n*   **Application to Stars**: The search results show this equation is standardly applied to stellar atmospheres to relate the strengths of spectral lines to temperature. Comparing the same spectral line in two different stars to determine temperature differences is a valid technique.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Excitation\"**: The phrase \"twice as excited\" is reasonably interpreted as the ratio of the population in the excited state relative to the ground state (or total number of atoms) being twice as large in star 1 as in star 2. The searches support using ratios of atom populations in different states to characterize the excitation level as a function of temperature.\n\nThe derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  **State the Boltzmann Equation for each star:** Let N_e and N_g be the number of atoms in the excited state and ground state, respectively. Let g_e and g_g be their statistical weights. The energy difference is E.\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1): (N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-E / (k * T_1))\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2): (N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-E / (k * T_2))\n\n2.  **Use the given information:** We are told that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2.\n    *   (N_e / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_e / N_g)_2\n\n3.  **Combine the equations:**\n    *   (g_e / g_g) * exp(-E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_e / g_g) * exp(-E / (k * T_2))\n    *   The statistical weight term (g_e / g_g) cancels out.\n    *   exp(-E / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-E / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Solve for the temperatures:**\n    *   exp(-E / (k * T_1)) / exp(-E / (k * T_2)) = 2\n    *   exp[ (E/k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n    *   exp[ (E/k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = 2\n\n5.  **Take the natural logarithm of both sides:**\n    *   ln(2) = (E/k) * (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n6.  **Substitute the given values:** The problem states that E ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K.\n    *   Therefore, E/k ≈ 1.\n    *   ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
