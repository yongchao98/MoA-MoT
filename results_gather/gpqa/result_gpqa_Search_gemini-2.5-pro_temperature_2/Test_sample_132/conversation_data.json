    "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must perform a series of equilibrium calculations.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Molar Concentrations\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each compound dissolved in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n\nNext, we find the initial concentrations of the H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions in the solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe solution is a buffer composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸**\n\nWe can rearrange the acid dissociation constant expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n\nKa₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced by the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This is the third dissociation step for phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₃.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²**\n\nUsing the equilibrium constant expression for Ka₃, we can solve for the [PO₄³⁻]:\n\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
