    "Regularization is a technique used in physics to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly at very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances). When a theory yields infinite values for physical quantities, regularization introduces a parameter, known as a cutoff, to make these calculations manageable and finite. Let's examine each of the proposed theories:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD describes the strong nuclear force. Perturbative calculations in QCD lead to ultraviolet divergences, which are infinities occurring at high energies. To deal with these, techniques like dimensional regularization and lattice QCD are employed to regulate the theory. Therefore, QCD requires regularization at high energies.\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum theory, classical electrodynamics faces its own issues with infinities. The self-energy of a point-like electron, for instance, is infinite. This high-energy problem requires a form of regularization, such as assuming the electron has a small but finite size instead of being a true mathematical point.\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED, the quantum theory of electromagnetism, was one of the first theories where the need for regularization and the subsequent process of renormalization became apparent. Calculations involving loop diagrams, which represent particle self-interactions, diverge at high energies. Regularization methods are essential to isolate these infinities so they can be absorbed into physical quantities, yielding finite results that agree with experiments.\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that aims to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces. One of its key features is the proposition that it is free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. This is because fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature smooths out the interactions at short distances, which is believed to prevent the infinities from appearing in the first place. While regularization techniques may be used for specific calculations within the theory, superstring theory is fundamentally believed not to require regularization for high-energy infinities.\n\nBased on this, Superstring Theory is the one that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
