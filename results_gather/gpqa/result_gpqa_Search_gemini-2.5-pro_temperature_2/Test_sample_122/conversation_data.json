    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   Relative velocity between the frames, **v** = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), **Δt₀** = 50 s. This is the *proper time* because, for an observer on the ejecta, the clock is at rest.\n    *   The speed of light, **c** ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval. The formula for time dilation is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    where **γ** (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n        √0.96 ≈ 0.9798\n        γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n5.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    The distance (`d`) is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame (`Δt`).\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\n    For a more precise calculation without rounding intermediate steps:\n    *   d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96\n    *   d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n    *   d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option B.\n\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe closest answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
