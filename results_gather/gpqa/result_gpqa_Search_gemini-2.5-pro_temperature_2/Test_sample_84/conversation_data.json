    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody, heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   *A* is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light reflected).\n*   *a* is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we can set up a fraction of their respective temperature equations. Since both planets orbit the same star and are assumed to have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) cancel out.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K).\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is given by:\n\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nwhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   *G* is the gravitational constant.\n*   *a* is the semi-major axis.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, *a*:\n\na = G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1). The terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) will cancel out.\n\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\nThe maximum radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), so the ratio K1/K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1/Δλ2.\n\nThe given values are:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, let's find the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n(a2 / a1) = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 4. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, substitute the value of (a2 / a1) back into the equilibrium temperature ratio equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = 15 / 28\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is ~0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
