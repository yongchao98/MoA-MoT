    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume × Concentration = 0.020 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol\n*   **Total volume after dilution:**\n    20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. Titration Reaction and Equivalence Point\n\nThe titration reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is:\n\nCH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\nThe volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (the point where moles of acid equal moles of base) is:\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH (Veq):**\n    (Moles of Acid) / (Concentration of Base) = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **pKa of acetic acid:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log (\\[Conjugate Base] / \\[Acid])\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to 0.001 mol of its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate then reacts with water (hydrolysis), producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate (\\[CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ from hydrolysis:**\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻] ≈ \\[OH⁻]² / 0.02\n    \\[OH⁻] = √(Kb × 0.02) = √(5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
