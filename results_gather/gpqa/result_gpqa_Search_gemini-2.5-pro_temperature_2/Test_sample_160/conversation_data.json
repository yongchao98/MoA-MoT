    "To determine the relationship between λ1 (mean free path for gas-gas collisions) and λ2 (mean free path for electron-gas collisions), we need to analyze the formulas that define them.\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** In a gas composed of identical molecules, the mean free path (λ1) accounts for the motion of all particles. The formula is given by:\n    *   **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Where *n* is the number density of the gas molecules and *σ_gg* is the kinetic collision cross-section for gas molecule-gas molecule interactions (related to the molecule's diameter, d, as in σ_gg = πd²). The √2 factor arises because both the \"projectile\" and \"target\" molecules are in random thermal motion relative to each other.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons in a Gas (λ2):** In this case, a beam of high-energy electrons (1000 kV) travels through the gas. The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible compared to the relativistic speed of the electrons. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. The mean free path for a beam of particles hitting stationary targets is:\n    *   **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, *n* is the same number density of gas molecules, and *σ_eg* is the effective scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Comparison:** Now, we can compare λ2 and λ1 by taking their ratio:\n    *   **λ2 / λ1 = (1 / (n * σ_eg)) / (1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg))**\n    *   **λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg**\n\nThe final relationship depends on the relative sizes of the two cross-sections:\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Kinetic Cross-Section):** This relates to the physical \"billiard-ball\" size of the gas molecules.\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This describes the probability of a high-energy electron being significantly deflected by a gas molecule. An atom or molecule is mostly empty space. A high-energy point-particle like an electron can often pass through the atomic electron cloud without significant interaction. For a collision to occur, the electron must come very close to the atomic nucleus or an inner-shell electron. Consequently, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section of two molecules.\n\nSince σ_eg is much smaller than σ_gg, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio **λ2 / λ1** is not only larger than 1, but it is significantly larger than **√2 (which is approximately 1.414)**.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This range is below the theoretical minimum increase of ~1.414 that would occur even if the cross-sections were equal.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The physical situations are different.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Since our analysis shows that λ2 is significantly greater than 1.414 * λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 * λ1. This is the only conclusion that aligns with the physics of the scenario.\n\nThe electrons, being small and fast, travel a much longer average distance before interacting with a gas molecule than the gas molecules travel before interacting with each other.\n\n<<<D>>>"
