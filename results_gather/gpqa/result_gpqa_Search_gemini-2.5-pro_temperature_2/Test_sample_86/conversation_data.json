    "Here is a breakdown of the information provided to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Structure Analysis:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves 2 carbons for the substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present, meaning a halogen is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:** The most logical structure that accommodates these features is a halo-substituted acetophenone. The substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). This structure, `X-C6H4-COCH3`, has a total of 8 carbon atoms (6 from the ring and 2 from the acetyl group).\n\n**2. 1H NMR Prediction for Halo-acetophenone:**\n\n*   **Acetyl Group (-COCH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group and have no neighboring protons to couple with. Therefore, they should appear as a single peak (a singlet) integrating to 3 hydrogens. The typical chemical shift for such protons is around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** The benzene ring has two substituents, so there are 4 protons on the ring. Their appearance depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** Due to the symmetry of a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically split into two groups of two. This results in a characteristic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 hydrogens.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This is incorrect. There are no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), and the chemical shift for the 3H singlet (1.3 ppm) is too low for a methyl group next to a carbonyl.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    This is incorrect. The integration of the signals (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) does not match the 4 aromatic protons and 3 methyl protons expected for a halo-acetophenone.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This option aligns perfectly with the predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a 3-proton singlet at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl group's methyl protons.\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** These are two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This is the classic pattern for a 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring. Spectra for compounds like 4'-chloroacetophenone and 4'-bromoacetophenone confirm this pattern.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    This is incorrect. A signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. A para-substituted halobenzaldehyde would only have 7 carbon atoms, not 8.\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option C correctly describes it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
