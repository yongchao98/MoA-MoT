    "In a universe where isolated magnetic north or south poles—known as magnetic monopoles—could exist, two of the fundamental Maxwell's equations that describe electromagnetism would need to be altered.\n\nCurrently, one of Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for magnetism, is expressed as ∇ ⋅ B = 0. This formula states that the divergence of the magnetic field (B) is zero, which mathematically means there are no \"sources\" or \"sinks\" for magnetic field lines—they always form closed loops. The existence of a magnetic monopole would mean there is a point from which magnetic field lines can originate (a north pole) or terminate (a south pole). To account for this, the equation would be modified to include a term for magnetic charge density (ρm), making it analogous to Gauss's law for electricity: ∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρm. This change directly relates to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\nFurthermore, the existence of magnetic charge implies that its movement would create a magnetic current (Jm). To maintain the symmetry of the equations, this new magnetic current must act as a source for an electric field. This would require modifying Faraday's Law of Induction, which describes the curl, or circulation, of the electric field (E). The standard equation, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t, would be updated to include the magnetic current, becoming ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jm. This second modification concerns the **circulation of the electric field**.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<D>>>"
