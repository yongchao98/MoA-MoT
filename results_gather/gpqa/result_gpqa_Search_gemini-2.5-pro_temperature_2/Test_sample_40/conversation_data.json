    "This problem is a direct application of Einstein's velocity addition formula, a cornerstone of special relativity.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The laboratory frame (the observer).\n    *   The rest frame of the moving glass.\n\n2.  **Define the velocities.**\n    *   Let `u` be the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the laboratory. This is the value we need to find.\n    *   Let `v` be the velocity of the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   Let `u'` be the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass itself.\n\n3.  **Determine the speed of light in the stationary medium.**\n    *   The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`.\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, should be taken as 1.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass's own frame of reference is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n4.  **Apply Einstein's velocity addition formula.**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    *   Substituting our values (`u' = 1/n` and `c = 1`) into the formula, we get:\n        `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To simplify this complex fraction, find a common denominator for the numerator and the denominator, which is `n`.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n    *   Now, substitute these back into the equation for `u`:\n        `u = ((1 + n*v) / n) / ((n + v) / n)`\n    *   The `n` in the denominators cancels out, leaving:\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple addition of velocities, was experimentally confirmed by the Fizeau experiment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
