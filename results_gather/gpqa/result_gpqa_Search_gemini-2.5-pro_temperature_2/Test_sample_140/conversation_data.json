    "This reaction is a classic example of nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Here's a breakdown of the steps to determine the possible products:\n\n1.  **Formation of the Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates can form:\n\n    *   **Major Pathway:** The amide ion abstracts the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Minor Pathway:** The amide ion abstracts the deuteron from C2. This is slower but still possible. Elimination of the bromide ion then forms a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed, resulting in a **non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates:** The amide ion (⁻NH₂) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (Major Pathway):**\n        *   If the amide attacks C1, the resulting carbanion is at C6. Protonation by the ammonia solvent yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   If the amide attacks C6, the carbanion forms at C1. Protonation yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Attack on non-deuterated benzyne (Minor Pathway):**\n        *   The amide ion attacks the benzyne (at either C1 or C2). Subsequent protonation yields regular, non-deuterated **aniline**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
