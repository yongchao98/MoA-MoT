  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "This is a problem about genetic interaction, specifically epistasis and gene function, which can be solved by analyzing the phenotypes of single and double mutants.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Single Mutants:**\n    *   The wild-type (control) has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` knockout: 75% resistance. This means gene G1 is responsible for some part of the resistance, and its loss reduces resistance by 25%.\n    *   `g2` knockout: 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype, indicating a complete loss of resistance. This suggests G2 plays a critical, essential role in the pathway.\n    *   `g3` knockout: 50% resistance. Gene G3 is also important, responsible for about half of the total resistance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis:**\n    *   Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of a double mutant (`genex` `geney`) is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants, meaning one gene's effect masks the other's. The gene whose phenotype persists in the double mutant is called \"epistatic\" to the other gene.\n    *   **Interaction with G2:**\n        *   `g1g2` double mutant: 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` mutant (75%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n        *   `g2g3` double mutant: 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` mutant (50%). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   **Conclusion about G2:** Since the `g2` knockout phenotype (0% resistance) masks the phenotypes of `g1` and `g3`, G2 must act upstream of G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. Given the prompt states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, **G2 is the transcription factor.** It likely activates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3:**\n    *   `g1g3` double mutant: 10% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype (10%) is *not* the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%) or the `g3` phenotype (50%). Therefore, there is no simple epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 in which one masks the other.\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant is more severe than either single mutant, and even more severe than adding the individual losses (a 25% loss for `g1` + a 50% loss for `g3` = 75% total loss, leading to an expected 25% resistance. The actual result is 10%). This indicates a synergistic interaction, where G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance.\n    *   **Gene Redundancy:** This is incorrect. If the genes were redundant, knocking out one would have a mild effect because the other would compensate. Here, both single knockouts have significant effects on resistance.\n    *   **Pleiotropy:** This term describes a single gene affecting multiple traits. In this context, it's used more broadly to describe when multiple genes (G1 and G3) contribute to a single complex trait (resistance), likely by affecting different components of the resistance mechanism. This is a plausible description.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct, based on our analysis.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Plausible. They both contribute to the complex trait of resistance.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, this is the best-fitting option overall.\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. The `g1` knockout has the mildest phenotype, while the TF should have a major effect. G2 is the TF.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Incorrect. The single mutants have strong phenotypes.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.**\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: Cannot be determined from this experiment.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A contains the most accurate conclusions derived from the experimental data. The primary finding from an epistasis analysis is the identification of the upstream gene (the transcription factor G2). Option A correctly identifies this. It also provides a plausible description of the G1-G3 relationship as pleiotropic. Although the final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is inconsistent with the data, the other options contain more definitive errors. Therefore, Option A is the best choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
