    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Rest mass: M\n    *   Rest-mass energy: Mc² = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies T₁ and T₂, respectively.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n*   We have two equations for the masses:\n    1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n    2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n    *   3m₂ = 0.99M\n    *   m₂ = 0.33M\n\n*   Now find m₁:\n    *   m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\n*   We can now find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n    *   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   **Q = T₁ + T₂** = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** E_initial = E_final\n    *   Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)\n    *   300 GeV = 297 GeV + T₁ + T₂\n    *   T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest (p_initial = 0), so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   |p₁| = |p₂|\n\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²:\n    *   (p₁c)² = E₁² - (m₁c²)² = (T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)²\n    *   (p₂c)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n\n*   Since (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²:\n    *   (T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²\n\n*   Substitute T₂ = 3 - T₁ and the mass-energy values (in GeV):\n    *   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * 198 = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * 99\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (6 - 2T₁) * 99\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁\n    *   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    *   600T₁ = 603\n    *   **T₁ (relativistic)** = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = **1005 MeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\n*   In the classical limit, momentum p = mv and kinetic energy T = ½mv².\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   m₁v₁ = m₂v₂\n\n*   The kinetic energies are T₁ = p₁²/(2m₁) and T₂ = p₂²/(2m₂).\n*   Since the momenta are equal in magnitude (p₁=p₂), the ratio of kinetic energies is:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (p₁²/2m₁) / (p₂²/2m₂) = m₂ / m₁\n    *   Given m₁ = 2m₂, the ratio is m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2.\n    *   So, T₂ = 2T₁.\n\n*   Using the total kinetic energy from the Q-value:\n    *   T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n    *   T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV\n    *   3T₁ = 3 GeV\n    *   **T₁ (classical)** = 1 GeV = **1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   ΔT₁ = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   ΔT₁ = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
