    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a clear axis of symmetry like a spheroid oscillating along that axis, is most fundamentally modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The key characteristics of electric dipole radiation are its angular distribution and its dependence on the oscillation frequency (and thus wavelength).\n\n*   **Angular Distribution of Power:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (denoted dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It follows a specific pattern given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case).\n\n    *   The radiated power is zero along the axis of oscillation (θ = 0° and θ = 180°).\n    *   The power is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis (θ = 90°), where sin²(90°) = 1. This maximum power is given as *A* in the problem.\n\n    To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we calculate:\n    `Fraction = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/2)² / 1² = 1/4`\n    Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power *A*.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence of Power:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The relationship between angular frequency (ω) and wavelength (λ) is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where c is the speed of light.\n\n    Therefore, the radiated power `f` is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`. This strong dependence on wavelength is also responsible for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue. Shorter wavelengths are scattered much more effectively than longer ones.\n\nCombining these two results:\n\n*   The fraction of maximum power *A* at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
