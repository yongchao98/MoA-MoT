    "### Final Product Identified Through Spectroscopic Analysis and Reaction Chemistry\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data and the chemical reaction, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n\nThe infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were used to determine the structure of the initial reactant, Compound X.\n*   **IR Spectrum:** The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) group, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond within an aromatic ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very downfield, broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are indicative of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining signals were used to identify the second substituent group:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to adjacent protons.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A methine group (-CH) likely attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   Assembling these fragments reveals a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃].\n\nCombining these findings, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Reaction and Final Product:**\n\nCompound X is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydrogen iodide (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. When a carboxylic acid is reacted with red P and HI, the entire carboxyl group (-COOH) is fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). This is a strong reduction that converts the acid functionality directly to an alkane.\n\nApplying this to Compound X:\n*   The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring is converted to a methyl group.\n*   The *sec*-butyl group at the fourth position of the ring remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
