    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT telescope, we must evaluate each case against the given detection criterion: a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### **ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude**\n\nAccording to ESO's official documentation for ESPRESSO, the instrument can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10 in a one-hour exposure for a star with a V-band magnitude of about 17. This is for the single UT (Unit Telescope) mode.\n\n### **Star Analysis**\n\n**Observability from Paranal Observatory:**\nParanal Observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude restricts the visibility of stars in the northern celestial sky. The declination of a celestial object is a key factor in its observability. A star's declination must be greater than approximately -65 degrees (90 degrees - 25 degrees) to be observable from this latitude. More practically, for a telescope with a zenith distance limit of 70 degrees, the observable declination range is roughly between +45 and -90 degrees.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky.\n*   **Coordinates:** Canopus is located in the southern constellation of Carina, with a declination of about -52° 42'.\n*   **Detectability:** Its declination makes it easily observable from Paranal. Given its extreme brightness (much brighter than the magnitude 17 limit), Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Approximately 2.0.\n*   **Coordinates:** Polaris is the North Star, located in the constellation Ursa Minor. Its declination is very close to +90° (+89° 15' 51\").\n*   **Detectability:** Due to its extreme northern declination, Polaris is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude calculation:** Using the formula m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5, where M=15 and d=10 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15.\n*   **Coordinates:** Declination is 0 degrees, which is readily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 15 is well within ESPRESSO's limiting magnitude of ~17. This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude calculation:** With M=15 and d=200 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505.\n*   **Coordinates:** Declination is 0 degrees, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than ESPRESSO's limit of ~17 for the given S/N and exposure time. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude calculation:** With M=15 and d=5 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495.\n*   **Coordinates:** Declination is 0 degrees, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the ~17 limit. This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude calculation:** With M=15 and d=50 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495.\n*   **Coordinates:** Declination is 0 degrees, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than ESPRESSO's limit of ~17. This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe following stars are detectable by ESPRESSO under the specified conditions:\n1.  **Canopus** (a)\n2.  **Star with apparent magnitude 15** (c)\n3.  **Star with apparent magnitude 13.5** (e)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
