    "The user wants to find the correct reaction sequence to synthesize **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** from **ethynylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Analysis of the Final Product\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n*   **Structure:** This is an α-hydroxy aldehyde. The parent structure is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, where a cyclohexane ring is bonded to a -CHO group. At the α-carbon (the ring carbon bonded to the -CHO group), there is a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl substituent.\n*   **Formation:** This structure is the product of a self-aldol addition reaction of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. In this reaction, one molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. The reaction requires a base catalyst, such as Ba(OH)₂ or NaOH.\n\n### Analysis of the Overall Transformation\n\nThe core task is to transform the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which can then undergo the aldol reaction.\n\n### Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nLet's break down each option to see if it accomplishes this transformation.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n1.  Reaction with NaNH₂ and methyl chloride will alkylate the alkyne, forming 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  H₂/Pd is a strong reducing agent that would convert the alkyne directly to an alkane (cyclohexylpropane), which is unreactive for the subsequent steps. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n1.  NaNH₂ is a strong base that would be neutralized by the acidic methanol. This first step is not productive for modifying the ethynylcyclohexane structure in a useful way. This sequence is illogical from the start.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n1.  **Alkylation:** Ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated by sodium amide (NaNH₂) and then reacted with methyl chloride to form **1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne**.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The product from step 1 is treated with H₂ over Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst). This selectively reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, yielding **(Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene**.\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S). This reaction breaks the double bond to form two aldehyde products: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** and **acetaldehyde**.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** The mixture of aldehydes is treated with barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a base that catalyzes the aldol reaction. The self-condensation of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will produce the desired target molecule, **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. While other aldol products are possible, this pathway successfully generates the necessary reagents and conditions to form the specified product.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n1.  Alkylation with ethyl chloride would form 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne.\n2.  Reduction with Li/liq. NH₃ would form the *trans*-alkene, (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene.\n3.  Ozonolysis followed by an **oxidative workup** (H₂O) would cleave the double bond to form carboxylic acids (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and propanoic acid), not the required aldehyde. This makes the sequence incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Option C is the only chemically correct route to synthesize the target molecule from the given starting material.\n\n<<<C>>>"
