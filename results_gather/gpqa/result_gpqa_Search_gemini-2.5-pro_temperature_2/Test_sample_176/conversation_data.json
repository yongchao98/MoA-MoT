    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which describes the power radiated from a black body in terms of its temperature and size.\n\n### Key Formulas:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law for Luminosity (L):** The total energy radiated per unit time by a star is its luminosity. For a spherical star radiating as a black body, the luminosity is given by:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where:\n        *   `L` is the luminosity.\n        *   `R` is the radius of the star.\n        *   `T` is the surface temperature of the star in Kelvin.\n        *   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most light.\n    *   λ_max = b / T\n    *   Where `b` is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Doppler Shift:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving away from the observer, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the rest wavelength (λ_rest). This is known as redshift.\n    *   λ_obs = λ_rest * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n    *   Where `v` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Ratio of Luminosities:**\n    We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n    *   L₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\n    *   L₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\n    The ratio is:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars *appeared* brightest is the same for both. This refers to the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n    *   Therefore, λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its light is not Doppler shifted. Its observed peak wavelength is equal to its intrinsic (rest) peak wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its light is redshifted. We must relate its observed wavelength to its rest wavelength using the Doppler shift formula.\n    *   λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)]\n    *   Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have: λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   From Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T), we can substitute temperature for wavelength: b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √[(1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c)].\n    *   This simplifies to: T₁ / T₂ = √[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)].\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (√[(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)])⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c)]²\n\n    Now, we plug in the values:\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333)]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * [0.997667 / 1.002333]²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * (0.99534)²\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
