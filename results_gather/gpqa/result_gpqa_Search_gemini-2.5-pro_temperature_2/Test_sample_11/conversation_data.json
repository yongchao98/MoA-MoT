    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n\n**Given:**\n*   Decay process: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν(μ)\n*   The parent pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion. After the decay, this energy is distributed between the total energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν).\n\n*   **E_initial = E_final**\n*   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n\n*   m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest masses.\n\n*   **Total KE = KE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π - m_μ) * c²**\n*   Total KE = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = **33.9 MeV**\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon and the neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta.\n\n*   **p_μ = p_ν = p**\n\n### 3. Calculating the Momentum\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation (E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²) to find the momentum. From the conservation of energy:\n\n*   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n*   m_π * c² = √( (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + p_νc   *(Since the neutrino is massless, E_ν = p_νc)*\n*   m_π * c² - p c = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nNow, we square both sides and solve for *pc*:\n\n*   (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²) (pc)\n*   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n*   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n*   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n*   **pc ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\n### 4. Calculating the Kinetic Energies\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    For a massless particle, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, which is also equal to its momentum times the speed of light.\n    *   KE_ν = p_νc = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is the total energy released minus the kinetic energy carried away by the neutrino.\n    *   KE_μ = Total KE - KE_ν\n    *   KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = **4.1 MeV**\n    *   Alternatively, it can be calculated from its total energy minus its rest energy. The muon's total energy is E_μ = m_πc² - KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV. So, KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = **4.1 MeV**.\n\nMore precise calculations using these principles yield a kinetic energy for the muon of approximately 4.12 MeV.\n\nThus, the kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of μ⁺: **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of ν: **29.8 MeV**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
