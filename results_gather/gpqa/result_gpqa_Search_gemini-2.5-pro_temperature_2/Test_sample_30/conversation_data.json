    "The multi-step reaction sequence is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration). The methyl group of toluene is an ortho, para-director. The major product, formed due to less steric hindrance, is *p*-nitrotoluene. Thus, Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene**.\n2.  **Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄:** This is an oxidation reaction. While MnO₂ with sulfuric acid can be a very strong oxidizing agent, a key reaction it performs is the oxidation of a benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. Although further oxidation to a carboxylic acid is possible, the subsequent reaction step strongly suggests the formation of an aldehyde. A patent describes the oxidation of *p*-nitrotoluene to *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde as a known process step. Therefore, Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n3.  **Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide:** This reaction is a crossed-aldol condensation known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, which has no α-hydrogens, acts as the electrophile. Acetone, in the presence of sodium hydroxide, forms an enolate which acts as the nucleophile. The initial adduct rapidly dehydrates to form a stable α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, where the E-isomer (trans) is the more stable and major product.\n\nThe final product, Product 3, is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must analyze the symmetry elements of this molecule. The structure is:\n\n`O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\nThe molecule possesses a planar backbone due to the sp² hybridization of the benzene ring carbons, the carbons of the double bond, and the carbonyl group. This planarity allows for maximum electronic conjugation.\n\nThe symmetry elements are:\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n*   **Rotation axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂ or higher-order rotation axes. The two ends of the molecule are different (a nitrophenyl group versus an acetyl group), which precludes a C₂ axis along the main molecular axis.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Because the main framework of the molecule is planar, this molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. All the heavy atoms (C, O, N) lie within this plane.\n\nSince the only symmetry element besides the identity is a single plane of symmetry, the molecule belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
