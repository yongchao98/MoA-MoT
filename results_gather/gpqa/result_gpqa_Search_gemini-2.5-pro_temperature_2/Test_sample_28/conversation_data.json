    "To determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein will be unable to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nLet's first translate the beginning of the intact gene into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   The initial amino acid sequence is: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-...**\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant in the same way:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   There is a typo in the provided mutant 1 sequence in the prompt: `ATGTTCTACGCT...`. It should likely read `ATG TTT TAC GCT` for a single point mutation from the original or is a combination of two mutations. However, reading the codons as they are (`ATG TTC TAC`), the changes from the original `ATG TTT CTC` are:\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC` (Both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC` (Codes for Tyrosine).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid Leucine to Tyrosine. This might alter or destroy protein function, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   Here, the original `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely.\n    *   The resulting protein would only be two amino acids long (Met-Phe). Such a drastically shortened protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n    *   The original `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC` (Codes for Tyrosine).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine. Like Mutant 1, this may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5'-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n    * The beginning of this mutant sequence is identical to Mutant 3, indicating a **missense mutation** that changes Leucine to Tyrosine. It also has downstream differences from Mutant 3, but the initial, most critical mutation type is the same.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA missense mutation (like in Mutants 1, 3, and 4) changes a single amino acid. This might be enough to inactivate the protein if the amino acid is in a critical location, but often it only reduces function or has no effect.\n\nA nonsense mutation (like in Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon. Because this mutation occurs very early in the gene (at the third codon), it will result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to completely eliminate the protein's activity.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
