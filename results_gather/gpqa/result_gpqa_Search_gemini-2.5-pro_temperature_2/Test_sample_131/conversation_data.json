    "To determine the two compounds in the mixture, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential molecules and see which pair fits the description. All four molecules share the same molecular formula, C10H14.\n\n**The experimental data from the 1:1 mixture shows:**\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single singlet (12H) in the alkyl region. The two aromatic protons are also equivalent, giving one singlet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n    *   *Summary:* One aromatic singlet, one alkyl singlet.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons to couple with. This results in two singlets (1H each), a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the two equivalent methyls at C1 and C3 (6H), the methyl at C2 (3H), and the methyl at C5 (3H). This results in three singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   *Summary:* Two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio), three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing a signal that is a multiplet (specifically, an AA' system), not two distinct singlets. This immediately disqualifies this compound.\n    *   *Summary:* One aromatic multiplet, two alkyl singlets.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling. The methylene (-CH2-) protons will appear as a quartet, and the methyl (-CH3-) protons will appear as a triplet. These are not singlets. This immediately disqualifies this compound.\n    *   *Summary:* One aromatic singlet, one alkyl quartet, and one alkyl triplet.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination is the most direct way to solve this problem:\n*   Options C and D are incorrect because they include 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, whose aromatic protons would not appear as two singlets.\n*   Option B is incorrect because it includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, whose alkyl protons would appear as a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n\nThis leaves only Option A. The provided spectral data (two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is actually a perfect description of the spectrum for pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone. The question states that this is the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture. While this introduces some confusion about potential signal overlap, the features described (specifically, the lack of proton coupling) definitively exclude all other options. The only possible components that produce *only* singlets in both regions are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds must be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
