    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalize the state |α⟩\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. Let's call the unnormalized state |ψ⟩:\n|ψ⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩\n\nTo normalize it, we must ensure that the inner product ⟨α|α⟩ = 1. The normalized state |α⟩ will be |α⟩ = N|ψ⟩, where N is a normalization constant.\n\nThe inner product is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [(1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|] ⋅ [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nFor the state |α⟩ to be normalized, we require N²⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1.\nN² * 7 = 1  =>  N = 1/√7\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\n\nIn vector notation, where |up⟩ =ᵀ and |down⟩ =ᵀ, the state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n### 2. Define the Operator Matrix A\n\nThe problem states that the elements of the operator A are Aᵢⱼ = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. For a 2x2 system (spin up/down), the matrix is:\nA = [A₁₁, A₁₂; A₂₁, A₂₂] = [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0] = (ħ/2) * [0, 1; 1, 0]\n\nThis operator is ħ/2 times the Pauli-X matrix (σₓ).\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation A|v⟩ = λ|v⟩.\ndet(A - λI) = 0\ndet([-λ, ħ/2; ħ/2, -λ]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenstates:\n\n**For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n(A - λ₁I)|v₁⟩ = 0\n[(ħ/2) * [0, 1; 1, 0] - (ħ/2) * [1, 0; 0, 1]] * [a; b] = 0\n(ħ/2) * [-1, 1; 1, -1] * [a; b] = 0\nThis gives the equation -a + b = 0, so a = b.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector isᵀ.\nNormalizing it gives the eigenstate |v₁⟩ = (1/√2) *ᵀ = (1/√2)(|up⟩ + |down⟩).\n\n**For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n(A - λ₂I)|v₂⟩ = 0\n[(ħ/2) * [0, 1; 1, 0] + (ħ/2) * [1, 0; 0, 1]] * [a; b] = 0\n(ħ/2) * [1, 1; 1, 1] * [a; b] = 0\nThis gives the equation a + b = 0, so a = -b.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]ᵀ.\nNormalizing it gives the eigenstate |v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2)(|up⟩ - |down⟩).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate |vᵢ⟩ is given by Pᵢ = |⟨vᵢ|α⟩|².\n\n**Probability for eigenstate |v₁⟩ (with eigenvalue λ₁ = +ħ/2):**\nP₁ = |⟨v₁|α⟩|²\n⟨v₁|α⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨up| + ⟨down|)] ⋅ [(1/√7)((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]\n⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]\n⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\nP₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428\n\n**Probability for eigenstate |v₂⟩ (with eigenvalue λ₂ = -ħ/2):**\nP₂ = |⟨v₂|α⟩|²\n⟨v₂|α⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨up| - ⟨down|)] ⋅ [(1/√7)((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]\n⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]\n⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\nP₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average or expectation value ⟨A⟩ can be calculated in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues**\n⟨A⟩ = Σᵢ Pᵢλᵢ = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\n**Method 2: Using the formula ⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩**\nA|α⟩ = (ħ/2)[0, 1; 1, 0] * (1/√7)[(1+i); (2-i)] = (ħ/(2√7)) * [(2-i); (1+i)]\n⟨A⟩ = ⟨α| (A|α⟩)\n⟨A⟩ = [(1/√7) * (1-i, 2+i)] ⋅ [(ħ/(2√7)) * (2-i; 1+i)]\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]\n⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are P₁ ≈ 0.64 and P₂ ≈ 0.36, and the average value is ⟨A⟩ = ħ/7. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
