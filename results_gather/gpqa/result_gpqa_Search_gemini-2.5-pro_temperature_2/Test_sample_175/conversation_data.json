    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define and Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system |ψ⟩ is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `( -1 )`\n      `(  2 )`\n      `(  1 )`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm of the state is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalized state vector, |ψ_norm⟩, is therefore:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `( -1 )`\n                       `(  2 )`\n                       `(  1 )`\n\n**2. Measurement of Observable P**\n\nThe operator for observable P is:\nP = `( 0, 1/√2,   0 )`\n    `( 1/√2,   0, 1/√2 )`\n    `( 0, 1/√2,   0 )`\n\nWe need to find the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, this requires finding the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues of P:**\n    The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.\n    `| -λ,  1/√2,   0  |`\n    `| 1/√2,  -λ,  1/√2 |` = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0\n    `|  0,  1/√2,  -λ  |`\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, and -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0.\n    `( 0, 1/√2,   0 ) (v1)`   `(0)`\n    `( 1/√2, 0,  1/√2 ) (v2)` = `(0)`\n    `( 0, 1/√2,   0 ) (v3)`   `(0)`\n\n    From the first and third row equations, (1/√2)v₂ = 0, which implies v₂ = 0.\n    From the second row equation, (1/√2)v₁ + (1/√2)v₃ = 0, which implies v₁ = -v₃.\n    The eigenvector is of the form `(c, 0, -c)`. We can choose c = 1 to get `(1, 0, -1)`.\n    Normalizing this eigenvector gives us the state |p₀⟩:\n    ||(1, 0, -1)|| = √(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2\n    |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `( 1 )`\n                         `( 0 )`\n                         `(-1 )`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    The probability, Prob(P=0), is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state |ψ_norm⟩ onto the eigenvector |p₀⟩.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n    ⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * `(1, 0, -1)`] * [(1/√6) * `(-1, 2, 1)`ᵀ]\n    = (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n    Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3.\n\n**3. State Collapse after Measuring P**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector, |p₀⟩. So, the new state |ψ'⟩ is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `( 1 )`\n                         `( 0 )`\n                         `(-1 )`\n\n**4. Measurement of Observable Q**\n\nThe operator for observable Q is:\nQ = `( 1, 0,  0 )`\n    `( 0, 0,  0 )`\n    `( 0, 0, -1 )`\n\nNow we measure Q on the new state |ψ'⟩. We want to find the probability of getting the value -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = -1:**\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is |q₋₁⟩:\n    |q₋₁⟩ = `( 0 )`\n           `( 0 )`\n           `( 1 )`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:**\n    The probability, Prob(Q=-1 after P=0), is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the new state |ψ'⟩ onto the eigenvector |q₋₁⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n    ⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [`(0, 0, 1)`] * [(1/√2) * `(1, 0, -1)`ᵀ]\n    = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2\n    Prob(Q=-1) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2.\n\n**5. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in sequence:\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) × Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
