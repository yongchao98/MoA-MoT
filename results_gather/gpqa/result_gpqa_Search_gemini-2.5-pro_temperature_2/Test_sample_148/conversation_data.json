    "Based on the provided analytical data, the most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this option is the best fit:\n*   **1H NMR Data**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals that sum to the expected 1H. This indicates the presence of two different, but very similar, chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Diastereomers are different compounds with different physical properties and would be expected to have slightly different NMR spectra. Enantiomers, on the other hand, are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. The problem also rules out spin-spin coupling.\n*   **LC-MS Data**: The analysis shows two separate peaks of equal intensity, which both exhibit the same mass spectrum consistent with the target molecule. This is classic evidence for a mixture of isomers (compounds with the same chemical formula and thus the same mass). Since the two species are separable by standard liquid chromatography, they must be diastereomers, as enantiomers would co-elute on a standard (achiral) column.\n\n**How could a mixture of diastereomers form in peptide synthesis?**\n\nThere are two common ways this can occur:\n\n1.  **Epimerization**: During the chemical synthesis, particularly during amide bond formation, the chiral center of an amino acid can sometimes lose its stereochemical integrity through a process called epimerization. This means that if you started with an all L-amino acid peptide, one of the residues could have partially converted to its D-form, resulting in a mixture of two diastereomers (e.g., L-L-L and L-D-L). These epimerized products often have very similar physical characteristics, making purification difficult.\n2.  ***Cis-Trans* Isomerism**: Peptide bonds have partial double-bond character, which restricts rotation. While most peptide bonds strongly favor the *trans* conformation, the peptide bond preceding a proline residue has a relatively low energy barrier to rotation, allowing for significant populations of both *cis* and *trans* isomers. These *cis* and *trans* rotamers are a form of diastereomerism and exist as distinct, interconverting species that give separate peaks in NMR and can often be separated by LC. Protons on amino acids adjacent to the proline residue are particularly affected and will show two sets of signals.\n\n**Evaluating the other options:**\n\n*   **A) Contamination with a precursor**: This is unlikely because the LC-MS shows both peaks have the same mass spectrum as the expected product. A precursor would almost certainly have a different mass.\n*   **B) Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are not distinguishable by standard NMR or LC and would produce only a single set of peaks and a single LC peak.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling'**: This term usually refers to a synthetic procedure to improve yield, not a specific side product that would result in isomers. It does not explain the observed data.\n\nTherefore, the presence of two distinct species with identical mass, separable by LC, and showing duplicated peaks in the NMR is definitively explained by the compound being a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
