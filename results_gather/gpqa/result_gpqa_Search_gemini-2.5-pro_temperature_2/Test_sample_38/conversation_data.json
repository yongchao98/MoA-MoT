    "The search results confirm my initial approach.\n\n*   **Normalization:** The integral of the squared modulus of the wave function over all possible space must equal 1. This is known as the Born rule or the normalization condition. The probability of finding the particle is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function.\n*   **Integral of 1/(1+x):** The search results confirm that the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. Since the integration range `[1, 3]` is positive, the absolute value is not strictly necessary for the definite integral calculation.\n*   **Integral Calculators:** Several online integral calculators are available if I needed to double-check my work.\n\nMy step-by-step calculation seems solid.\n\n1.  `|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n2.  `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n3.  `[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] from 1 to 3 = 1`\n4.  `(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1`\n5.  `a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1`\n6.  `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n7.  `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n8.  `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n9.  `a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931)`\n10. `a ≈ sqrt(0.7214)`\n11. `a ≈ 0.849`\n\nThis result strongly suggests that 0.85 is the correct answer among the choices. The slight difference is likely due to rounding of `ln(2)`.\n\nThe final check of the logic:\n*   The wave function is complex.\n*   The probability density is the square of the modulus, which is `(Re)² + (Im)²`.\n*   The integral of the probability density over the given range must be 1.\n*   The integration and algebraic manipulation are correct.\n\nThe process is sound. I am confident in the result.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n`a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n`a = Sqrt(0.5 / 0.69314718056)`\n`a = Sqrt(0.72134752044)`\n`a = 0.8493218...`\n\nThis value rounds to 0.85.The problem asks to find the value of the constant \"a\" by normalizing the given wave function over the specified interval.\n\n**1. Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\nThe wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a position x is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². For a complex function of the form f(x) = u(x) + i*v(x), the square of the magnitude is |f(x)|² = u(x)² + v(x)².\n\nIn this case:\n*   The real part is u(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is v(x) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density function is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nThe normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in the region where it exists must be 1. The problem specifies that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 must equal 1:\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFirst integral:\na² * ∫ [from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n= a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nSecond integral:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25 * x] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n= 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results back into the normalization equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, take the square root to find \"a\":\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
