    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the approximate flux ratio:\n\n1.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band:** First, we must identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands under normal conditions.\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV):** The primary contributors to this band are neutrinos from the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B), which are produced in the pp-III branch, and neutrinos from the CNO cycle. Both have continuous energy spectra that pass through this range.\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV):** This band is overwhelmingly dominated by a single, sharp, mono-energetic neutrino line at **861 keV** from the decay of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). This reaction is part of the pp-II branch. Like Band 1, this band also receives a much smaller, continuous flux from ⁸B and CNO neutrinos.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Change:** The problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n    *   The pp-III branch is the sole producer of ⁸B in the Sun. Therefore, stopping this branch means the flux of **⁸B neutrinos goes to zero** across all energies.\n    *   The prompt specifies that \"all other reactions remained as they were.\" This is crucial because it means the fluxes from the pp-I, pp-II (including the ⁷Be neutrinos), and CNO cycle reactions are entirely unaffected.\n\n3.  **Calculate the New Fluxes in Each Band:** Now, let's determine what neutrino sources are left contributing to each band *after* the pp-III branch has stopped.\n    *   **New Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The ⁸B neutrino component has vanished. The only remaining source of flux in this band is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle neutrinos.\n    *   **New Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The small continuous flux from ⁸B is gone. What remains is the very large, mono-energetic flux from ⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV, plus the small continuous flux from CNO neutrinos.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes and Find the Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the new fluxes: Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n    *   **Flux (Band 1):** Consists only of the CNO neutrino flux integrated over a 100 keV window.\n    *   **Flux (Band 2):** Consists of the entire, massive flux of the ⁷Be neutrino line plus a small contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\n    The CNO cycle is a very minor contributor to the Sun's total energy output, accounting for only about 1% compared to the pp-chain's 99%. The neutrino flux from the pp-II branch (which produces the ⁷Be neutrinos) is significantly larger than the flux from the CNO cycle. In fact, looking at solar neutrino flux diagrams, the total line flux from ⁷Be is roughly two orders of magnitude (or about 100 times) greater than the continuous CNO flux in the relevant energy region.\n\n    Therefore, the flux in Band 1 (a small slice of the weak CNO flux) is now tiny compared to the flux in Band 2 (dominated by the very strong ⁷Be line). A ratio of a very small number to a much larger number results in a very small ratio. Of the choices provided, **0.01 (10⁻²)** is the value that best represents this disparity of approximately two orders of magnitude.\n\nFinal Ratio:\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux (CNO) / Flux (⁷Be) ≈ 1 / 100 = 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
