    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the reaction and the structures of the starting material and the final product.\n\n### 1. The Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's deduce its structure and molecular formula:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is the principal functional group, attached to carbon 1 of the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is attached to carbon 5.\n\nBased on this, the carbon skeleton consists of a 6-carbon ring, a 1-carbon carboxylic acid group, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group, for a total of **10 carbon atoms (C₁₀)**.\n\nA careful count of the hydrogen atoms on this structure (2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid) reveals its molecular formula to be **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nLet's verify the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material:\n*   IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n*   IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 0 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to one ring, one C=C double bond in the ring, one C=C double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O double bond in the formyl group, and one C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group (1+1+1+1+1=5).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of many oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds. Specifically:\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkene double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C), effectively hydrogenating them.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will reduce all functional groups and double bonds in the starting material to produce a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains unchanged, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀). Since all double bonds are eliminated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a saturated, substituted cycloalkane. A saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\nFor our product with 10 carbon atoms, the molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated for the product, C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n*   C = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n*   H = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\n**IHD = 1**\n\nThis IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure (cyclohexane ring) present in the final saturated product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
