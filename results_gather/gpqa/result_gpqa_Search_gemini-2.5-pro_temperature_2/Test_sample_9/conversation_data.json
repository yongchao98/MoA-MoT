    "Let's analyze the density of each exoplanet to determine which is the highest.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet essentially identical to Earth in terms of bulk properties. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm続).\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm続, which is very similar to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For a planet with an identical composition to Earth, a significant increase in mass will lead to greater gravitational compression of its materials. This increased pressure in the planet's interior will cause the material to become more compact, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be greater than Earth's 5.51 g/cm続.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with the same composition but less mass will experience weaker gravitational forces. This leads to less compression of its interior, resulting in an overall density that is lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth (c) will undergo the most significant gravitational compression, leading to the highest density among the choices. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities roughly equal to Earth's, while the planet in option (d) would be less dense.\n\n<<<A>>>"
