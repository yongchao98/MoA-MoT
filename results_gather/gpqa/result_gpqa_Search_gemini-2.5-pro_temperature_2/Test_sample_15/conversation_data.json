    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The presence of a single stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) guarantees chirality, while molecules with multiple stereocenters can be chiral or achiral (in the case of meso compounds).\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(*Z*)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule lacks a chiral center. The molecule is planar with respect to the carbon-carbon double bond, and this planarity results in a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n*   **(3a*R*,7a*S*,*E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with defined (*R* and *S*) configurations at its chiral centers. Naming a specific enantiomer like this indicates that the molecule is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n*   **(*2R,3S*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two stereocenters at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (*2R,3S*) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that makes them achiral despite the presence of stereocenters. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n*   **(*2R,3R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (*2R,3R*) configuration and its mirror image, (*2S,3S*), are non-superimposable. This pair constitutes enantiomers, both of which are chiral and **optically active**.\n*   **(*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH=CH-` section of the ring, and a `-CH2-CH2-` section of the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center. The name specifies the (*R*) enantiomer, which is a single, chiral molecule and is therefore **optically active**.\n*   **(*1s,3s,5s*)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This notation describes the *cis,cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A plane can pass through one hydroxyl-bearing carbon and the opposite carbon of the ring, reflecting the other two identical substituents. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is `cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This molecule has no chiral centers. There is a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects the rest of the molecule, rendering it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of three optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
