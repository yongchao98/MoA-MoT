    "The performed search confirms that the method used is correct. The fraction of a specific metal complex (αi) in a solution can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of the complex [MLn] is:\nαn = (βn * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βi * [L]ⁱ)) for i = 1 to N\n\nIn this problem:\nM = Co(II)\nL = SCN⁻\n[L] = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\nWe need to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂], so we are calculating α₂.\n\nThe relevant species and their formation expressions are:\n- Co²⁺: 1\n- [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]\n- [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]²\n- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³\n- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe given constants are:\nβ₁ = 9\nβ₂ = 40\nβ₃ = 63\nβ₄ = 16\n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n1.  Calculate each term in the distribution polynomial (the denominator):\n    *   1 (for free Co²⁺)\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n2.  Sum these terms to get the denominator (Σ):\n    *   Σ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n3.  The numerator is the term corresponding to the desired complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\n    *   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n4.  Calculate the fraction (α₂):\n    *   α₂ = Numerator / Σ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n5.  Convert the fraction to a percentage:\n    *   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculation is confirmed to be correct. The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
