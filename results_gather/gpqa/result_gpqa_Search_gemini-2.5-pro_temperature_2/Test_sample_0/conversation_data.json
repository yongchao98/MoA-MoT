    "To determine if two energy levels, E1 and E2, can be clearly distinguished, we must consider the consequence of their finite lifetimes. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" in its energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical calculations, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy.\n\nThe two quantum states have lifetimes of τ1 = 10⁻⁹ seconds and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ seconds. To calculate the corresponding energy widths, we can use the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electronvolt-seconds (eV·s), which is approximately ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**Energy width of State 1:**\nΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\nΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Energy width of State 2:**\nΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\nΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\nΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than the energy width of each state. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). This broader width is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels. Therefore, the energy difference between the states must be greater than this value.\n\nNow let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the energy width of either state.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is also much smaller than the energy widths.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is comparable to the width of the second state but smaller than the width of the first state. The energy distributions would overlap significantly.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is several orders of magnitude larger than the larger of the two energy widths (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nAn energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would ensure that the two energy levels are well separated and, therefore, clearly distinguishable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
