    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, of two electrons in a specific coupled state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Identify the initial state**: The two-electron system is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, where `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and `m` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum's z-component. The individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` (since they are in p orbitals).\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement outcome**: We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_1z` as -ħ and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` as -ħ.\n    *   The eigenvalue of `L_z` is given by `m_l * ħ`.\n    *   For `L_1z`, an eigenvalue of -ħ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m_1 = -1`.\n    *   For `L_2z`, an eigenvalue of -ħ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number `m_2 = -1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of angular momentum**: In the coupling of angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This means the total magnetic quantum number `m` must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`.\n    *   `m = m_1 + m_2`\n\n4.  **Check for consistency**:\n    *   From the given initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   If we sum the desired individual magnetic quantum numbers, we get `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The sum of the z-components of the desired outcome (`-2`) does not match the z-component of the initial state (`-1`). Due to the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is impossible to measure `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` simultaneously when the system is in a state with `m = -1`. Therefore, the probability of this specific measurement outcome is zero. This principle is fundamentally captured by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which would be zero for this combination.\n\nThe probability is determined by the overlap between the initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` and the final uncoupled state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>`. Because `m ≠ m_1 + m_2`, this overlap is zero, and so is the probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
