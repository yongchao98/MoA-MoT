    "The correct option is C because the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is not to prevent the breakdown of dsRNA, but rather to perform proofreading by degrading RNA in a 3'-to-5' direction to remove mismatched nucleotides.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the options:\n\n*   **A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.** This statement accurately reflects findings in virology research regarding the mechanics of ribosomal frameshifting.\n\n*   **B) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.** This correctly describes the -1 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism that occurs at the ORF1a/ORF1b junction at the 5' end of the viral genome to produce the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.\n\n*   **C) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.** This statement is incorrect. While the nsp10/nsp14 complex does operate as a heterodimer for mismatch repair (proofreading), its exonuclease (ExoN) activity involves *degrading* or *breaking down* RNA strands to remove errors. [1, 2, 4, 8] It preferentially degrades dsRNA and excises mismatched nucleotides from the 3' end. [4, 14] The claim that it *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA contradicts its fundamental function as a nuclease. [13]\n\n*   **D) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.** This is a correct description of one of the proposed mechanisms by which the ORF3a protein induces apoptosis in host cells.\n\n<<<C>>>"
