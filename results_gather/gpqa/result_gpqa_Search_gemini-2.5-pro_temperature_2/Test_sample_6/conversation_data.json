    "Here's the step-by-step derivation to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The question describes the pair production process where a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) collides with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to create an electron ($e^−$) and a positron ($e^+$): $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the threshold condition:** For this reaction to be possible, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products, which are an electron and a positron. The rest mass of an electron is identical to that of a positron, denoted as $m_e$. Therefore, the minimum energy in the CM frame, $\\sqrt{s}$, must be $2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** We need to relate the CM energy to the energies in the laboratory frame (the frame of the universe). Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_1 = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p_1})$ and $p_2 = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p_2})$ respectively. The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is invariant in all reference frames.\n\n    $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2p_1 \\cdot p_2$\n\n    Since photons have zero rest mass, $p_1^2 = p_2^2 = 0$. Thus, $s = 2p_1 \\cdot p_2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the dot product:** The dot product of the four-momenta is:\n\n    $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p_1} \\cdot \\vec{p_2}$\n\n    Since for a photon $|p| = E/c$, the dot product becomes:\n\n    $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{c} \\frac{E_{CMB}}{c} \\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$\n\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two incoming photons.\n\n5.  **Find the minimum energy threshold:** The threshold energy for the gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma}$, will be at its minimum when the interaction is most efficient. This occurs during a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180°), and $\\cos\\theta = -1$. This maximizes the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ to a value of 2.\n\n    So, for a head-on collision:\n    $s = 2 \\cdot E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}$\n\n6.  **Equate and solve for $E_{\\gamma}$:** Now we combine the threshold condition from step 2 with the result from step 5:\n\n    $s = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n7.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is approximately 0.511 MeV ($0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV).\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB}$, is given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n8.  **Convert to the required units:** The options are in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). Since $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to the value in option B. The energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes become limited is precisely this threshold, as above this energy, pair-production becomes a dominant attenuation mechanism, drastically reducing the distance these photons can travel through the universe.\n\n<<<B>>>"
