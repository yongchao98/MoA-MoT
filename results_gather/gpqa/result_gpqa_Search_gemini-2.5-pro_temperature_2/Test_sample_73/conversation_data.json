    "The problem of radioactive decay is best understood using the concept of exponential decay and its inherent memoryless property. This property dictates that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its probability of decaying in the future.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between decay probability and the decay constant (λ):**\n    The probability P(t) that an atom will decay within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n    Where 'e' is the base of the natural logarithm and 'λ' is the decay constant specific to the atom. The decay constant represents the probability that a single nucleus will decay per unit of time.\n\n2.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ) from the given data:**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    *   0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n    To find λ, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    *   -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    *   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    Due to the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in any 150-minute interval.\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n4.  **Substitute the expression for λ and solve:**\n    We can substitute the term `e^(-100λ) = 0.68` into the new calculation.\n    *   e^(-150λ) can be rewritten as (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) or (e^(-100λ))^1.5.\n    *   So, e^(-150λ) = 0.68^1.5\n\n    Now calculate the value:\n    *   0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\n    This probability of 0.4393, or 43.93%, is approximately 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is about 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
