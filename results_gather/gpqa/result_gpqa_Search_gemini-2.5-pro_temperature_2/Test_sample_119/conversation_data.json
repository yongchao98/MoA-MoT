    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** The parallax of a star, denoted as 'plx', is inversely proportional to its distance 'd'. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution and Volume:** If we assume that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space, the number of stars (N) within a given volume (V) is directly proportional to that volume. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and a small thickness 'dd'. The volume of this shell (dV) is given by:\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    Therefore, the number of stars (dN) within this shell is proportional to its volume:\n    `dN ∝ 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find how the number of stars changes with parallax. To do this, we need to express 'd' and 'dd' in the equation above in terms of 'plx' and 'd(plx)'.\n\n    *   From the distance-parallax relationship, we have `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n        For a small range of parallaxes, we can approximate this as `dd ≈ |-1 / plx²| d(plx) = (1 / plx²) d(plx)`. We take the absolute value as the number of stars cannot be negative.\n\n4.  **Combining the Expressions:** Now we can substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'dd' into our proportionality for dN:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)² * (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN / d(plx)`. Based on the relationship derived in the previous step, we can see that:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
