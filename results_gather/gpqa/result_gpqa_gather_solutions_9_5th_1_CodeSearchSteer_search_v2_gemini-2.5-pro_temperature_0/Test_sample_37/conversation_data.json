I will first establish the correct chemical pathway based on this consensus.\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:** I will list the critical concepts that determine the correct answer, such as the order of reagent addition and the regioselectivity of the reaction.\n3.  **Evaluate the Specific Options:** I will apply the correct chemical reasoning to the multiple-choice options as they are listed in the user's prompt to find the single option that is entirely correct.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. The Correct Chemical Pathway**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction starts with an iminium salt of pentan-2-one and involves a strong base (LDA), an alkylating agent (CH₃CH₂I), and an acid workup (H₃O⁺). This is a classic α-alkylation of a ketone, a variant of the Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   **Reagent Sequence (A):** The reaction must proceed in a specific order to be successful.\n    *   **Step (i): Deprotonation.** A strong base (LDA) in a solvent (DME) is used to remove a proton from the α-carbon, creating a nucleophile.\n    *   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophile attacks the electrophile (CH₃CH₂I).\n    *   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** An acid (H₃O⁺) is added to hydrolyze the intermediate back to a ketone.\n*   **Product (B):** The starting ketone is pentan-2-one. Alkylation with an ethyl group at the less-hindered α-carbon (the C1 methyl group) followed by hydrolysis yields the final product.\n    *   `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃` + ethyl group at C1 → `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n    *   The IUPAC name for this product is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**2. Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Reagent Sequence is Critical.** The strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be mixed in the same step, as they would neutralize each other. The reaction must be performed sequentially. Any option that groups these reagents in a single step is chemically incorrect.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity and Kinetic Control.** The base, LDA, is sterically bulky. It preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon (the C1 methyl group) rather than the more hindered C3 methylene group. This is known as kinetic control and dictates that the product will be heptan-4-one.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Options from the Prompt**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer must have **both** the correct sequence for A and the correct product for B.\n\n*   **Correct A:** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`\n*   **Correct B:** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the user's prompt:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence (A): **Correct.** The reagents are added sequentially and correctly.\n    *   Product (B): **Incorrect.** This product implies hydrolysis occurred without the key alkylation step.\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence (A): **Incorrect.** It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n    *   Product (B): **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence (A): **Incorrect.** The reagents in step (ii) are improperly grouped.\n    *   Product (B): **Correct.**\n\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence (A): **Correct.**\n    *   Product (B): **Correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option D correctly identifies both the required sequential addition of reagents and the final product resulting from the kinetically controlled alkylation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental principles of organic chemistry, the correct answer is determined through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reagents provided (`LDA`, `CH3CH2I`, `H3O+`) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone** via a Stork enamine synthesis. The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nThis is a multi-step synthesis where the order of reagent addition is crucial for the reaction to succeed.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Mandatory.** The reaction proceeds in three distinct stages that must be performed in order.\n    1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** A strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used in a solvent like **DME** to deprotonate the α-carbon, creating a nucleophile (an enamine). This must be the first step.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The newly formed nucleophile attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I** (ethyl iodide). This must be the second step.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Incompatible Reagents.** A strong base (LDA) and a strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would immediately neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, any option that groups these reagents in the same step is chemically incorrect.\n\nThe only chemically sound sequence for (A) is: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the Final Product (B)**\n\nThe identity of the final product is determined by which α-carbon is alkylated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity and Kinetic Control.** The starting ketone, pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), has two different α-carbons where a proton can be removed: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. The base used, **LDA**, is famously large and sterically hindered. Due to its bulk, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Product Structure and Naming.** Alkylation with an ethyl group occurs at the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). The final structure after hydrolysis is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. The correct IUPAC name for this symmetrical 7-carbon ketone is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe correct answer must have **both** the correct reagent sequence (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\n*   **Correct A:** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`\n*   **Correct B:** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect.** It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect.**\n    *   Product: **Incorrect.**\n*   **C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: **Correct.**\n    *   Product: **Incorrect.** This product implies hydrolysis occurred without the key alkylation step.\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Correct.** It shows the proper sequential addition of reagents.\n    *   Product: **Correct.** It correctly identifies the product as heptan-4-one.\n\nBased on this analysis, option D is the only choice that is entirely correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a first-principles analysis of the chemical reaction, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1.

This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**.\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reagents listed (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone** via a Stork enamine synthesis. The goal is to add an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nThis is a multi-step synthesis where the order of reagent addition is critical.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Mandatory.** The reaction requires three distinct chemical transformations that must occur in a specific order.\n    1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** A strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used in a solvent like **DME** to remove an α-proton and create a nucleophile (an enamine).

Any option that groups the strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) in the same step is incorrect, as they would simply neutralize each other.\n\n**3. Determine the Final Product (B)**\nThe structure of the final product depends on which α-carbon is alkylated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity and the Bulky Base.** The starting ketone, pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), has two different α-carbons where a proton can be removed: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Kinetic Control.** The base used, **LDA**, is famously large and sterically hindered.

This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**. The reagents listed in the options (`LDA`, `CH3CH2I`, `H3O+`) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone**, a key transformation in organic synthesis. The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nA multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition to be successful and avoid unwanted side reactions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The order of operations is critical.** The reaction must be performed in a specific sequence.\n    1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. The strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used to deprotonate the iminium salt at an α-carbon, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This step is performed in a suitable solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**. This must be the first step.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The nucleophile formed in the first step then attacks the electrophile. Here, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)** is the alkylating agent. This must be the second step.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** The final step is an acidic aqueous workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**, to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone. This must be the last step.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Avoid Incompatible Reagents.** The strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present at the same time, as they would neutralize each other, preventing the desired reaction. Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect.\n\nBased on this, the only chemically sound sequence for (A) is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity of Deprotonation.** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Kinetic Control with a Bulky Base.** The base used, **LDA**, is sterically bulky. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** α-carbon. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is significantly less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** The enamine formed attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the resulting ketone has the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The product has a 7-carbon chain (heptane) with the carbonyl group at position 4. The correct IUPAC name of the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Final Decision**\n\nWe must find the option that has **both** the correct reagent sequence (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\n*   **Correct Sequence (A):** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`\n*   **Correct Product (B):** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect.** It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n    *   Product: Correct.\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect.**\n    *   Product: **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: Correct.\n    *   Product: **Incorrect.** This product implies hydrolysis occurred without the key alkylation step.\n\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Correct.** It shows the proper sequential addition of reagents.\n    *   Product: **Correct.** It correctly identifies the product as heptan-4-one.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only choice that is entirely correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Chemical Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate. The core carbon skeleton that will be modified is that of **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reagents provided in the options (LDA, an alkylating agent, and acid) indicate that the overall reaction is an **α-alkylation of a ketone**. The goal is to add an alkyl group (in this case, an ethyl group from ethyl iodide) to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl group.\n\n### **2. Determining the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nThis is a multi-step synthesis that requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition to be successful.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The order of operations is critical.** The reaction cannot proceed if the reagents are added in the wrong order or all at once.\n    *   **Step (i) - Nucleophile Formation:** The reaction must start by creating a nucleophile. The strong, non-nucleophilic base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This is done in a suitable solvent like **DME**. This must be the first step.\n    *   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine formed in the first step then attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**. This forms a new, larger iminium salt. This must be the second step.\n    *   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the iminium salt back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Avoid neutralization.** A strong base (LDA) and a strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would simply neutralize each other, preventing the desired reaction. Therefore, any option that suggests mixing them in the same step is chemically incorrect.\n\nThe only chemically sound sequence for (A) is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **3. Predicting the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity of deprotonation.** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Kinetic Control:** The base used, LDA, is **sterically bulky**. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as kinetic control. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** Deprotonation occurs at C1, and the subsequent alkylation with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to this position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (a heptane derivative). The carbonyl group is at position 4 when numbering from either end. The correct IUPAC name for the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **4.

Let's evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Sequence (A): Correct.** The reagents are added sequentially and in the correct order.\n    *   **Product (B): Correct.** The product is heptan-4-one, which results from kinetically controlled alkylation.\n    *   **This option is fully correct.**\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Sequence (A): Incorrect.** It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step, which is chemically invalid.\n    *   **Product (B):** Correct.\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   **Sequence (A):** Correct.\n    *   **Product (B): Incorrect.** This shows the result of hydrolysis without the crucial alkylation step.\n\n*   **D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   **Sequence (A): Incorrect.**\n    *   **Product (B): Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A is entirely correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the chemical principles involved, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\n\nThe reaction is an α-alkylation of a ketone via an iminium salt intermediate. This is a multi-step synthesis where the order of reagent addition is crucial to the outcome.\n\n*   **Step (i): Nucleophile Formation.** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. The strong, non-nucleophilic base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This is performed in a suitable solvent like **DME**.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophile formed in the first step attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Sequential addition is mandatory.** A strong base (LDA) and a strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would instantly neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect. The only correct sequence is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Final Product (B)**\n\nThe structure of the final product is determined by where the alkyl group is added.\n\n*   **Starting Skeleton:** The name `pentan-2-ylidene` indicates the carbon skeleton is from **pentan-2-one**: `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **α-Carbons:** This ketone has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity is determined by the bulky base.** The base used, **LDA**, is sterically bulky. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** Deprotonation occurs at C1, and the subsequent alkylation with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to this position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct IUPAC Naming.** The final product is a symmetrical ketone with a seven-carbon chain. Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at the 4th position. The correct IUPAC name for product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluation of the Options**\n\nThe correct option must have **both** the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n\n*   **Correct Sequence (A):** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`\n*   **Correct Product (B):** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Sequence:** Correct. The reagents are added sequentially and in the proper order.\n    *   **Product:** Correct. The product of kinetic alkylation is correctly identified.\n    *   **This option is fully correct.**\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Sequence:** Incorrect. It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step, violating Careful Point 1.\n    *   **Product:** Correct.\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   **Sequence:** Correct.\n    *   **Product:** Incorrect. This shows the result of hydrolysis without the essential alkylation step.\n\n*   **D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   **Sequence:** Incorrect.\n    *   **Product:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A is entirely correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental chemical principles of the reaction, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires us to identify two key pieces of information: the correct sequence of reagents (A) and the structure of the final product (B).\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\n\nThe reaction is an α-alkylation of a ketone, which proceeds in three distinct stages. The order of reagent addition is critical for the reaction to succeed.\n\n*   **Step (i) - Nucleophile Formation:** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. The strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This is performed in a suitable solvent like **DME**. This must be the first step.\n*   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The nucleophile formed in the first step attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**. This must be the second step.\n*   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Critical.** The strong base (LDA) and the strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time. If they were, they would immediately neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation from occurring. Therefore, any option that groups the base and acid in the same step is chemically incorrect. The only correct sequence is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Final Product (B)**\n\nThe structure of the final product is determined by where the alkyl group is added.\n\n*   **Starting Skeleton:** The name `pentan-2-ylidene` indicates the carbon skeleton is from **pentan-2-one**: `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity.** This ketone has two different α-carbons where a proton can be removed: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Kinetic Control by a Bulky Base.** The base used, **LDA**, is known for being very large and sterically hindered. Due to its bulk, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is significantly less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** Deprotonation occurs at C1, and the subsequent reaction with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to this position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Naming the Product.** The final product is a symmetrical ketone with a seven-carbon chain (a heptanone). The carbonyl group is at the 4th position when numbering from either end. The correct IUPAC name for product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe must find the option that has **both** the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n\n*   **Correct Sequence (A):** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+`\n*   **Correct Product (B):** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: **Correct**.\n    *   Product: **Incorrect**. This product implies hydrolysis occurred without the key alkylation step.\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect**. It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n    *   Product: **Correct**.\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect**.\n    *   Product: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Correct**. It shows the proper sequential addition of reagents.\n    *   Product: **Correct**. It correctly identifies the product as heptan-4-one.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only choice that is entirely correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental chemical principles of the reaction, here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to identify the correct sequence of reagents (A) and the correct final product (B) for the α-alkylation of pentan-2-one via its iminium salt.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\n\nThe reaction is a multi-step synthesis that requires a specific order of operations to be successful.\n\n*   **Step (i): Nucleophile Formation.** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. The strong, sterically hindered base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This is performed in a solvent like **DME**. This must be the first step.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The enamine formed in the first step then attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**, to form a new carbon-carbon bond. This must be the second step.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product.

Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect. The only correct sequence is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Final Product (B)**\n\nThe structure of the final product is determined by the site of alkylation.\n\n*   **Starting Skeleton:** The name `pentan-2-ylidene` indicates the carbon skeleton is from **pentan-2-one**: `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity and Kinetic Control.** The starting ketone has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. The base used, **LDA**, is very large and sterically bulky. Due to its size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as **kinetic control**.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) from ethyl iodide is added to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming.** To name the product, we find the longest carbon chain, which has 7 carbons (a heptane derivative). Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The correct IUPAC name for product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nThe correct option must have **both** the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.

This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reagents provided (`LDA`, `CH3CH2I`, `H3O+`) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone** via a Stork enamine synthesis. The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nThis is a multi-step synthesis where the order of reagent addition is crucial for the reaction to succeed.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Mandatory.** The reaction proceeds in three distinct stages that must be performed in order.\n    1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** A strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used in a solvent like **DME** to deprotonate the α-carbon, creating a nucleophile (an enamine). This must be the first step.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The newly formed nucleophile attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I** (ethyl iodide). This must be the second step.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Incompatible Reagents.** A strong base (LDA) and a strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would immediately neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, any option that groups these reagents in the same step is chemically incorrect.\n\nThe only chemically sound sequence for (A) is: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the Final Product (B)**\n\nThe identity of the final product is determined by which α-carbon is alkylated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity and Kinetic Control.** The starting ketone, pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), has two different α-carbons where a proton can be removed: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. The base used, **LDA**, is famously large and sterically hindered. Due to its bulk, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Product Structure and Naming.** Alkylation with an ethyl group occurs at the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). The final structure after hydrolysis is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.

Identify the Core Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**.\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reagents listed (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone** via a Stork enamine synthesis. The goal is to add an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nThis is a multi-step synthesis where the order of reagent addition is critical.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Mandatory.** The reaction requires three distinct chemical transformations that must occur in a specific order.\n    1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** A strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used in a solvent like **DME** to remove an α-proton and create a nucleophile (an enamine). This must be the first step.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The newly formed nucleophile attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I** (ethyl iodide). This must be the second step.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to convert the intermediate back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n*   **Conclusion on Sequence:** The only chemically sound sequence is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. Any option that groups the strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) in the same step is incorrect, as they would simply neutralize each other.\n\n**3. Determine the Final Product (B)**\nThe structure of the final product depends on which α-carbon is alkylated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity and the Bulky Base.** The starting ketone, pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), has two different α-carbons where a proton can be removed: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Kinetic Control.** The base used, **LDA**, is famously large and sterically hindered. Due to its bulk, it preferentially attacks the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as kinetic control. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Conclusion on Product:** Alkylation occurs at the C1 position. An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) is added, converting the original C1 methyl group into a propyl group (`CH₃CH₂-CH₂-`). The final structure after hydrolysis is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`. The correct IUPAC name for this symmetrical 7-carbon ketone is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nThe correct choice must have **both** the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.\n\n*   **A) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   **Sequence:** Correct. The reagents are added sequentially and in the proper order.\n    *   **Product:** Correct. The product is heptan-4-one, resulting from kinetically controlled alkylation.\n    *   **This option is fully correct.**\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   **Sequence:** Incorrect.

This product implies hydrolysis occurred without the key alkylation step.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A is entirely correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the correct sequence of reagents and the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n\nThe reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**. The reagents listed in the options (`LDA`, `CH3CH2I`, `H3O+`) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone**, a key transformation in organic synthesis. The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nA multi-step synthesis requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition to be successful and avoid unwanted side reactions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The order of operations is critical.** The reaction must be performed in a specific sequence.\n    1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. The strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used to deprotonate the iminium salt at an α-carbon, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This step is performed in a suitable solvent like **DME (dimethoxyethane)**. This must be the first step.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The nucleophile formed in the first step then attacks the electrophile. Here, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)** is the alkylating agent. This must be the second step.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** The final step is an acidic aqueous workup, represented by **H₃O⁺**, to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone. This must be the last step.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Avoid Incompatible Reagents.** The strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present at the same time, as they would neutralize each other, preventing the desired reaction. Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect.\n\nBased on this, the only chemically sound sequence for (A) is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 3: Predict the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity of Deprotonation.** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Kinetic Control with a Bulky Base.** The base used, **LDA**, is sterically bulky. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** α-carbon. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is significantly less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** The enamine formed attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the resulting ketone has the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The product has a 7-carbon chain (heptane) with the carbonyl group at position 4. The correct IUPAC name of the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Final Decision**\n\nWe must find the option that has **both** the correct reagent sequence (A) and the correct final product (B).\n\n*   **Correct Sequence (A):** `(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺`\n*   **Correct Product (B):** `heptan-4-one`\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect.** It improperly groups the solvent, alkylating agent, and acid in the second step.\n    *   Product: Correct.\n\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+, B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: **Incorrect.**\n    *   Product: **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine**\n    *   Sequence: Correct.\n    *   Product: **Incorrect.** This product implies hydrolysis occurred without the key alkylation step.\n\n*   **D) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = heptan-4-one**\n    *   Sequence: **Correct.** It shows the proper sequential addition of reagents.\n    *   Product: **Correct.** It correctly identifies the product as heptan-4-one.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the only choice that is entirely correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

The core carbon skeleton that will be modified is that of **pentan-2-one** (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reagents provided in the options (LDA, an alkylating agent, and acid) indicate that the overall reaction is an **α-alkylation of a ketone**. The goal is to add an alkyl group (in this case, an ethyl group from ethyl iodide) to the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the original carbonyl group.\n\n### **2. Determining the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\n\nThis is a multi-step synthesis that requires a specific, logical order of reagent addition to be successful.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The order of operations is critical.** The reaction cannot proceed if the reagents are added in the wrong order or all at once.\n    *   **Step (i) - Nucleophile Formation:** The reaction must start by creating a nucleophile. The strong, non-nucleophilic base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This is done in a suitable solvent like **DME**. This must be the first step.\n    *   **Step (ii) - Alkylation:** The enamine formed in the first step then attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**. This forms a new, larger iminium salt. This must be the second step.\n    *   **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the iminium salt back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Avoid neutralization.** A strong base (LDA) and a strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would simply neutralize each other, preventing the desired reaction. Therefore, any option that suggests mixing them in the same step is chemically incorrect.\n\nThe only chemically sound sequence for (A) is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **3. Predicting the Final Product (B)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity of deprotonation.** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Kinetic Control:** The base used, LDA, is **sterically bulky**. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as kinetic control. The C1 methyl group is less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** Deprotonation occurs at C1, and the subsequent alkylation with ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) to this position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (a heptane derivative). The carbonyl group is at position 4 when numbering from either end. The correct IUPAC name for the product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### **4.

Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\nThe reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**. The reagents provided (`LDA`, `CH3CH2I`, `H3O+`) are characteristic of an α-alkylation of a ketone via an enamine intermediate (a Stork enamine synthesis). The overall goal is to add an ethyl group to the carbon skeleton of pentan-2-one.\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Sequence of Reagents (A)**\nThis is a multi-step synthesis, and the order of reagent addition is critical for the reaction to succeed.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Mandatory.** The reaction requires three distinct chemical transformations: deprotonation to form a nucleophile, alkylation with an electrophile, and hydrolysis to regenerate the ketone. These must occur in a specific sequence.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** A strong base, **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is used to remove an acidic α-proton, creating a nucleophile (an enamine). This must be the first step. **DME** is the solvent.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The newly formed nucleophile attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I** (ethyl iodide). This must be the second step.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to convert the intermediate back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The only chemically sound sequence is **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**. Any option that suggests mixing the strong base (LDA) and the strong acid (H₃O⁺) in the same step is incorrect, as they would simply neutralize each other.\n\n**3. Predict the Final Product (B)**\nThe structure of the final product depends on which α-carbon is alkylated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity due to a Bulky Base.** The starting ketone skeleton, pentan-2-one (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), has two different α-carbons where a proton can be removed: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. The base used, **LDA**, is famously large and sterically hindered. Due to its bulk, it preferentially attacks the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as **kinetic control**. The C1 methyl group is less sterically hindered than the C3 methylene group. Therefore, deprotonation and subsequent alkylation will occur at the C1 position.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Structure and IUPAC Name.** An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) is added to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`CH₃CH₂-CH₂-`). The final structure after hydrolysis is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.

Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n*   The reaction begins with `(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium`. This is an iminium salt, which is a reactive intermediate derived from the ketone **pentan-2-one**.\n*   The reagents involved (LDA, an alkyl halide, and acid) are characteristic of an **α-alkylation of a ketone**, a variant of the Stork enamine synthesis.

The strong, bulky base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used in a solvent like **DME** to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enamine formed in the first step then attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**.\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Incompatible Reagents.** A strong base (LDA) and a strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would immediately neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation.

Determination of the Final Product (B)**\nThe identity of the final product depends on which α-carbon is alkylated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Regioselectivity and Kinetic Control.** The starting pentan-2-one skeleton (`CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3.\n*   **Role of the Bulky Base:** The base used, **LDA**, is sterically bulky. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position. This is known as *kinetic control*. The C1 methyl group is significantly less hindered than the C3 methylene group.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** Therefore, deprotonation and subsequent alkylation with ethyl iodide occur at the C1 position.

Analysis of the Reagent Sequence (A)**\n\nThe reaction is a multi-step synthesis that requires a specific order of operations to be successful.\n\n*   **Step (i): Nucleophile Formation.** The reaction must begin by creating a nucleophile. The strong, sterically hindered base **LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)** is used to deprotonate the carbon alpha (α) to the iminium group, forming a nucleophilic enamine. This is performed in a solvent like **DME**. This must be the first step.\n*   **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The enamine formed in the first step then attacks the electrophilic alkylating agent, **CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**, to form a new carbon-carbon bond. This must be the second step.\n*   **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Finally, an acidic aqueous workup with **H₃O⁺** is used to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back into the final ketone product. This must be the last step.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sequential Addition is Critical.** The strong base (LDA) and strong acid (H₃O⁺) cannot be present in the reaction mixture at the same time, as they would instantly neutralize each other, preventing the desired alkylation. Therefore, any option that groups them in the same step is chemically incorrect. The only correct sequence is the sequential addition: **(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Final Product (B)**\n\nThe structure of the final product is determined by the site of alkylation.\n\n*   **Starting Skeleton:** The name `pentan-2-ylidene` indicates the carbon skeleton is from **pentan-2-one**: `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity and Kinetic Control.** The starting ketone has two different α-carbons where deprotonation can occur: the methyl group at C1 and the methylene group at C3. The base used, **LDA**, is very large and sterically bulky. Due to its size, it preferentially removes a proton from the **less sterically hindered** position, which is the C1 methyl group. This is known as **kinetic control**.\n*   **Alkylation and Final Structure:** An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) from ethyl iodide is added to the C1 position. The original C1 methyl group (`-CH₃`) is thus converted into a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). After hydrolysis, the final product's structure is `CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: IUPAC Naming.** To name the product, we find the longest carbon chain, which has 7 carbons (a heptane derivative). Numbering from either end places the carbonyl group at position 4. The correct IUPAC name for product (B) is **heptan-4-one**.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nThe correct option must have **both** the correct reagent sequence and the correct final product.
