This process is governed by the fundamental conservation laws of energy and momentum. Since the rest mass of the initial particles is converted into a large amount of energy, the resulting particles will travel at speeds close to the speed of light, necessitating the use of formulas from Special Relativity.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**:\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a standard physics simplification implying its kinetic energy is negligible.\n    *   To conserve momentum (which is initially near-zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame where both particles are effectively at rest. The total initial momentum is therefore zero.\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. A proton and antiproton have the same mass. The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is a known physical constant, approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Distribute Energy to Final Particles**:\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.

We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity ($v$) as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$.\n    *   This gives $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The calculated velocity is approximately **0.77c**.\n    *   Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n        A) 0.86c\n        B) 0.96c\n        C) 0.77c\n        D) 0.91c\n    *   The calculated value matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: The fact that all 15 candidate answers arrived at the same numerical result of ~0.77c demonstrates the correctness and robustness of the physical reasoning and calculation.\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" Approximation**: This is a critical simplification. It allows us to ignore any initial kinetic energy and analyze the problem in a zero-momentum reference frame, where the initial energy is purely the rest energy of the two particles.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics**: The kinetic energy of each final particle ($E_k = E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of its rest energy (300 MeV).

Every answer that showed its work correctly derived a velocity of approximately 0.77c.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy**: The only discrepancy among the candidate answers was the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is because the options were presented to the agents in a different, randomized order. This confirms that the physics calculation itself is extremely robust and the variation was in the test setup, not the reasoning.\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" Approximation**: It is critical to interpret this phrase as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible. This simplifies the initial state to a system at rest, where the total energy is the sum of the rest energies and the initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics**: The kinetic energy of each final particle ($E_k = E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of its rest energy (300 MeV).

They all correctly interpret \"slowly moving\" to mean the initial kinetic energy is negligible. Every agent that performs the calculation arrives at the same numerical result: the velocity of particle A is approximately **0.77c**. The only discrepancy is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is because the options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.

Since the initial particles' rest mass is converted into a large amount of energy, the resulting particles will travel at speeds close to the speed of light, necessitating the use of **special relativity**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**: The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The phrase \"slowly moving\" is a standard simplification indicating that the initial kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the process can be analyzed in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is a known physical constant, approximately 938.3 MeV. An antiproton has an identical mass and thus the same rest energy.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Distribute Energy to the Final Particles**: The annihilation produces four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$), all with the same given rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   By the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of identical mass), the total initial energy is distributed equally among them.\n    *   The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n        $E_A = \\frac{E_{initial}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**: The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n    *   Next, we solve for the velocity ($v$) from the definition of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$.\n    *   This gives $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated velocity of particle A is approximately $0.769c$, which rounds to **0.77c**. Comparing this result to the options provided:\n    *   A) 0.77c\n    *   B) 0.96c\n    *   C) 0.91c\n    *   D) 0.86c\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers show a unanimous consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps, with all calculations yielding a velocity of approximately 0.77c. This demonstrates the robustness of the result.\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" Approximation**: It is critical to interpret this phrase as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible. This simplifies the initial energy calculation to only the rest energies and establishes a zero-momentum frame for the interaction.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics**: The kinetic energy of each final particle ($E_k = E_A - m_A c^2 \\approx 169$ MeV) is a significant fraction of its rest energy (300 MeV).
