    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant's structure and molecular formula.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n    *   **cyclohex**: A six-membered carbon ring. This accounts for 1 unit of IHD.\n    *   **-3-ene**: A carbon-carbon double bond within the ring. This adds another unit of IHD.\n    *   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. This contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one unit of IHD.\n    *   **-formyl**: A -CHO group. This also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding another unit of IHD.\n    *   **-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group. This contains a carbon-carbon double bond, adding one more unit of IHD.\n\n    So, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of contributions from all rings and double bonds:\n    IHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n    Let's also determine the molecular formula to verify this.\n    *   Carbon atoms (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms (H): We need to carefully count them on the structure.\n        *   C1 (with COOH): 1 H\n        *   C2 (with CHO): 1 H\n        *   C3 (=CH-): 1 H\n        *   C4 (-CH=): 1 H\n        *   C5 (with vinyl): 1 H\n        *   C6 (-CH2-): 2 H\n        *   -COOH: 1 H\n        *   -CHO: 1 H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3 H\n        *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   Oxygen atoms (O): 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula is C10H12O3.\n\n    The formula for IHD is IHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1. For C10H12O3, this is:\n    IHD = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the Clemmensen-like reduction of almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and the hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds.\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Applying the effects of the Red P + HI reagent to the reactant:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (at position 3) is reduced to a single bond.\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, based on the reactant's numbering, it would be 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. The key feature of this product is that it is a saturated cycloalkane. It consists of a cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents. All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been eliminated.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD of a molecule is the number of rings plus the number of double bonds (plus twice the number of triple bonds).\n    *   The product molecule (1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane) contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   There are no double or triple bonds in the product, as they have all been reduced.\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product is 1.\n\n    We can also calculate this using the molecular formula of the product. The reduction process does not change the number of carbon atoms, so the product has 10 carbon atoms (C10). The parent saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would be C10H(2*10 + 2) = C10H22. Since the product has one ring, two hydrogen atoms are removed from the saturated acyclic formula, making the product's formula C10H20.\n    Using the IHD formula for C10H20:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated IHD is 1.\n    A) 5\n    B) 3\n    C) 1\n    D) 0\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
