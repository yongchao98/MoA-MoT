    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space.\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix:**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n    In the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, the vectors are $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The outer products are:\n    $|0\\rangle \\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|1\\rangle \\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The term $\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|$ is the sum of these two matrices:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$\n    This is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$.\n    So, the density matrix can be written as:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    This state is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Sphere:**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ can be represented by a point inside or on the surface of a unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, known as the Bloch sphere. The relationship is given by:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where:\n    *   $I$ is the identity matrix.\n    *   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the coordinates of the state in the Bloch sphere.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n3.  **Determine the Bloch Vector $\\vec{r}$:**\n    We can find the vector $\\vec{r}$ by equating our specific density matrix with the general form:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n    In matrix form:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = r_x \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + r_y \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + r_z \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_z & r_x - ir_y \\\\ r_x + ir_y & -r_z \\end{pmatrix}$\n    For this matrix equality to hold, each corresponding element must be equal:\n    *   $r_z = 0$\n    *   $r_x - ir_y = 0$\n    *   $r_x + ir_y = 0$\n    *   $-r_z = 0$\n    From the first or fourth equation, we have $r_z = 0$.\n    Adding the second and third equations gives $2r_x = 0$, so $r_x = 0$.\n    Substituting $r_x=0$ into the second equation gives $-ir_y=0$, so $r_y=0$.\n    Therefore, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Alternative Method (using Trace):**\n    The components of the Bloch vector can also be calculated directly using the formula:\n    $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$ for $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n    Given $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$:\n    *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n    This confirms that the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}I$ in the qubit space (Bloch sphere) is the origin. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which sits at the center of the sphere.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,0)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(1,1,1)\nD) r=(0,0,1)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
