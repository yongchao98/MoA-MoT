    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:**\n    *   It is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This chemical shift is in the alkene region, and a single peak implies all protons are equivalent.\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows two peaks: 165 ppm (typical for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride) and 137 ppm (typical for an alkene carbon conjugated to a carbonyl).\n    *   These spectral data perfectly match **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**. The two alkene protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, giving a singlet at ~7 ppm. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n\n*   **The Diene:**\n    *   The diene is named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula. Cyclopentadiene (C₅H₆) has four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and two hydrogens on the saturated carbon (C5).\n    *   Replacing the four hydrogens on C1-C4 with methyl groups gives a structure with the formula C₅(CH₃)₄H₂.\n    *   Let's count the atoms: C = 5 (ring) + 4 (methyls) = 9. H = 12 (methyls) + 2 (on C5) = 14.\n    *   So, the diene's formula is **C₉H₁₄**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the products.**\n\n*   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   Let's check the molecular formula of the product: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) → **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative: **1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n*   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. These are the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the major and minor products.**\n\n*   The **endo rule** for Diels-Alder reactions predicts that the kinetic product (usually the major product formed at lower temperatures) is the *endo* isomer. This is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, the diene is heavily substituted with four methyl groups. The two methyl groups at C1 and C4 of the diene become bridgehead substituents in the product. These create significant steric hindrance.\n*   In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride ring tucks \"under\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the bridgehead methyl groups.\n*   In the *exo* transition state, the anhydride ring points away, avoiding this clash.\n*   In cases of significant steric hindrance, the steric effect can override the electronic preference, making the *exo* isomer the kinetic (major) product. Therefore, it is highly likely that the **major product is the *exo* isomer** and the minor product is the *endo* isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stereochemistry and predict the NOESY cross-peak.**\n\n*   Let's analyze the spatial arrangement of protons in both isomers. We are interested in the protons on the anhydride part (H2, H3) and their proximity to other groups.\n    *   In a bicyclo[2.2.1] system, a substituent at C2/C3 is *exo* if it's on the same side as the C7 bridge, and *endo* if it's on the opposite side.\n    *   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position (pointing away from the C5=C6 double bond). Consequently, the H2 and H3 protons are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C5=C6 double bond and its methyl substituents. This proximity will lead to a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE).\n    *   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is in the *endo* position. Consequently, the H2 and H3 protons are in the *exo* position, pointing towards the C7 bridge. They are far from the C5=C6 double bond.\n\n*   **Assign the NMR signals from the options:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the anhydride moiety (H2, H3). Their chemical shift is high due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl groups. They are a singlet because their neighboring carbons (C1, C4) have no protons.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the C5=C6 double bond. The chemical shift is typical for vinylic methyls.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This signal corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). The chemical shift is typical for methyl groups on a quaternary carbon.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This likely corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n*   **Identify the distinguishing cross-peak:**\n    *   The question states the cross-peak is present in the major product and absent in the minor one.\n    *   Since the major product is the *exo* isomer, we expect an NOE between the *endo*-protons (H2, H3) and the substituents on the C5=C6 double bond (the two methyl groups).\n    *   This means there should be a cross-peak connecting the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n*   **Match with the options:**\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's double-check: In the minor (*endo*) product, this cross-peak would be absent because H2 and H3 are far from the C5=C6 methyl groups. This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
