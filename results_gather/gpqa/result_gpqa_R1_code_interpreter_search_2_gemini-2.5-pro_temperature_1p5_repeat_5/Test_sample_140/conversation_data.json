    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position C2.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction involving an aryl halide and a strong base. The mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne** (or aryne).\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide anion (`NH₂⁻`) is a strong base that removes a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    Since both H and D are present at the ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The `NH₂⁻` base abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C6 induces the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n        *   This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   *Note:* Breaking a C-H bond is kinetically more favorable (faster) than breaking a C-D bond due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). Therefore, this is the major pathway.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The `NH₂⁻` base abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C2 induces the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the ring.\n        *   This intermediate is the standard, unsubstituted **benzyne**.\n        *   *Note:* Although slower than Pathway A, this pathway is still possible. Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider it.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The amide anion (`NH₂⁻`) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The benzyne has a triple bond between C1 and C6, with a deuterium at C2. The nucleophile `NH₂⁻` can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. This anion is protonated by the NH₃ solvent. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. This anion is protonated by the NH₃ solvent. The product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the C1 position, the deuterium is at the C3 position. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate B (unsubstituted benzyne):**\n        *   The benzyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2, with no deuterium on the ring.\n        *   The nucleophile `NH₂⁻` attacks one of the carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C2). Due to symmetry, both attacks lead to the same result.\n        *   Attack at C1 forms a carbanion at C2. This anion is protonated by the NH₃ solvent.\n        *   The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and a hydrogen at C2 (from the solvent). This product is simply **aniline**. (The deuterium abstracted in Step 1 becomes part of the solvent pool as NDH₂, but since NH₃ is in vast excess, the probability of re-incorporating the deuterium is negligible).\n\n4.  **Summary of Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n    1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n    2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n    3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\n    No other isomers, such as 4-deuteroaniline, can be formed through the benzyne mechanism in this reaction. Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
