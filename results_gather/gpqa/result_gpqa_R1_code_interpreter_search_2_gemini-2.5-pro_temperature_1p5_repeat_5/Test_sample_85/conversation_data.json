    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) named `tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This indicates a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group. The ethyl group is at position 4, and this C4 carbon is the stereocenter, which can be either (R) or (S). A lactone like this is typically formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid through intramolecular cyclization.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are all based on \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decipher this name, which appears to be a derivative of a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid.\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). Let's assume this is at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) is on C3. This C3 is the chiral center of the starting material.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes the group at C5. It has a double-bonded oxygen (`=O`, oxo) and an isobutoxy group (`-OCH2CH(CH3)2`). Together, this describes an isobutyl ester group: `-C(=O)OCH2CH(CH3)2`.\n\nSo, the starting material is the mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid). Its structure is:\n`iBu-OOC-CH₂(C5)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)`\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a relatively mild reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it is selective for esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters as well, but generally more slowly than carboxylic acids. Thus, it is selective for carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction):** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    `iBuOOC-CH₂(C5)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)` → `HO-CH₂(C5')-CH₂(C4)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)`\n    The intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Step 2 (Cyclization):** Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a stable six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. The C3 stereocenter of the starting material becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction):** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    `iBu-OOC-CH₂(C5)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)` → `iBu-OOC-CH₂(C5)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-CH₂OH(C1')`\n    The intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Step 2 (Cyclization):** Under acidic workup (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl group at C1' attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester at C5. This is a transesterification reaction, and isobutanol is eliminated to form the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. The C3 stereocenter of the starting material becomes the C4 stereocenter of the lactone.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**6. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B is the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
