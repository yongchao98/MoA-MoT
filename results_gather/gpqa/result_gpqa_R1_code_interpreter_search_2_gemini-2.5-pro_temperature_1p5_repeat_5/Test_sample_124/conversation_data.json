    "An analysis of the quantum mechanical system described by the potential $V(r) = 1/2 m \\omega^2 r^2$ is presented below. This potential corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The Schrödinger equation for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating variables in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n    $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n    The energy levels of a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n    Thus, the total energy of the 3D system is:\n    $E = (n_x + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$\n\n2.  **Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    We can now determine the energy for the first few states by finding the value of $n$:\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $n=0$ ($n_x=n_y=n_z=0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\n    This is a combinatorial problem. The number of ways to partition an integer $n$ into a sum of $k$ non-negative integers is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \\frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!}$\n    In our case, $n=3$ (for the third excited state) and $k=3$ (for the three dimensions).\n    $g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- 3 states\n    *   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- 6 states\n    *   (1, 1, 1) and its permutations: (1,1,1) --- 1 state\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n    Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The degeneracy of this state is 10.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$, 3\n    B) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$\n    C) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$\n    D) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$\n\n    The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
