    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (let's call this `dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (let's call this `dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`).\n    The given relationship is:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to a star.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connect the Rates of Change using the Chain Rule:** We want to find `dN/dr` and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to find how parallax changes with respect to distance. We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹` and differentiate it with respect to `r`.\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now we substitute the known pieces back into the chain rule equation.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n    The expression is currently in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need it solely in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`.\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    Now substitute this back into our proportionality:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n8.  **Interpret the Result:** The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but the question asks \"How does the number of stars ... change\", which refers to the magnitude of the relationship or the functional dependence. The number of stars in a distance shell cannot be negative. Therefore, we look at the proportionality of the magnitude.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of distance in that region of the sky scales as the cube of the distance.\n\n9.  **Match with Options:**\n    A) ~ r^5\n    B) ~ r^3\n    C) ~ r^4\n    D) ~ r^2\n\n    Our result `r³` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
