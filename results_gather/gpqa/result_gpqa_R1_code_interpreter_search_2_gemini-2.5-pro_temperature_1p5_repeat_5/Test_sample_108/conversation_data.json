    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which decay is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a **1S0** state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n- The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n- **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_initial = 0`.\n- **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' indicates `L_initial = 0`.\n- **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The '0' indicates `J_initial = 0`.\n- **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-body system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Decay Process\nThe decay is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n- Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n- The final state has a total angular momentum `J_final_total` which is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_final_NN`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`).\n- The total final parity `P_final_total` is the product of the final NN system's parity (`P_final_NN`), the intrinsic parity of X (`P(X)`), and the orbital parity from X's motion `(-1)^l_X`. So, `P_final_total = P_final_NN * P(X) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^L_final_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must check each potential decay against three rules:\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_initial = J_final_total`.\nSince `J_initial = 0`, the vector sum of `J_final_NN` and `l_X` must be zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal:\n`J_final_NN = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved. `P_initial = P_final_total`.\nWe found `P_initial = +1`, so we must have:\n`+1 = (-1)^L_final_NN * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = (-1)^L_final_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = (-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X + 1)`\nThis equation holds true only if the exponent `(L_final_NN + l_X + 1)` is an even number. This implies that `L_final_NN + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Principle for the Final State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy:\n`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\nGiven `T(NN) = 0` for the final state, this becomes:\n`0 = S_final_NN + L_final_NN + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis requires `(S_final_NN + L_final_NN + 1)` to be an even number, which means that `S_final_NN + L_final_NN` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\nNow we test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n- Final NN state (7D1): `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n- Particle X (p-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n- **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓ Pass)\nThis decay is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n- Final NN state (3D3): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n- Particle X (f-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n- **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `3 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓ Pass)\nThis decay is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n- Final NN state (3S1): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n- Particle X (p-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n- **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\nThis decay is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n- Final NN state (3P0): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n- Particle X (s-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n- **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `0 = 0`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)\n- **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 1 = 2`. (✗ Fail)\nThe sum `S_f + L_f` is even, which violates the Pauli principle condition for the T=0 final state.\n\nTherefore, the decay `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted.\n\n<<<D>>>"
