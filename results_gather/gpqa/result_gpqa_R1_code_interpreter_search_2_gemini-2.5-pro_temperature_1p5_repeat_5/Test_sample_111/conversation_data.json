    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and solution:\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State Vector `|alpha>`\n\nThe given state is `|α'> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`.\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state is:\n`|α'> = [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to divide it by its norm. The squared norm is given by `<α'|α'>`.\nThe bra vector `<α'|` is the conjugate transpose of `|α'>`:\n`<α'| = [1-i, 2+i]`\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product:\n`<α'|α'> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`= (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) `\n`= (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe norm is `sqrt(<α'|α'>) = sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|α> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>] = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n### 2. Finding Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of Operator A\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements:\n`Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`\n`Aij = 0` if `i = j`\n\nThis gives the 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\n\nThis can be written in terms of the Pauli-X matrix `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]` as `A = (hbar/2) * σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = +hbar/2`\n`λ₂ = -hbar/2`\n\nNow we find the corresponding eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] [a, b]^T = (hbar/2) [a, b]^T`\n    This gives the equations:\n    `(hbar/2) * b = (hbar/2) * a`  => `a = b`\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`. Normalizing it gives the first eigenstate:\n    `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(1²+1²)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `[[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] [a, b]^T = -(hbar/2) [a, b]^T`\n    This gives the equations:\n    `(hbar/2) * b = -(hbar/2) * a` => `b = -a`\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`. Normalizing it gives the second eigenstate:\n    `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(1²+(-1)²)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2 (state |v₁>):**\n    `P₁ = |<v₁|α>|²`\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [<up|((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>) + <down|((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2 (state |v₂>):**\n    `P₂ = |<v₂|α>|²`\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1 + i - 2 + i] = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Average (Expectation) Value\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)(+hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar / 28 = hbar / 7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    First, calculate `A|α>`:\n    `A|α> = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `= (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    Now, calculate `<α|A|α>`:\n    `<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `= (hbar/14) * [2] = 2*hbar / 14 = hbar / 7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same average value: `hbar / 7`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar / 7`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
