    "This question requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two organic reactions and then an understanding of how the resulting mixture of products is analyzed by two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, and we start with a single enantiomer. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is at C5.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral. Hydride attack can occur from two different faces, leading to either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new C3 center.\n*   Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5 ((S) configuration), the two possible products are:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. They are **diastereomers**. LAH is generally not highly diastereoselective without a nearby directing group, so we assume both diastereomers are formed.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, which are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This is an achiral molecule. Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this pair will be formed as a 50:50 mixture, i.e., a **racemic mixture**.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). Therefore, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is an achiral **meso compound**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a racemic mixture of two enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. We have a total of five different compounds in the mixture:\n*   From Rxn I: (3R, 5S)-alcohol and (3S, 5S)-alcohol (2 diastereomers).\n*   From Rxn II: (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol (enantiomeric pair), and meso-diol (3 stereoisomers).\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Products from Rxn I: The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   Products from Rxn II: The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, giving a second peak. This gives a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇ methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally different and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = 4 peaks.**\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   This technique uses a chiral environment to separate stereoisomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers.\n*   It **can** separate enantiomers.\n*   Products from Rxn I: The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   Products from Rxn II: The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks. The meso compound is achiral and will give a single peak, which is separated from the other two (as it is a diastereomer). This gives a total of **3 peaks** from Reaction II.\n*   Again, no accidental overlap is expected between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
