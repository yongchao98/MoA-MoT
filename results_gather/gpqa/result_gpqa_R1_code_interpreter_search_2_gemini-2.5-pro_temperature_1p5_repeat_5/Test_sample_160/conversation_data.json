    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the two mean free paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual *gas molecules colliding with each other*. The formula for this type of MFP is given by the kinetic theory of gases:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is essentially determined by the physical size of the molecules (a \"hard-sphere\" collision).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the gas molecules, which are all moving randomly.\n\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *electrons from the beam colliding with the gas molecules*. The formula for the MFP of a beam of particles hitting a stationary (or slow-moving) target is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section between an electron and a gas molecule.\n        *   Note the absence of the `√2` factor, as the electrons are in a high-speed, directed beam, and the gas molecules are comparatively stationary.\n\n2.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a kinetic collision between two neutral molecules. The interaction is very short-range, governed by van der Waals forces. For a collision to occur, the centers of the two molecules must approach each other within a distance equal to the molecular diameter. Thus, `σ_gg` is related to the physical, geometric size of the molecule (e.g., σ_gg ≈ πd², where d is the molecular diameter).\n\n    *   **Electron-Gas Collision (σ_eg):** This is a fundamentally different interaction. The electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron is scattered by the electric field created by the molecule's atomic nucleus (which is positive) and its surrounding electron cloud (which is negative). Because the Coulomb force has a long range (its influence extends far beyond the physical boundary of the molecule), an electron can be significantly deflected (i.e., \"collide\" or \"scatter\") even when it is far from the molecule. This makes the effective target area, `σ_eg`, much larger than the purely geometric cross-section, `σ_gg`.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Comparison:**\n    *   We have established that the electron-gas scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section: `σ_eg > σ_gg`. In fact, it's typically significantly larger.\n    *   Now let's compare the denominators of the MFP formulas:\n        *   Denominator for λ1: `√2 * n * σ_gg`\n        *   Denominator for λ2: `n * σ_eg`\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is significantly larger than `σ_gg`, it is virtually certain that `n * σ_eg` is larger than `√2 * n * σ_gg`.\n    *   The mean free path is inversely proportional to its denominator. A larger denominator means a smaller MFP.\n    *   Because the denominator for λ2 is larger than the denominator for λ1, we can conclude that λ2 must be smaller than λ1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The electrons in the beam are much more likely to interact with the residual gas molecules than the gas molecules are to interact with each other. This higher probability of interaction (larger cross-section) for the electrons leads to a shorter average distance traveled between collisions. Therefore, the electron mean free path (λ2) is shorter than the gas molecule mean free path (λ1).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
