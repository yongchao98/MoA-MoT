    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** The problem assumes that stars are spread out uniformly in three-dimensional space. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the stellar density, let's call it `ρ`) is constant everywhere.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that `d = 1/plx`. A large parallax means a small distance, and a small parallax means a large distance.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:**\n    We want to find how the number of stars (`N`) per unit range of parallax (`plx`) varies with `plx`. Mathematically, we are looking for the functional form of the derivative `dN/d(plx)`.\n\n3.  **Count the stars as a function of distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the stellar density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   This equation tells us how the number of stars changes with distance. It shows that the number of stars in a shell of fixed thickness `dd` increases with the square of the distance (`d²`).\n\n4.  **Change variables from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship in terms of parallax, not distance. So, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When considering the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that as `d` increases, `plx` decreases).\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Combine the equations to get the final relationship:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx² * d(plx))`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The term `4πρ` is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    Number of stars per unit parallax ~ `1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
