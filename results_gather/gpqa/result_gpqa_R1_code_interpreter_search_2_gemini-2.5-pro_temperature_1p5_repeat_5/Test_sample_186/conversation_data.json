    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Detection Criteria\nA star is considered detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT if it meets two conditions:\n1.  **Brightness Condition:** It must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n2.  **Observability Condition:** It must be visible from the location of the telescope, which is the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Magnitude (Brightness Condition)\nI need to find the faintest apparent V-band magnitude (m_V) that ESPRESSO can detect under the given conditions. The provided ESO link for ESPRESSO contains this information in the \"Expected Performance\" section:\n> \"...delivering S/N=10 per pixel at 550 nm for a V=16 mag G2V star in a 1 hour exposure.\"\n\nThis statement establishes that the limiting apparent magnitude for our detection criteria is **m_V = 16**. Any star with an apparent magnitude `m_V <= 16` is bright enough to be detected.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Observability Window (Observability Condition)\nESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, located at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A celestial object's visibility depends on its declination (DEC). Objects with a very high positive (northern) declination will not rise above the horizon. A practical limit for high-quality observations (avoiding high airmass) is that the object's declination should be less than approximately +35°. Any star with a declination significantly above this limit is not observable.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Star\nNow, I will evaluate each star against the two conditions. For stars c, d, e, and f, I will need to calculate their apparent magnitude `m_V` from their absolute magnitude `M_V` and distance `d` using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `d` is in parsecs.\n\n*   **a) Canopus**\n    *   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52.7°. This is well within the observable range from Paranal's southern latitude.\n    *   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is `m_V = -0.74`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since -0.74 <= 16 and it is observable, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n*   **b) Polaris**\n    *   **Observability:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89.3°. This is far outside the observable range from Paranal (DEC < +35°).\n    *   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is `m_V = +1.98`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Although it is bright enough, it is not visible from the telescope's location. **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc**\n    *   **Observability:** The declination is 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 15 <= 16` and it is observable, **this star is detectable.**\n\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n    *   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(2.301) - 5 ≈ 21.5`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 21.5 > 16`, this star is too faint. **It is not detectable.**\n\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n    *   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(0.699) - 5 ≈ 13.5`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 13.5 <= 16` and it is observable, **this star is detectable.**\n\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n    *   **Observability:** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(1.699) - 5 ≈ 18.5`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since `m_V = 18.5 > 16`, this star is too faint. **It is not detectable.**\n\n### Final Count\nThe stars that are detectable are:\n1.

    "To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory, we need to check two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Is it bright enough?** The star's apparent magnitude (`m_V`) must be less than or equal to the limiting magnitude for the required signal-to-noise ratio.\n2.  **Is it visible from the observatory?** The star's declination (DEC) must be within the observable range from the Paranal Observatory's southern latitude.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude**\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. The provided ESO link for ESPRESSO states under the \"Expected Performance\" section:\n> In its 1-UT mode, it is expected to reach a S/N=10 per pixel at 550 nm for a V=16 mag G2V star in a 1 hour exposure.\n\nThis means the limiting apparent magnitude for our criteria is **`m_V = 16`**. Any star with `m_V ≤ 16` is bright enough.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Observability from Paranal**\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. This southern location means it can easily observe the southern celestial hemisphere and parts of the northern one, but it cannot observe stars near the north celestial pole. Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89°, making it permanently below the horizon and thus **not observable** from Paranal.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nFor stars c, d, e, and f, we first need to calculate their apparent magnitude (`m_V`) from their given absolute magnitude (`M_V = 15`) and distance (`d`) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5` (where `d` is in parsecs).\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent magnitude `m_V = -0.74`. Since `-0.74 ≤ 16`, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is approximately -52.7°. This is well within the observable range from Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent magnitude `m_V = 1.98`. Since `1.98 ≤ 16`, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is approximately +89.3°. This is not visible from Paranal's southern latitude.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable**.\n\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc:**\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15`. Since `15 ≤ 16`, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc:**\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`. Since `21.5 > 16`, it is too faint.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc:**\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`. Since `13.5 ≤ 16`, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc:**\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`. Since `18.5 > 16`, it is too faint.\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable**.\n\n**Summary**\nThe detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc\n3.  Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc\n\nA total of **3** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
