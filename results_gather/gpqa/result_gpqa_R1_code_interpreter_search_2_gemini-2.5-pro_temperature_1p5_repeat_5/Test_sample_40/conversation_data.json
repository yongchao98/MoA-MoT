    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame), which is considered stationary.\n    *   Let `S'` be the frame of reference of the moving glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame `S`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass (frame `S'`) relative to the laboratory (frame `S`). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, so we can take this as a positive velocity `v`.\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame `S'`). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass (in its own rest frame) is `1/n`. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion, so `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   `u`: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame `S`). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:**\n    According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, when two velocities `u'` and `v` are in the same direction, the resultant velocity `u` as measured in the stationary frame is not simply `u' + v`. Instead, we must use the relativistic velocity-addition formula:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'*v / c^2))`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values and Simplify:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substitute these values into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n    This result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
