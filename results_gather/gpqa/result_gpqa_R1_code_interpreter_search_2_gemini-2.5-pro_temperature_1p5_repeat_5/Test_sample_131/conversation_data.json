    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given NMR data**\n\nWe are given the 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and symmetry of each option to predict its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single signal, a singlet, representing 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, representing 12H.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. They will appear as a single signal, a singlet, representing 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three distinct signals for the methyl groups.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing two doublets (an AX system), not two singlets. This immediately rules out Prehnitene as being one of the compounds, as the problem specifies two *singlets* in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** 2 aromatic doublets (1H each), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent and will produce a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The -CH2- protons will couple with the -CH3- protons, producing a quartet (4H). The -CH3- protons will couple with the -CH2- protons, producing a triplet (6H). The presence of quartets and triplets contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the analysis**\n\nFrom Step 2, we have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only two remaining possibilities are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This combination corresponds to option C. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Because they are different molecules, their singlets will appear at slightly different chemical shifts. Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals originate from 2 protons, the two singlets will have a 1:1 integration ratio. **This perfectly matches the problem description.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet corresponding to 12H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets corresponding to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   In total, we would expect four signals. However, the problem states only three signals are observed. This indicates an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of signals. The problem states the three observed signals have a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24H means the integrals of the three peaks must be 12H, 6H, and 6H (since (2/4)*24=12, (1/4)*24=6, (1/4)*24=6).\n    *   Let's see if we can form these signals from our two compounds:\n        *   **Signal 1 (12H):** This corresponds to the singlet from Durene's four equivalent methyl groups.\n        *   **Signal 2 (6H):** This corresponds to the singlet from Isodurene's C1 and C3 methyl groups.\n        *   **Signal 3 (6H):** This can be explained if the two 3H signals from Isodurene (from the C2-methyl and C5-methyl) are accidentally degenerate, meaning they have the same chemical shift and appear as a single peak.\n    *   This explanation is chemically plausible and perfectly accounts for the observation of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
