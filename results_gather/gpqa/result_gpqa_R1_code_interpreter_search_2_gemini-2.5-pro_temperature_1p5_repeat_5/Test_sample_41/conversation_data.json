    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n- $L$ is the luminosity of the star.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light reflected).\n- $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star, $L$ is the same for all of them. The problem states that the albedo $A$ is also the same for all three planets (A = 0.3). The values $16, \\pi, \\sigma$ are constants. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\propto \\frac{1}{a^{1/2}}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius. We can also write this relationship as:\n\n$a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n\n**2. Calculate the ratio of the orbital radii ($a_3 / a_1$).**\n\nFrom the proportionality $a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$, we can write the ratio of the orbital radii of two planets (x and y) as:\n\n$\\frac{a_x}{a_y} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,x}}{T_{eq,y}} \\right)^{-2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,y}}{T_{eq,x}} \\right)^{2}$\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n- $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n- $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$, which can be expressed as a product of known ratios:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\nUsing the relationship derived above:\n- $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\right)^{2} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n- $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^{2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\nNow, multiply these to get the final radius ratio:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = 1.96 \\times 5.29 = 10.3684$\n\n**3. Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius.**\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of the orbital period ($P$) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n$P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\nThe information about the planets' masses and the TTV method is extra information not needed for this calculation, as Kepler's third law in this form assumes the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_3 / P_1$).**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can find the ratio of the periods:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\nWe have already calculated $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684$. Plugging this value into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5}$\n\nTo compute this, we can use a calculator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given temperature ratios\nTeq1_div_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_div_Teq3 = 2.3\n\n# From T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2), we derive a ∝ T_eq^(-2).\n# Therefore, a_y / a_x = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)^2.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of orbital radii a3 / a1\na2_div_a1 = Teq1_div_Teq2**2\na3_div_a2 = Teq2_div_Teq3**2\na3_div_a1 = a2_div_a1 * a3_div_a2\n\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P ∝ a^(3/2).\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2).\nperiod_ratio = a3_div_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(f\"{period_ratio:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>33.4\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.4. This means the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 ($P_3/P_1$). To solve this, we need to find a relationship between orbital period and the given quantities, which are the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Radius**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n- $L$ is the luminosity of the central star.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n- $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star, $L$ is constant. The problem states that the albedo $A$ is the same for all three planets. The terms $16$, $\\pi$, and $\\sigma$ are constants. Therefore, we can establish a simple proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius. We can rearrange this to express the orbital radius in terms of temperature:\n$a \\propto T_{eq}^{-2}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Radii**\n\nWe can use the proportionality from Step 1 to find the ratio of the orbital radii. The ratio of the orbital radii of two planets (e.g., planet 'x' and planet 'y') is:\n$\\frac{a_x}{a_y} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,y}}{T_{eq,x}} \\right)^2$\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n1.  $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n2.  $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\nWe can find the ratio $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$ by chaining the ratios:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\nFirst, let's find the individual radius ratios:\n- $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n- $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\nNow, multiply them to get the total ratio:\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n**Step 3: Relate Orbital Radius to Orbital Period**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nBy taking the square root of both sides, we get the relationship:\n$P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\nNote that the information about the planets' masses is not needed for this calculation, as Kepler's Third Law in this form is a very good approximation when the planets' masses are much smaller than the star's mass.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\nWe substitute the value of the radius ratio we calculated in Step 2:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5} \\approx 33.38$\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
