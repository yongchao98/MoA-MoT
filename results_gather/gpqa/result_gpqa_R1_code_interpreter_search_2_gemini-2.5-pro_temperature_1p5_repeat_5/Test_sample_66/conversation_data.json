    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\nThe system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\nThe state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nIn this representation:\n*   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n*   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n*   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$).\n\nThis means the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $\\mathbf{L}^2 = (\\mathbf{L_1} + \\mathbf{L_2})^2$ with eigenvalue $l(l+1)\\hbar^2 = 2(2+1)\\hbar^2 = 6\\hbar^2$.\nIt is also an eigenstate of the operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n### 2. Understand the Measurement\nWe are performing a measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nThe eigenstates of these individual operators are given in the uncoupled representation as $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$, which can be simplified to $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ since $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are known.\nFor a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m_l$ are -1, 0, and 1. So, both $m_1$ and $m_2$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\n### 3. Determine the Desired Outcome\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n*   $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.\n*   $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.\nTherefore, we are looking for the probability of the system being found in the state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ after the measurement.\n\n### 4. Method 1: Using Conservation of Angular Momentum\nThis is the most direct method.\nThe initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with a precisely known eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\nWhen we measure the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the sum of their outcomes must be equal to the total z-component angular momentum of the initial state.\nLet the measured quantum numbers be $m_{1, \\text{meas}}$ and $m_{2, \\text{meas}}$.\nThe conservation principle implies:\n$m_{1, \\text{meas}} + m_{2, \\text{meas}} = m_{\\text{initial}}$\nIn our case, the desired outcome is $m_{1, \\text{meas}} = -1$ and $m_{2, \\text{meas}} = -1$.\nThe sum would be:\n$-1 + (-1) = -2$.\nThe initial state has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{\\text{initial}} = -1$.\nSince $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n### 5. Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\nThis method involves expressing the initial state in the basis of the states being measured. The probability of measuring a particular state is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient of that state in the expansion.\n\nThe initial state is $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. We need to expand this in the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$:\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\nThe coefficients $\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, often written as $C^{l,m}_{l_1,m_1; l_2,m_2}$.\n\nA fundamental property (selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nWe are looking for the probability of measuring the outcome $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$. This probability is given by:\n$P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nLet's check the selection rule for the coefficient $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle$:\n*   $m = -1$ (from the initial state)\n*   $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$ (from the final state)\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n(For completeness, the actual expansion of the state $|2, -1\\rangle$ is $|2, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle$. This shows that the only possible outcomes of the measurement are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$, each with a probability of $(1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$. The outcome $(-1, -1)$ is not part of the superposition, so its probability is zero.)\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth methods lead to the same result. The probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
