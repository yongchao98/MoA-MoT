    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which can be written as:\n\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the state.\n*   $\\Delta t$ is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s).\n\nThe lifetime of a state ($\\tau$) can be considered as the uncertainty in time, so $\\Delta t = \\tau$. This means the energy of each state is not a perfectly sharp line but is spread out over a range of energies $\\Delta E$. The width of this energy level is given by:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\hbar / \\tau$\n\nFor two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies must be larger than the combined widths of the levels. A common and sufficient condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the width of the *broader* energy level. The broader level is the one with the larger energy uncertainty ($\\Delta E$), which corresponds to the *shorter* lifetime ($\\tau$).\n\nLet's calculate the energy widths for the two states:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s\n    *   Energy width $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s\n    *   Energy width $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\nThe broader energy level is State 1, with an energy width of $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. For the two levels to be resolved, their energy difference, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be greater than this width.\n\n$|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\n*   A) $10^{-9}$ eV is much smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   B) $10^{-11}$ eV is much smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   C) $10^{-8}$ eV is smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   D) $10^{-4}$ eV is much larger than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is significantly larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width (uncertainty) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference must be greater than the\n# energy width of the broader level (which corresponds to the shorter lifetime).\nmin_resolvable_difference = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The broader energy width is {min_resolvable_difference:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(\"The energy difference between the levels must be greater than this value to be resolved.\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-9,\n    \"B\": 1e-11,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\n# Check which option satisfies the condition\nprint(\"\\nChecking options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = \"Yes\" if value > min_resolvable_difference else \"No\"\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV): Resolvable? {is_resolvable}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning and the calculation performed by the Python script are correct.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n1.  The problem uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time ($\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar$).\n2.  The lifetime of a state ($\\tau$) corresponds to the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$), leading to an uncertainty in its energy level, often called the natural linewidth, given by $\\Delta E \\approx \\hbar/\\tau$.\n3.  A state with a shorter lifetime has a larger energy uncertainty (it is \"broader\").\n    *   State 1: $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s $\\implies \\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   State 2: $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s $\\implies \\Delta E_2 \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n4.  To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be larger than their energy widths. A sufficient condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the width of the *broader* level.\n5.  The broader level is State 1, with a width of $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n6.  Therefore, we need to find an energy difference option that is greater than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n*   A) $10^{-9}$ eV is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   B) $10^{-11}$ eV is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   C) $10^{-8}$ eV is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   D) $10^{-4}$ eV is much greater than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option D satisfies the condition for the energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
