    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the initial species.**\n    The solution contains KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate), and Na2HPO4●2H2O, which dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water. We need to find the molarity of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.\n\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n    First, calculate the moles of each substance:\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n\n    Next, calculate the molar concentrations:\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- ([H2PO4-]) = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- ([HPO4^2-]) = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer.**\n    The solution is a buffer system composed of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n    The expression for Ka2 is:\n    Ka2 = ([H⁺][HPO4²⁻]) / [H2PO4⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻).**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The expression for Ka3 is:\n    Ka3 = ([H⁺][PO4³⁻]) / [HPO4²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of orthophosphate, [PO4³⁻]:\n    [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n\n    Now, substitute the values we have calculated. We can assume that the concentration of HPO4²⁻ at this equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is extremely small, meaning very little HPO4²⁻ will dissociate.\n    [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809) / (8.11x10⁻⁸)\n    [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a single calculation step.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# 1. Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# 2. Calculate [H+]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# 3. Calculate [PO4^3-]\npo4_3minus_conc = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{po4_3minus_conc:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has asked to solve a chemistry problem involving a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main goal is to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, in the given solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Components of the Solution:**\n*   Solvent: Water (implied)\n*   Solutes:\n    *   Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄)\n    *   Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O)\n*   Volume of solution: 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n\n**3. Determine the Initial Concentrations of the Relevant Ions:**\nThe salts dissociate completely in water:\n*   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n*   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O\n\nWe need the initial concentrations of the phosphate species, H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate).\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ ([H₂PO₄⁻]):**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ ([HPO₄²⁻]):**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Analyze the Buffer System:**\nThe solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This is a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻  (with equilibrium constant Ka₂)\n\n*   Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸\n\nWe can use the Ka₂ expression to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], in the buffer.\n\nKa₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion (PO₄³⁻) Concentration:**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (with equilibrium constant Ka₃)\n\n*   Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown, [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n\nNow, we substitute the known values. We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the calculated concentration of H⁺. The change in [HPO₄²⁻] due to this equilibrium is negligible because Ka₃ is extremely small.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**6. Compare with Options:**\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n\nOur calculated value matches option C. The python code output `6.24e-07` also confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
