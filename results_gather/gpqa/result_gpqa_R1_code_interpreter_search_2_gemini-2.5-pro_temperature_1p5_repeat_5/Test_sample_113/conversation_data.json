    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), sodium cyanide (NaCN), and reagent A.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must then be protonated to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin.\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   Reagent A must provide the necessary proton (H⁺). Using a strong acid directly with NaCN can be hazardous as it liberates toxic HCN gas. Therefore, the reaction is typically performed by either using a buffered solution or by adding an acid to an aqueous solution of NaCN to generate HCN *in situ*. The hydronium ion, H₃O⁺, represents the aqueous acid source required for this protonation step. NaHSO₃ forms a bisulfite addition product, which is a different reaction. Therefore, A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile).\n    *   **Reagents:** Reagent B and water (H₂O).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base upon heating. The options for reagent B are HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid). Strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are much more effective and commonly used for this transformation than weak acids like acetic acid.\n    *   Therefore, B must be a strong acid, making HCl the suitable choice. This eliminates option C, which suggests the weak acid CH₃COOH.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is H₃O⁺, and reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
