    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. Let's break down the physics behind the equation and evaluate each option.\n\n**The Mott-Gurney Equation and its Derivation**\n\nThe Mott-Gurney law describes the current in a regime known as Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). This regime occurs when a contact can inject more charge carriers into a semiconductor (or insulator) than the material can transport away at low voltages. This excess injected charge forms a \"space charge\" that limits the flow of further current.\n\nThe derivation of the standard Mott-Gurney equation, $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$, relies on several key assumptions:\n\n1.  **Single Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. If both were significant, recombination and interactions between them would need to be considered, leading to a different equation.\n2.  **Trap-Free Solid:** The equation assumes an ideal material with no electronic trap states within the bandgap. If traps exist, they capture some of the injected carriers, reducing the number of free carriers available for conduction and thus altering the J-V relationship. This leads to the \"trap-filled-limit\" SCLC model, which has a different form.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** The model requires that the injecting contact can supply an essentially unlimited number of carriers. This means there is no energy barrier for injection, a condition known as an ideal Ohmic contact. If the contact were non-Ohmic (e.g., a Schottky contact), the current would be limited by the injection process itself (e.g., thermionic emission), not by the space charge in the bulk.\n4.  **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model is derived by considering only the drift of carriers under the influence of the electric field ($J_{drift} = nq\\mu E$). It assumes that the current component arising from the gradient of carrier concentration (diffusion current, $J_{diffusion} = qD \\frac{dn}{dx}$) is negligible in comparison. This is a valid approximation for devices that are not extremely thin and under sufficient applied voltage.\n5.  **Negligible Intrinsic Carrier Concentration:** It's assumed that the density of injected carriers is much larger than the density of thermally generated (intrinsic) carriers.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow, let's assess the given statements based on these assumptions:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because the SCLC is fundamentally a **drift current**. Stating that the drift current is negligible contradicts the entire basis of the model.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The standard Mott-Gurney law is derived for a **single-carrier** device.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This statement correctly identifies all the key assumptions:\n        *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n        *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": Correct, this is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact for this model.\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct.\n    *   This option accurately describes the conditions.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. A **Schottky contact** typically forms an energy barrier to injection. This would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current. SCLC requires an Ohmic contact with no injection barrier.\n\nTherefore, statement C provides the correct set of conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
