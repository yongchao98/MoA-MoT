    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Under neutral or acidic conditions, one bromine atom is added to one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). Since both alpha-carbons in cyclohexanone are equivalent, a single product is formed.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br2\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH) and an available proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α' position, C6). These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The strong base, hydroxide (OH⁻), abstracts the most acidic proton, which is at the α' position (C6), to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻). This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate, **bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one**.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic ketone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, opening the strained cyclopropane ring to form the most stable carbanion. This process results in ring contraction.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (during workup) yields a cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate (which upon workup gives cyclopentanecarboxylic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard reaction to convert a carboxylic acid (or its salt, after protonation) into an acyl chloride.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (from protonation of Product 2)\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LTBA) is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OtBu)3\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This corresponds to the number of unique signals expected in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring bonded to a formyl group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. There is a plane of symmetry that passes through:\n*   The aldehyde proton (H in CHO)\n*   The aldehyde carbon and oxygen (C=O)\n*   The C1 carbon of the cyclopentane ring (the one bonded to the CHO group)\n*   The proton attached to C1\n*   The midpoint of the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nThis plane of symmetry dictates the equivalence of the protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (on -CHO):** It lies on the plane of symmetry and is in a unique chemical environment. This is **one** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The C1 proton (on the ring):** This proton also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is a **second** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the CH2 group at C2 equivalent to the CH2 group at C5. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons are not equivalent. C1 is a chiral center (bonded to four different groups: H, CHO, C2, and C5). Protons on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center are **diastereotopic**. This means the two protons on C2 are distinct from each other, and the two on C5 are distinct from each other. Due to the symmetry plane, one proton on C2 is equivalent to one on C5, and the other proton on C2 is equivalent to the other on C5. This gives **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes the CH2 group at C3 equivalent to the CH2 group at C4. Similar to the case for C2/C5, the chirality at C1 makes the geminal protons at C3 (and C4) diastereotopic. Therefore, the protons on C3/C4 also give rise to **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n\n**Counting the distinct sets of hydrogens:**\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: A pair of diastereotopic protons at C2/C5 (2H)\n*   Set 4: The other pair of diastereotopic protons at C2/C5 (2H)\n*   Set 5: A pair of diastereotopic protons at C3/C4 (2H)\n*   Set 6: The other pair of diastereotopic protons at C3/C4 (2H)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
