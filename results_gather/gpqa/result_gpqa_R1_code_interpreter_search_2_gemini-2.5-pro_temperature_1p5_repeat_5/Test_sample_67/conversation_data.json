    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_initial` in the +Z direction.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment `μ` is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator. The z-component is `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   The problem states the particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means its magnetic moment `μ` is parallel to the field `B`. For `μ` to be in the +Z direction, `μ_z` must be positive. This means `γS_z` is positive. Assuming `γ > 0`, the z-component of spin `S_z` must be positive.\n*   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down). To have positive `S_z`, the particle must be in the spin-up state.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`, which we denote as `|+z>`.\n    *   `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. So, `B_new = B * ŷ`.\n*   The Hamiltonian `H` of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by `H = -μ ⋅ B`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the Hamiltonian is:\n    *   `H = - (γS) ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB(S ⋅ ŷ) = -γBS_y`\n*   This new Hamiltonian will govern the time evolution of the state for `t > 0`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Time Evolution\n\nThe evolution of the state `|ψ(t)>` is described by the Schrödinger equation. An efficient way to find the oscillation frequency is to use the energy eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The new Hamiltonian `H` is proportional to `S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n    *   For `|+y>`: `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   For `|-y>`: `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   The initial state `|+z>` needs to be expressed in this new energy eigenbasis (`|+y>`, `|-y>`). The relationship is:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n*   The state `|ψ(t)>` at a later time `t` is found by applying the time evolution operator `exp(-iHt/ħ)` to the initial state:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n    *   Substituting the energy eigenvalues:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value and Frequency\n\nWe need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`, which is `γ<S_z(t)>`.\n\n*   `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n*   We need to know how `S_z` acts on the `y`-basis states:\n    *   `S_z|+y> = (ħ/2)|-y>`\n    *   `S_z|-y> = (ħ/2)|+y>`\n*   Now, let's calculate `S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n    *   `S_z|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)S_z|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)S_z|-y> ]`\n    *   `S_z|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (ħ/2) * [ exp(iγBt/2)|-y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|+y> ]`\n*   Finally, compute the inner product `<ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`:\n    *   The bra vector is `<ψ(t)| = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iγBt/2)<+y| + exp(iγBt/2)<-y| ]`.\n    *   Due to orthogonality (`<+y|-y>=0`, `<+y|+y>=1`), only two terms survive:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (1/2) * (ħ/2) * [ exp(-iγBt/2)exp(-iγBt/2) + exp(iγBt/2)exp(iγBt/2) ]`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/4) * [ exp(-iγBt) + exp(iγBt) ]`\n*   Using Euler's formula `cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2`, we get:\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/4) * [ 2cos(γBt) ] = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n*   The expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n\nThe result shows that the average value oscillates as `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`. This is known as the **Larmor frequency**.\n\n### A Quicker Method\n\nThe frequency of oscillation of an observable in a two-level system is given by the difference in the energy levels divided by `ħ`.\n1.  The system evolves under the Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y`.\n2.  The energy levels are `E_+ = -γBħ/2` and `E_- = +γBħ/2`.\n3.  The energy difference is `ΔE = E_- - E_+ = (γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n4.  The oscillation frequency `ω` is given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\n5.  `ω = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same oscillation frequency.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are for the oscillation frequency. Our calculation yields an angular frequency of `γB`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
