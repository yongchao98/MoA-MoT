    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The collision and annihilation process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the initial state (before collision):**\n    *   We have an electron (mass `m_e`) moving from left to right (let's define this as the +x direction). Its Lorentz factor is `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   We have a positron (mass `m_p = m_e`) moving from right to left (the -x direction). Its Lorentz factor is `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron (and a positron) is `m_e * c^2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total initial energy (E_i):**\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * m * c^2`.\n    *   Energy of the electron: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 * m_e * c^2`.\n    *   Energy of the positron: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 * m_e * c^2`.\n    *   Total initial energy: `E_i = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c^2 = 6 * m_e * c^2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total initial momentum (p_i):**\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by `p = γ * m * v`. It can also be found from the energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, which gives `p = (sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)) / c = m * c * sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction): `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(4^2 - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)`.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction): `p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(2^2 - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3)`.\n    *   Total initial momentum (a vector, but only has an x-component): `p_i = p_e + p_p = m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))`.\n\n5.  **Define the final state (after annihilation):**\n    *   Two photons are produced. The problem states their energies are equal. Let's call the energy of each photon `E_γ`.\n    *   The total final energy is `E_f = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n    *   One photon moves in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right. Let's assume they move at angles `+θ` and `-θ` with respect to the horizontal (x-axis). This symmetry is required to conserve momentum in the y-direction, as the initial momentum in the y-direction was zero.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n    *   The x-component of the momentum for the first photon is `(p_γ1)_x = (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`.\n    *   The x-component of the momentum for the second photon is `(p_γ2)_x = (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`.\n    *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is `(p_f)_x = (p_γ1)_x + (p_γ2)_x = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation (E_i = E_f):**\n        `6 * m_e * c^2 = 2 * E_γ`\n        `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c^2`\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (p_i = p_f):** We only need to consider the x-component.\n        `m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the angle θ:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `E_γ` from energy conservation into the momentum conservation equation:\n        `m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * ((3 * m_e * c^2) / c) * cos(θ)`\n    *   Simplify the equation:\n        `m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n    *   Divide both sides by `m_e * c`:\n        `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n    *   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n8.  **Calculate the final angle:**\n    *   The angle we found, `θ`, is the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis.\n    *   The total angle *between* the two photons is `2θ`.\n    *   We need to calculate `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Lorentz factors\ngamma_e = 4\ngamma_p = 2\n\n# Calculate cos(theta)\n# cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)\nnumerator = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\ndenominator = gamma_e + gamma_p\ncos_theta = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We have an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the x-axis.\n*   They annihilate, producing two photons.\n*   We are given the Lorentz factors for the initial particles.\n*   We are told the final photons have equal energy and are moving symmetrically away from the x-axis.\n*   The goal is to find the total angle between the two photons.\n\n**2. State the Conservation Laws**\n\nThis process must obey the conservation of relativistic energy and the conservation of relativistic momentum.\n\n**3. Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   **Particle Properties:**\n    *   Electron mass = Positron mass = `m_e`\n    *   Electron Lorentz factor: `γ_e = 4`\n    *   Positron Lorentz factor: `γ_p = 2`\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_i`):**\n    *   The energy of a particle is `E = γ * m * c^2`.\n    *   Energy of the electron: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c^2 = 4 * m_e * c^2`.\n    *   Energy of the positron: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c^2 = 2 * m_e * c^2`.\n    *   Total initial energy is the sum: `E_i = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c^2 = 6 * m_e * c^2`.\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`p_i`):**\n    *   The momentum of a particle is `p = m * c * sqrt(γ^2 - 1)`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (moving in the +x direction): `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(4^2 - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)`.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (moving in the -x direction): `p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(2^2 - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3)`.\n    *   Total initial momentum is the vector sum (only in the x-direction): `p_i = p_e + p_p = m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))`.\n\n**4. Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   Two photons are produced. The problem states their energies are equal. Let the energy of each photon be `E_γ`.\n*   The total final energy is `E_f = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`.\n*   The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n*   The photons move symmetrically: one at an angle `+θ` and the other at `-θ` to the x-axis.\n*   The y-components of their momenta cancel out `(p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0)`, conserving momentum in the y-direction (which was initially zero).\n*   The total final momentum is the sum of the x-components: `p_f = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n*   Substituting `p_γ = E_γ / c`, we get `p_f = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation Laws to Solve for the Angle**\n\n*   **Energy Conservation (`E_i = E_f`):**\n    `6 * m_e * c^2 = 2 * E_γ`\n    This tells us the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c^2`.\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation (`p_i = p_f`):**\n    `m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (E_γ / c) * cos(θ)`\n\n*   **Combine and Solve:**\n    Now substitute the value of `E_γ` from energy conservation into the momentum equation:\n    `m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * ( (3 * m_e * c^2) / c ) * cos(θ)`\n    Simplify by canceling `m_e` and `c` terms:\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * 3 * cos(θ)`\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n    Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n*   **Find the Angle:**\n    The angle we found, `θ`, is the angle of *one* photon relative to the horizontal axis. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    `Angle = 2 * arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 )`\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nLet's use Python to compute the final value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the derived formula: angle = 2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)\n# Let's break it down in terms of the Lorentz factors as a general formula\n# cos(theta) = (m*c*(sqrt(gamma_e^2-1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2-1))) / (2 * E_gamma / c)\n# E_gamma = (gamma_e + gamma_p)*m*c^2 / 2\n# So, cos(theta) = (m*c*(sqrt(gamma_e^2-1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2-1))) / ( (gamma_e + gamma_p)*m*c )\n# cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2-1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2-1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)\n\ngamma_e = 4\ngamma_p = 2\n\nnumerator = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\ndenominator = gamma_e + gamma_p\ncos_theta = numerator / denominator\n\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\nThe output of the code is `138.189...`.
