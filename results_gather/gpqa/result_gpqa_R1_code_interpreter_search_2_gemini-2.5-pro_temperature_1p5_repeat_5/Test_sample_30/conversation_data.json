    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will preferentially add to the positions ortho (2 and 6) or para (4) to the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para-substituted product is typically the major product. Therefore, we assume Product 1 is **4-nitrotoluene** (or p-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an oxidation reaction. While MnO₂ is a mild oxidizing agent, typically used for oxidizing benzylic alcohols, in the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, it is often used to signify the oxidation of a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Stronger reagents like KMnO₄ are more common for this transformation, but we will assume the intended reaction is the oxidation of the methyl group.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group of 4-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. The product is **4-nitrobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (4-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis of Conditions:** NaOH is a strong base. It will deprotonate the carboxylic acid to form sodium 4-nitrobenzoate. The combination of a base (NaOH) and a ketone (acetone) is known to reduce aromatic nitro compounds via a bimolecular reductive coupling mechanism. The acetone acts as the reducing agent (it gets oxidized in the process), and NaOH provides the necessary basic environment.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reductive dimerization of the nitro group. This reaction can lead to two main products: an azoxy compound or an azo compound.\n    *   **Azoxy compound:** Two molecules of 4-nitrobenzoate couple to form 4,4'-azoxydibenzoate. The more stable trans-isomer would have the structure `⁻OOC-C₆H₄-N=N⁺(O⁻)-C₆H₄-COO⁻`.\n    *   **Azo compound:** Further reduction of the azoxy compound (or direct formation) yields the azo compound, 4,4'-azodibenzoate. The more stable trans-isomer has the structure `⁻OOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COO⁻`.\n*   **Identifying Product 3:** In the context of textbook problems, we often assume the reaction proceeds to completion to form the most stable or fully reacted product. The azo compound represents a more complete reduction than the azoxy compound. Furthermore, the azo compound possesses a higher degree of symmetry. Therefore, we identify Product 3 as **trans-4,4'-azodibenzoate**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is trans-4,4'-azodibenzoate. This molecule is analogous to trans-azobenzene or trans-stilbene. It is expected to be planar to maximize conjugation.\n    `Na⁺⁻OOC - [benzene ring] - N=N - [benzene ring] - COO⁻Na⁺`\n    The structure is `trans` about the N=N double bond, and the carboxylate groups are at the para positions.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's identify the symmetry elements for this planar molecule.\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    2.  **Center of Inversion (i):** There is a center of inversion at the midpoint of the N=N double bond. Any point (x,y,z) is inverted through the origin to (-x,-y,-z), and the molecule remains unchanged.\n    3.  **Proper Rotation Axis (C₂):** There is a two-fold rotation axis (C₂) passing through the center of inversion, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    4.  **Plane of Symmetry (σh):** The plane containing the entire molecule is a plane of symmetry. Since this plane is perpendicular to the principal C₂ axis, it is designated as a horizontal plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses the symmetry elements E, C₂, i, and σh belongs to the **C₂h** point group.\n\n*(Alternative Check: The Janovsky reaction, another possibility for Step 3, would lead to an adduct that is chiral, having C₁ symmetry. This is not among the options. The trans-azoxy product would have Cₛ symmetry, which is an option. However, the trans-azo product is more symmetric and represents a more complete reaction, making C₂h the most likely intended answer.)*\n\nThe final product, trans-4,4'-azodibenzoate, has a C₂h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
