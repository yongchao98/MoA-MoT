    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DBE Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation helps determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DBE of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (which accounts for the 5th degree). The additional double bond is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the oxygen atoms in the formula and the IR data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This eliminates any structures with secondary or tertiary amines, or amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring). It is generally too high for an amide and a bit low for a simple phenyl ester, making an aryl ester of the type Ar-COOR the most likely candidate.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is next to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl).\n    *   The doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is next to an electron-donating group (like an amine).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This pair of signals is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The 3H triplet at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) protons, split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   The 2H quartet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) protons, split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks, a quartet).\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. Amine protons are often broad due to chemical exchange and hydrogen bonding.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPlacing the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group in a para arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's review the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide, not an ester. Also, it's 1,3-substituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR aromatic pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester (Ar-O-CO-R). The ethyl group is part of the propionate fragment (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a very characteristic formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR around 8-8.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   Formula C₉H₁₁NO₂: Matches.\n    *   IR: Primary amine (-NH₂) and conjugated ester (Ar-COOR) are present.\n    *   ¹H NMR: Shows a para-substituted ring, an ethyl ester group, and primary amine protons at the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields the adjacent protons (7.0 ppm), and the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group deshields its adjacent protons (8.0 ppm).\n\n<<<D>>>"
