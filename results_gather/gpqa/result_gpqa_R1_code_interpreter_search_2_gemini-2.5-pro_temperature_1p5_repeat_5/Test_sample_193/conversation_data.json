    "This problem requires us to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three interacting spins.\n\n**1. Define the System and States:**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n**2. The Energy Equation:**\nThe energy of the system for a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\nwhere J is a coupling constant.\n\n**3. The Partition Function:**\nThe canonical partition function (Z) is defined as the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i exp(-β*E_i)\nwhere β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\nSince some states may have the same energy (i.e., they are degenerate), we can rewrite the partition function as a sum over unique energy levels (E_j):\nZ = Σ_j g(E_j) * exp(-β*E_j)\nwhere g(E_j) is the degeneracy of the energy level E_j (the number of states with that energy).\n\n**4. Calculate Energy for Each State:**\nWe need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one. Let's calculate the value of the term `S = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` for each state. The energy will then be E = -J*S.\n\n| State # | (S1, S2, S3) | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | S = S1*S2+S1*S3+S2*S3 | Energy E = -J*S |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | (+1, +1, +1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | 3 | -3J |\n| 2 | (+1, +1, -1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| 3 | (+1, -1, +1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| 4 | (-1, +1, +1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | J |\n| 5 | (+1, -1, -1) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | J |\n| 6 | (-1, +1, -1) | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| 7 | (-1, -1, +1) | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 | J |\n| 8 | (-1, -1, -1) | +1 | +1 | +1 | 3 | -3J |\n\n**5. Determine Energy Levels and Degeneracies:**\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1 (E1):** E1 = -3J\n    *   This energy occurs for states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy is g(E1) = 2.\n*   **Energy Level 2 (E2):** E2 = J\n    *   This energy occurs for the other 6 states. These are the states where one spin is different from the other two.\n    *   The degeneracy is g(E2) = 6.\n\n**6. Calculate the Partition Function:**\nNow we can write the partition function using the formula Z = Σ g(E) * exp(-βE):\nZ = g(E1)*exp(-β*E1) + g(E2)*exp(-β*E2)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β*(-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β*(J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nThis can be written as:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**7. Compare with Options:**\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
