    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction called tautomerization. It typically involves the formal migration of a hydrogen atom or proton, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and an adjacent double bond.\n    *   The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must possess an alpha-hydrogen. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 5-6. Let's examine the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyls). The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 1 are C2 and C6. The carbons adjacent to the C=O at position 4 are C3 and C5. All these alpha-carbons are part of a C=C double bond and have no hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are each bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are alpha-hydrogens because they are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups (in fact, they are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate):** Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2, the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  An ester group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since the C-2 atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an alkene. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups (no tetrahedral stereocenters). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=C double bond, making the molecule achiral. An achiral molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   We have determined that A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n        *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n        *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
