    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use this equation.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, an upper state 'b' and a lower state 'a':\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in states 'b' and 'a', respectively.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Applying the Equation to Each Star**\n\nWe can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, using T_1 for star_1 and T_2 for star_2. The energy levels of the iron atom (`ΔE`, `g_b`, `g_a`) are the same in both stars.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1):\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2):\n(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**3. Using the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1.\n\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nNow, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\nThe statistical weight ratio `(g_b / g_a)` is a property of the iron atom and cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n**4. Solving for the Relationship Between Temperatures**\n\nTo solve for T_1 and T_2, we can rearrange the equation.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the exponent rule `e^x / e^y = e^(x-y)`:\n\nexp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n\nexp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln( exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] ) = ln(2)\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parenthesis: `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n**5. Substituting the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`.\nThe Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n\n1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
