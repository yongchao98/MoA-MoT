    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Potential and the System**\n\nThe problem asks for the energy spectrum of a quantum particle of mass 'm' in a two-dimensional potential given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n$V(r, θ) = \\frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kr^2 \\cos^2(θ)$\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is easier to solve for this potential if we switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   $x = r \\cos(θ)$\n*   $y = r \\sin(θ)$\n*   $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k(r \\cos(θ))^2$\n\nSince $x = r \\cos(θ)$, we have:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2$\n\nNow, group the terms with x and y:\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{3}{2} kx^2) + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1+3}{2}) kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\n**3. Recognize the Separable Harmonic Oscillator Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates, $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$, is the sum of two independent one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) potentials:\n*   An oscillator in the x-direction: $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n*   An oscillator in the y-direction: $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} ky^2$\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is $H = H_x + H_y$, where $H_x$ and $H_y$ are the Hamiltonians for the x and y oscillators, respectively. Because the Hamiltonian is separable, the total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y$\n\n**4. Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Oscillator**\n\nThe energy levels of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential $V(z) = \\frac{1}{2} k' z^2$ are given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k'}{m}}$.\n\n*   **For the x-direction oscillator:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (4k) x^2$. So, the effective spring constant is $k_x = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_x}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy levels are $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$.\n\n*   **For the y-direction oscillator:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$. The effective spring constant is $k_y = k$.\n    The angular frequency is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_y}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n    The energy levels are $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of $E_{n_x}$ and $E_{n_y}$:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nTo simplify, let's factor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = \\left[ (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\cdot 2 + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nHere, $n_x$ and $n_y$ are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and they can be any non-negative integer ($n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)$. This matches option D.\n\nA) $E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))$\nB) $E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))$\nC) $E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))$\nD) $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n<<<D>>>"
