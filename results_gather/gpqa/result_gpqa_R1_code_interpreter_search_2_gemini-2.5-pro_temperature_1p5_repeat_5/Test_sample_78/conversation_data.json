    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Product from NMR Data**\n    The problem provides the 1H and 13C NMR spectra for the product of a reaction involving compound X (C11H12O). We must first deduce the structure of this product.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   The molecular formula of the reactant is C11H12O. The total proton count from the 1H NMR is 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12H, which matches the reactant's formula. This suggests the reaction is an isomerization or rearrangement, as no atoms are lost or gained.\n        *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3H in the aromatic methyl region, likely a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. Combined with the para-disubstitution pattern, this points to a p-tolyl group (4-methylphenyl group).\n        *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** Another singlet integrating to 3H. Given the 13C data below, this is likely a methyl ketone (acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3).\n        *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d):** Two doublets, each integrating to 1H, in the vinylic region (alkene protons). They are coupled to each other, indicating a -CH=CH- moiety. The large chemical shift difference suggests conjugation with an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n    *   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a ketone.\n        *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s):** A typical chemical shift for an aromatic methyl carbon (the methyl of the p-tolyl group).\n        *   **δ 28.4 (1C, s):** A chemical shift characteristic of a methyl carbon attached to a carbonyl group (the methyl of the acetyl group).\n        *   **δ 126.9 (2C, s) to 144.1 (1C, s):** These six signals account for the remaining 8 carbons (2C + 1C + 2C + 1C + 1C + 1C = 8C). These are the six carbons of the benzene ring and the two carbons of the C=C double bond.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        Putting all the pieces together:\n        1.  A p-tolyl group: `CH3-C6H4-`\n        2.  A methyl ketone group: `-C(=O)CH3`\n        3.  A trans C=C double bond: `-CH=CH-`\n        The only way to connect these fragments to match the conjugation implied by the chemical shifts is to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone: `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`. This is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. This structure is fully consistent with all NMR data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Reactant X**\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) in a nonpolar solvent at 130 °C. DABCO is a non-nucleophilic base. These conditions (base, heat) are known to promote rearrangement reactions, particularly for epoxides.\n    *   **Task:** Identify which of the given options (all are epoxides with the formula C11H12O) would rearrange to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the Options**\n\n    *   We are looking for an epoxide isomer of the product that contains a p-tolyl group and can rearrange to a methyl ketone. The rearrangement from a vinyl-substituted epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone is a known base-catalyzed reaction. The most likely mechanism involves the base removing a proton from the terminal `CH2` of the epoxide ring, followed by an E2-like ring-opening to form an enolate, which then tautomerizes to the methyl ketone.\n        `R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2  --[Base]--> R-CH=CH-C(=O)CH3`\n\n    *   Let's check the options based on this:\n        *   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH3)`. This has a phenyl group (`C6H5-`), not a p-tolyl group. Also, its rearrangement would likely yield an ethyl ketone, not a methyl ketone. So, it is incorrect.\n        *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-`. The structure is `(p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This molecule has the correct p-tolyl group and the terminal epoxide (`-CH(O)CH2`) necessary to rearrange into the required methyl ketone product, 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `C6H5-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`. This has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group, and a different alkene skeleton. Incorrect.\n        *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This typically refers to `C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. The molecular formula is C10H10O, which is not the formula of compound X (C11H12O). Incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The product of the reaction is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only reactant from the options that has the correct molecular formula and can rearrange under the given conditions to form this specific product is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
