    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Initial State and Dilution**\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Molarity = Moles / Volume (in L)\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL = 0.0200 L\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol/L * 0.0200 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration after dilution:**\n    *   The acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same (0.00100 mol).\n    *   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid = Moles / New Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M. This is the solution being titrated.\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Understand 25% Titration:** This point in the titration is when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This means the solution contains 75% unreacted acetic acid and 25% acetate. We have a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** This equation is ideal for calculating the pH of a buffer solution.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n4.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75 or 1:3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio is the same.\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + (-0.48)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.25\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Understand the Equivalence Point:** This is the point where all the initial acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa), in water.\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 mL\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total volume = Initial diluted volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L\n    *   Moles of acetate (CH3COO⁻) formed = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the weak base solution:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n    *   Reaction: CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Find the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    *   Use the approximation: [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH3COO⁻])\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * (0.02) ) = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Conclusion**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThis corresponds to option C. To verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial conditions\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid = 0.0200  # L (20.00 cm3)\nV_water = 0.0200 # L (20.00 cm3)\nC_NaOH = 0.1     # M\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculations for pH at 25% titration ---\n# The ratio of conjugate base to acid is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Calculations for pH at equivalence point ---\n# 1.

    "The analysis and calculations are as follows:\n\n**1. Understand the initial state after dilution:**\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) = Volume × Molarity = 0.0200 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.\n*   The solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the new total volume 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (or 0.0400 L).\n*   The concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is M_diluted = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration:**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid. This forms a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, pH ≈ **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point:**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution contains only the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (or 0.0500 L).\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   **pH of the weak base solution:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √( (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
