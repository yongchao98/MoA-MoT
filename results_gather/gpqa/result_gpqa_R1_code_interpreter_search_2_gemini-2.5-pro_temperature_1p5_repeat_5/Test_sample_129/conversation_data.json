    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the cosmological redshift, which stretches the wavelength of light from distant objects as it travels to us through the expanding universe. The relationship between the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$) and the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{observed}$) is given by the formula:\n    $\\lambda_{observed} = \\lambda_{emitted} \\times (1 + z)$\n    where 'z' is the redshift.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given and Required Values:**\n    *   **Emitted Wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$):** The problem states this is the Lyman-alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Detection Method:** The detection is to be done with \"optical ground-based telescopes\". This is the critical constraint. Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, primarily due to the ozone layer. This creates an \"optical window\" for ground-based astronomy.\n    *   **Required Value:** We need to find the *lower limit on the redshift* (minimum 'z') that would allow this 1216 Å line to be detected from the ground.\n\n3.  **Determine the Observational Limit:** For a spectral line to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope, its redshifted wavelength must fall within the optical window of the atmosphere. The atmosphere begins to be transparent at the blue/violet end of the visible spectrum. While there is no single sharp cutoff, for practical purposes, significant atmospheric absorption makes observations very difficult below about 3800-4000 Å (380-400 nm). We need to find the redshift 'z' that shifts the 1216 Å line to at least this minimum observable wavelength. Let's use a conservative but realistic value for this cutoff, for instance, 4000 Å.\n\n4.  **Set up the Calculation:** We want to find the minimum redshift, $z_{min}$. This occurs when the observed wavelength is equal to the minimum wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere, let's call it $\\lambda_{cutoff}$.\n    So, $\\lambda_{cutoff} = \\lambda_{emitted} \\times (1 + z_{min})$\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for $z_{min}$:\n    $1 + z_{min} = \\frac{\\lambda_{cutoff}}{\\lambda_{emitted}}$\n    $z_{min} = \\frac{\\lambda_{cutoff}}{\\lambda_{emitted}} - 1$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Let's perform the calculation using python to be precise. We'll use a practical cutoff wavelength that allows for good detection, say between 3900 Å and 4100 Å, as the options provided are quite distinct.\n\n```python\n# The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_emitted = 1216\n\n# The approximate cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes due to atmospheric absorption.\n# Let's calculate the redshift corresponding to the given options to see which cutoff they imply.\n\n# Option A: z = 2.4\nlambda_obs_A = lambda_emitted * (1 + 2.4)\nprint(f\"For z = 2.4, the observed wavelength is {lambda_obs_A:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n\n# Option B: z = 1.9\nlambda_obs_B = lambda_emitted * (1 + 1.9)\nprint(f\"For z = 1.9, the observed wavelength is {lambda_obs_B:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n\n# Option C: z = 1.2\nlambda_obs_C = lambda_emitted * (1 + 1.2)\nprint(f\"For z = 1.2, the observed wavelength is {lambda_obs_C:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n\n# Now, let's calculate the required redshift for a typical practical cutoff, say 4000 Angstroms.\nlambda_cutoff = 4000\nz_min_practical = (lambda_cutoff / lambda_emitted) - 1\nprint(f\"\\nRequired redshift to shift the line to {lambda_cutoff} Angstroms is z = {z_min_practical:.2f}.\")\n\n```\nFrom the calculation:\n*   A redshift of **z = 1.9** shifts the line to **3526.4 Å**. This wavelength is at the very edge of the atmospheric window and is subject to very strong absorption, making detection extremely difficult.\n*   A redshift of **z = 2.4** shifts the line to **4134.4 Å**. This is well into the violet/blue part of the visible spectrum, where the atmosphere is much more transparent and detection is feasible.\n*   A redshift of **z = 1.2** shifts the line to **2675.2 Å**, which is deep in the UV and completely blocked by the atmosphere.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the *lower limit* for *detection*. While a redshift of ~1.9 is the theoretical minimum for any photons to get through, it is not a practical limit for reliable detection. A redshift of z=2.4 moves the line to a wavelength (~4134 Å) that is readily observable. Among the given choices, 2.4 represents the most reasonable lower limit for practical astronomical observations of these features.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum redshift (z) required for the Lyman-alpha (Ly-$\\alpha$) spectral line, which is at a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å), to be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the key constraint:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from space. The \"optical window,\" where the atmosphere is transparent, begins at the blue/violet end of the visible spectrum, at a wavelength of approximately 3900-4000 Å. Therefore, for the Ly-$\\alpha$ line to be detected from the ground, it must be redshifted from its original UV wavelength (1216 Å) to at least ~4000 Å.\n\n2.  **Use the redshift formula:** The relationship between the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emitted}$), the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{observed}$), and redshift (z) is given by:\n    $\\lambda_{observed} = \\lambda_{emitted} \\times (1 + z)$\n\n3.  **Solve for the minimum redshift:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for z:\n    $z = (\\lambda_{observed} / \\lambda_{emitted}) - 1$\n\n    We set the required observed wavelength to the minimum for ground-based detection and the emitted wavelength to that of Ly-$\\alpha$:\n    *   $\\lambda_{observed-min} \\approx 4000$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{emitted} = 1216$ Å\n\n    Now, we can calculate the minimum redshift:\n    $z_{min} = (4000 / 1216) - 1$\n    $z_{min} \\approx 3.29 - 1$\n    $z_{min} \\approx 2.29$\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:** The calculated minimum redshift for detection is approximately 2.29. We need to find the option that represents a realistic lower limit for detection.\n\n    *   A) z = 2.4: This redshift would shift the Ly-$\\alpha$ line to $1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4$ Å. This wavelength is well within the observable optical window.\n    *   B) z = 1.9: This would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4$ Å. This is still in the near-UV and would be very strongly absorbed by the atmosphere, making detection with a typical ground-based optical telescope extremely difficult or impossible.\n    *   C) z = 1.2: This would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2$ Å. This is deep in the UV and is completely blocked.\n    *   D) z = 3: This redshift would shift the line to $1216 \\times (1 + 3) = 4864$ Å. This is easily observable, but the question asks for the *lower limit*.\n\nSince a redshift of at least ~2.29 is required, the lowest value from the options that makes the object detectable is 2.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
