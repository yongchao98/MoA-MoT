    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the context of particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The number of particles, N, remaining after a time, t, from an initial sample, N₀, is described by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n    where T is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where the time t is measured.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, time runs slower for a moving object as observed from a stationary frame. The mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is τ. When the particle moves at a relativistic speed with a Lorentz factor γ, its observed lifetime (T) in the lab frame is dilated:\n    T = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Applying to the Problem:**\n    *   The time of flight for a particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is t_lab = R / v, where R is the radius of the detector and v is the particle's velocity.\n    *   Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is very close to the speed of light, c. So, we can approximate t_lab ≈ R / c.\n    *   Substituting the dilated lifetime into the decay equation, the fraction of particles (f = N/N₀) that survive the journey to the detector wall is:\n        f = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ)) = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))\n\n4.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** One-third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall with a Lorentz factor (γ₁) of 20.\n        1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ))\n    *   **Scenario 2:** Two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the wall with an unknown Lorentz factor (γ₂).\n        2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ))\n\n5.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We have a system of two equations. The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant for this type of particle and detector setup. Let's solve for this constant part first.\n    From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)\n    -ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)\n    ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)  \n    Multiplying by 20, we get:\n    20 * ln(3) = (R/c) / τ\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)\n    ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) = (R/c) / τ\n\n    We can now substitute the expression for `(R/c) / τ` that we found from Scenario 1:\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Finally, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\n6.  **Calculation:** We can compute the numerical value for γ₂.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factor for the first scenario\ngamma_1 = 20\n\n# Calculate the natural logarithms\nln_3 = math.log(3)\nln_3_div_2 = math.log(3/2)\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor (gamma_2)\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln_3 / ln_3_div_2\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n>54.18957448356973\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 40\n    B) 54\n    C) 28\n    D) 68\n\n    The closest option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay and Time Dilation**:\n    The number of particles, N(t), that survive after a time t is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/T)\n    Here, N₀ is the initial number of particles, and T is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame.\n\n    According to the theory of special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer from a stationary observer's perspective. This is known as time dilation. The lifetime T in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper lifetime τ (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, γ:\n    T = γ * τ\n\n2.  **Relating Survival Fraction to Lorentz Factor**:\n    The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance R) is t = R/v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is approximately the speed of light, c. So, t ≈ R/c.\n\n    Substituting these into the decay equation, the fraction of particles (f = N/N₀) that reach the detector is:\n    f = e^(-t/T) = e^-( (R/c) / (γτ) )\n\n3.  **Setting Up Equations for Both Scenarios**:\n    Let the constant part of the exponent be K = (R/cτ). The formula becomes f = e^(-K/γ).\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: 1/3 of the particles survive with γ₁ = 20.\n        1/3 = e^(-K/20)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: 2/3 of the particles survive with an unknown Lorentz factor γ₂.\n        2/3 = e^(-K/γ₂)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**:\n    First, we solve for the constant K using the information from Scenario 1. We take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K/20\n    -ln(3) = -K/20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, we use this value of K in the equation for Scenario 2. Again, we take the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -K/γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -K/γ₂\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) = K\n\n    Substitute the expression for K we found earlier:\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Finally, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    Using the values ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055:\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\n    The calculation confirms that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 68\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
