    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a quantum system in a specific state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Uncertainty:** In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty of an operator A is defined by the standard deviation of its measurements. The formula for the uncertainty is:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    In our case, A is the operator $P_z$, so we need to calculate:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The problem also provides information about operators $P_x$ and $P_y$, and states that $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$. While this information is good for context and consistency checking, it is not directly needed for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$ since both $|\\psi\\rangle$ and $P_z$ are explicitly given.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculations:** The calculation is a two-step process: first, find the expectation values $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$, and then use them to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n    *   **Step 4a: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n        The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n        First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since the components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, it's simply the transpose:\n        $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n        Next, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (-\\hbar) \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n        Now, we compute the inner product of $\\langle \\psi |$ with the resulting vector $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n\n    *   **Step 4b: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n        The expectation value is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n        First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\times P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n        Next, calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n        Now, compute the inner product:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n    *   **Step 4c: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n        Now we plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n5.  **Alternative Calculation Method (using eigenvalues):**\n    The basis vectors are given as the eigenvectors of $P_z$. Since $P_z$ is diagonal, the basis vectors are $|v_1\\rangle=(1,0,0)^T$, $|v_2\\rangle=(0,1,0)^T$, and $|v_3\\rangle=(0,0,1)^T$, with corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda_1=\\hbar$, $\\lambda_2=0$, and $\\lambda_3=-\\hbar$.\n    The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be written as a superposition in this basis:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = c_1|v_1\\rangle + c_2|v_2\\rangle + c_3|v_3\\rangle = (-1/2)|v_1\\rangle + (1/\\sqrt{2})|v_2\\rangle + (-1/2)|v_3\\rangle$\n    The expectation value of a function $f(P_z)$ is $\\langle f(P_z) \\rangle = \\sum_i |c_i|^2 f(\\lambda_i)$.\n    *   $\\langle P_z \\rangle = |c_1|^2 \\lambda_1 + |c_2|^2 \\lambda_2 + |c_3|^2 \\lambda_3 = (-1/2)^2(\\hbar) + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2(0) + (-1/2)^2(-\\hbar) = \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar + 0 - \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar = 0$.\n    *   $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = |c_1|^2 \\lambda_1^2 + |c_2|^2 \\lambda_2^2 + |c_3|^2 \\lambda_3^2 = (-1/2)^2(\\hbar^2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2(0^2) + (-1/2)^2((-\\hbar)^2) = \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2 + 0 + \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n    *   $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    Both methods yield the same result.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The calculated uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.
