    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has one alpha-carbon with three protons. The reaction brominates this position.\n    *   **Product 1:** BrCH₂COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH₃CH₂OH) in the presence of an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) to form an ester.\n    *   BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH → BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   This is a sequential alkylation process.\n    *   **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic alpha-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH₂ group are acidic because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) groups.\n        NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n        [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + Br⁻\n    *   **Second Deprotonation:** Since NaH is in excess, it removes the remaining acidic alpha-proton.\n        NCCH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    *   **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 4, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C1\n           /  \\\n      H₂C(2)--C(6)H₂\n      |      |\n      H₂C(3)--C(5)H₂\n           \\  /\n            C(4)H₂\n```\n\nTo count the signals, we must assess the chemical equivalence of the protons based on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Carbon 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt), a C2 carbon of the ring, and a C6 carbon of the ring. Therefore, **C1 is a chiral center**. The presence of this chiral center and the two different substituents (-CN and -COOEt) means the molecule has **no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation**.\n\n*   **Proton Equivalence:** In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that cannot be interconverted by bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct proton environments:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **-CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH₂-:** This methylene group is adjacent to the ester oxygen, which is attached to the chiral center C1. Protons on a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. A rigorous analysis would count them as two separate signals. However, in many contexts (especially multiple-choice questions where the rigorous count is not an option), these are often simplified and treated as a single signal. Let's explore both possibilities.\n        *   *Rigorous count:* **2 signals** for the diastereotopic CH₂ protons.\n        *   *Simplified count:* **1 signal** for the CH₂ protons.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring contains 5 methylene (CH₂) groups, for a total of 10 protons.\n    *   Since the molecule is chiral and has no symmetry, the two sides of the ring are different. This means C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Furthermore, within each CH₂ group, the two geminal protons (which can be described as axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct.\n        *   Protons on C2 (2H): **2 signals**\n        *   Protons on C3 (2H): **2 signals**\n        *   Protons on C4 (2H): **2 signals**\n        *   Protons on C5 (2H): **2 signals**\n        *   Protons on C6 (2H): **2 signals**\n    *   This gives a total of **10 signals** for the ring protons.\n\n### Total Signal Count\n\nLet's sum the signals based on the two interpretations for the ethyl group:\n\n*   **Rigorous Count:** 1 (CH₃) + 2 (diastereotopic CH₂) + 10 (ring) = **13 signals**. This is not among the options (A, B, C, D).\n\n*   **Count with Simplification:** In many problems of this type, a common simplification is to treat diastereotopic protons on a flexible ethyl chain as equivalent for counting purposes, even though they are strictly non-equivalent. Applying this simplification:\n    *   1 (CH₃) + 1 (simplified CH₂) + 10 (ring) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis matches option B. This interpretation assumes that the question intends for this common simplification to be made, given that the strictly correct answer of 13 is not available. The other options would require further, less justifiable simplifications, such as imposing a false symmetry on the ring itself. Therefore, 12 is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
