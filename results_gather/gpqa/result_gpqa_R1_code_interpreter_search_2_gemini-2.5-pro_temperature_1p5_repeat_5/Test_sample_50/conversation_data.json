    "This problem can be solved using the method of image charges. This method allows us to replace a complex system involving induced charges on a conductor with a simpler system of point charges that produces the identical electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\n**1. The Setup**\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   \"Grounded\" means the potential of the sphere is held constant at V = 0.\n*   The charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\n\nThe electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`. To satisfy the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero (V=0), the image charge `q'` must be placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are well-established:\n*   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Position of image charge (b):** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center of the sphere)\n\nThe negative sign of `q'` indicates that the net induced charge on the sphere is opposite in sign to `q`, which makes sense as the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nA common way to calculate the energy of interaction between a charge and an induced charge distribution is to use the formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` that is created by *all other charges* in the system. In this case, \"all other charges\" refers to the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\nSo, we can calculate `V_induced` at the position of `q`:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n`V_induced = - k * (R/d) * q / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n`V_induced = - k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the total potential energy `U` using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system, which is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the grounded sphere. The energy is negative, indicating an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U = - k*q^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) * k*q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)\nC) U = - (1/2) k*q^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)\nD) U = - (1/2) k*q^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)\n\nOur derived expression matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
