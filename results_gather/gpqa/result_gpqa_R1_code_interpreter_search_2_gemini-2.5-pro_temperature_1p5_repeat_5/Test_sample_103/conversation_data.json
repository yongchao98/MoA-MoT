    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The change in wavelength (Δλ) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the radial velocity (v_star) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    Δλ / λ = v_star / c\n    Where λ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *maximum* periodic wavelength shifts, which correspond to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star also moves in a circular orbit around the common center of mass (barycenter). The velocity amplitude K of the star is given by:\n    K = (2π * a_s) / T\n    where a_s is the radius of the star's orbit around the barycenter and T is the orbital period (which is the same for the star and the planet).\n\n    The position of the barycenter is defined by M_star * a_s = M_p * a_p, where M_star and M_p are the masses of the star and planet, and a_p is the radius of the planet's orbit. The total separation is a = a_s + a_p.\n    From this, we can express a_s as:\n    a_s = a * (M_p / (M_star + M_p))\n\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (Neptune vs. the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.\n    So, a_s ≈ a * (M_p / M_star).\n\n    Substituting this into the equation for K:\n    K ≈ (2π / T) * [a * (M_p / M_star)]\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit and M_p << M_star:\n    T² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_star)) * a³\n    Where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We need to express 'a' in terms of T to substitute it into our equation for K.\n    a³ ≈ (G * M_star * T²) / (4π²)\n    a ≈ [ (G * M_star * T²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)\n    This shows that `a` is proportional to `M_star^(1/3) * T^(2/3)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations to Find the Relationship between K and T:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for 'a' into the equation for K:\n    K ∝ (a/T) * (M_p / M_star)\n    K ∝ [ M_star^(1/3) * T^(2/3) / T ] * (M_p / M_star)\n    K ∝ M_star^(1/3) * T^(-1/3) * M_p * M_star^(-1)\n    K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * T^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    We want to find the ratio T₂ / T₁. Let's set up the ratio for K₂ / K₁ using the proportionality we just derived:\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ M_p2 * M_star2^(-2/3) * T₂^(-1/3) ] / [ M_p1 * M_star1^(-2/3) * T₁^(-1/3) ]\n\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (we assume M_p1 = M_p2). Therefore, the mass terms cancel out:\n    K₂ / K₁ = T₂^(-1/3) / T₁^(-1/3)\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Solve for T₂ / T₁:**\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n    1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for T₂ / T₁, first cube both sides:\n    (1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n    2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\n    Now, take the reciprocal to find the desired ratio:\n    T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\nTo confirm with a script:\n```python\n# The ratio of the velocity amplitudes K2/K1 is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nratio_K = 7 / 5\n\n# We derived the relationship K is proportional to T^(-1/3).\n# K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3)\n# T2/T1 = (K2/K1)^(-3)\nratio_T = ratio_K**(-3)\n\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n\nThe computed value confirms our manual calculation.\n\nFinal Answer is ~0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n<<<A>>>",
    "The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity and Wavelength Shift:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) due to the Doppler effect is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_star). The maximum shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Stellar Velocity and Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star), the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\n    *   K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2πa / T), where 'a' is the orbital radius and 'T' is the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period and radius:\n    *   T² ∝ a³ / M_star\n    *   Rearranging for 'a', we get a ∝ (T² * M_star)^(1/3) = T^(2/3) * M_star^(1/3).\n\n4.  **Combining the Relationships:** Substitute the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the equation for K:\n    *   K ∝ (M_p / M_star) * (1/T) * [T^(2/3) * M_star^(1/3)]\n    *   K ∝ M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * T^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We want to find T₂ / T₁. Let's set up a ratio using the proportionality above:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = [M_p2 * M_star2^(-2/3) * T₂^(-1/3)] / [M_p1 * M_star1^(-2/3) * T₁^(-1/3)]\n\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses (M_p1 ≈ M_p2). The mass terms cancel out:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = T₂^(-1/3) / T₁^(-1/3) = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)\n\n6.  **Solving for T₂ / T₁:**\n    *   We know K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n    *   1.4 = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3)\n    *   To solve for T₂ / T₁, raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = (1.4)^(-3) = 1 / (1.4)³ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
