    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (or chiral center), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, the presence of stereocenters does not guarantee chirality, as molecules with internal symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) are achiral. These are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule contains a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, Cl, H, C2, C(methyl), C(ethyl)) lie roughly in the same plane.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents) in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the answer. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, specific stereoisomer. The `R` and `S` designators indicate the absolute configuration at chiral centers.\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific enantiomer (using R/S descriptors for its chiral centers), it is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Chiral compounds are **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, meaning the substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon).\n    *   When the two chiral centers have opposite configurations (R and S), there is a center of symmetry in the molecule's staggered conformation. This makes the molecule superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above.\n    *   The stereoisomer where both chiral centers have the same configuration ((R,R) or (S,S)) lacks any internal plane or center of symmetry.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer and its mirror image, the (2S,2S) isomer, are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As a single enantiomer, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the ring path `-CH2-CH=`, and 4) the ring path `-CH2-CH2-`. Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the relative stereochemistry of the three hydroxyl groups. In modern IUPAC nomenclature for such symmetric systems, 's' and 'r' are used for pseudoasymmetric centers.\n    *   The `(s,s,s)` designation corresponds to the all-`cis` isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   This highly symmetric molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH bond and the opposing C-H bond).\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure can be deduced as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other potential chiral centers in the isobutyl chain or the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through the carbonyl group and bisect the isobutyl and cyclopentyl groups.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- Compound 2: Active\n- Compound 4: Active\n- Compound 5: Active\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
