    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The bicyclic system has 7 atoms in the skeleton. The bridgehead carbons (let's call them C1 and C6) are connected by a 4-carbon chain (C2-C3-C4-C5), a 1-carbon chain (C6-C1 itself is 1 bond, not a chain), and a 0-atom chain. The `.0` indicates the bridgehead carbons are adjacent. The `7-oxa` means atom 7, the single-atom bridge, is an oxygen. This confirms the structure is a cyclohexene oxide.\n    *   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The active nucleophile is the methyl anion, CH₃⁻ (or its equivalent).\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regiochemistry of the Attack\nTwo key principles govern the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n1.  The reaction proceeds via an S_N2-like mechanism.\n2.  The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n\nLet's identify the carbons of the epoxide ring, which are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, two other ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a methyl group. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen and two other ring carbons (C1 and C5). It is a **secondary** carbon.\n\nThe less hindered carbon is C6. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\nThe attack on C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (implied in such reactions) protonates the resulting alkoxide ion to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n*   **Resulting Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol. The -OH group is on C1. The original methyl group is also on C1. A new methyl group is on C6. The methyl groups at C3 and C4 are unaffected.\n\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product Skeleton:** The principal functional group is the hydroxyl group, so the carbon it is attached to (the original C1) is designated as C1 in the product's name. To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring from C1 towards the adjacent carbon with the new methyl group (the original C6).\n    *   New C1 = Old C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Old C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Old C5\n    *   New C4 = Old C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Old C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Old C2\nThe methyl substituents are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This regiochemistry rules out options B and D, which describe a 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexanol, a product that would arise from an attack on C1.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThe S_N2 attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon center being attacked. The configurations of the other chiral centers remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Chiral center at C1:** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is **retained**. The starting configuration is (1R), so the product configuration at this carbon is also **R**.\n\n*   **Chiral center at C6:** This center is attacked by the nucleophile. Its configuration is **inverted**. The starting configuration is (6S), so the product configuration at this carbon (which is C2 in the new naming system) will be **R**.\n\n*   **Chiral center at C3:** This center is not involved in the reaction. Its configuration is **retained**. The starting configuration is (3R). In the product, this carbon is C5. Its configuration is **R**.\n\n*   **Chiral center at C4:** This center is also not involved in the reaction. Its configuration is **retained**. The starting configuration is (4R), and it remains C4 in the product name. Its configuration is **R**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Product Name\nCombining the results from the regiochemistry and stereochemistry analysis:\n\n*   Product name: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   Configuration at C1 (from old C1): **1R**\n*   Configuration at C2 (from old C6): **2R** (due to inversion S -> R)\n*   Configuration at C4 (from old C4): **4R**\n*   Configuration at C5 (from old C3): **5R**\n\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n*   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product name and stereochemistry perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
