    "The user wants me to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term `<H>` with a specific transition energy `ΔE` in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Calculation\n\n**a) Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term `<H>`**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, which describes the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field, is given by the Zeeman effect Hamiltonian. The energy of this interaction is:\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B \\cdot m \\cdot B $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.\n*   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n*   $B$ is the magnitude of the external magnetic field.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   $B = 1 \\, \\text{T}$\n*   $m$ is a \"small value\". For a non-zero interaction, let's take the smallest integer value, $m=1$.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is a physical constant:\n*   $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}$ (Joules per Tesla)\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$:\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) $$\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} $$\nTo make the comparison easier, let's convert this energy to electronvolts (eV), using the conversion factor $1 \\, \\text{eV} \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$.\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle_{\\text{eV}} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\n**b) Calculate the transition energy `ΔE`**\n\nThe transition energy `ΔE` can be calculated from the given wavelength $\\lambda$ using the formula:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant $\\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n*   $c$ is the speed of light $\\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nLet's calculate `ΔE`:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $$\nNow, let's convert this to electronvolts (eV):\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{eV}} = \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n*Note: This wavelength, 486.1 nm, corresponds to the Balmer beta line ($n=4 \\to n=2$) in the Hydrogen spectrum.*\n\n**c) Compare the orders of magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n$$ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\n### 2. Final Answer\nThe comparison shows that the energy from the paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the energy of the specified atomic transition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
