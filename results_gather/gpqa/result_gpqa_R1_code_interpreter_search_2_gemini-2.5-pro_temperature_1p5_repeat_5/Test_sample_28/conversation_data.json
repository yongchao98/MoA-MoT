    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This is best achieved by inactivating the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that causes a complete loss of function, such as a nonsense mutation or a frameshift mutation.\n\n*   **Understanding the Gene Sequence:**\n    *   The provided intact gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for protein synthesis, coding for Methionine (Met).\n    *   The sequence ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is a stop codon, signaling the end of protein synthesis.\n    *   The mutations are located in the first exon, near the beginning of the gene. Mutations early in the coding sequence have a higher probability of disrupting the entire protein's function.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Mutations by Translating the DNA Sequence:** We will translate the DNA sequence of the intact gene and each mutant into its corresponding amino acid sequence. We read the DNA sequence in groups of three (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Translation: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...`\n        This is the normal, functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...` (Assuming the most plausible interpretation of the provided string)\n        *   Codons: `ATG` `TTC` `TAC` `GCT` ...\n        *   Comparison to Intact: The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (both code for Phe, a silent mutation). The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   Mutation Type: This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine).\n        *   Effect: This might alter or destroy the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed. The protein is still fully translated, just with one different amino acid. This is less likely to cause a complete knockout compared to more severe mutations.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...` (Assuming the most plausible interpretation of the provided string)\n        *   Codons: `ATG` `TTC` `TAA` `GCT` ...\n        *   Comparison to Intact: The third codon `CTC` (Leu) becomes `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid (Phe). The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This mutation is highly probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n        *   Comparison to Intact: This mutation appears more complex. If we assume the simplest severe mutation, it's a single nucleotide insertion (e.g., a 'T' after the second codon `TTT`).\n        *   `ATG TTT T CTC GCT GGT...` -> `ATG TTT TCT CGC TGG T...`\n        *   Mutation Type: This is a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame is altered from the point of insertion.\n        *   Effect: All amino acids coded after the mutation will be incorrect, and a stop codon is likely to be encountered shortly after. This would also almost certainly produce a non-functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n        *   Comparison to Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` -> `ATG TTT TAC GCT -- ACT...`\n        *   Mutation Type: This appears to be a complex mutation involving both a missense (`CTC`->`TAC`) and a deletion of a full codon (`GGT`). This is an **in-frame deletion**.\n        *   Effect: The reading frame is maintained, but one amino acid (Gly) is missing from the final protein. While this could disable the protein, it is generally less disruptive than a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound.\n    *   Missense (Mutant 1) and in-frame deletion (Mutant 4) might not fully inactivate the protein.\n    *   Both a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are very likely to create a non-functional protein (a \"knockout\").\n    *   However, Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the 3rd position, which is an unequivocal and definitive stop to protein synthesis. It is the clearest and most certain method among the choices to prevent the formation of a functional protein.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
