    "This problem requires us to calculate the molar fraction of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing various cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The fraction of each complex depends on the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]` and the overall stability constants (β).\n\n1.  **Identify the species:**\n    The species in solution are the free Co(II) ion (`Co^2+`) and the complexes formed with thiocyanate (`SCN-`):\n    *   `Co^2+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (the species of interest)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Define the formation equilibria and stability constants:**\n    The formation of these complexes from the free metal ion and ligand is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n    *   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n    *   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n3.  **Express the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n4.  **Formulate the distribution coefficient (α):**\n    The fraction (α_n) of a particular complex `[Co(SCN)n]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. We are interested in `α2` for `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n    `α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By rearranging the stability constant equations, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n    Substituting these into the equation for `c(Co)` gives:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Now we can write the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n    The total concentration of the ligand `SCN-` (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion `Co(II)` (0.01 M). This means that the ligand is in large excess, and the amount that gets bound to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` as its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n6.  **Calculate the percentage:**\n    We will now substitute the given values into the formula for `α2` and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. The following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction formula\n# Let the polynomial be P = 1 + b1*x + b2*x^2 + b3*x^3 + b4*x^4, where x = [SCN-]\ndenominator = 1 + b1 * scn_conc + b2 * (scn_conc**2) + b3 * (scn_conc**3) + b4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the species [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = b2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n>>>16.916180326482276\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we first need to calculate its molar fraction (`α₂`) relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Identify all Cobalt Species**\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   Free cobalt(II) ion: `Co²⁺`\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the species of interest)\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the Molar Fraction (α)**\nThe molar fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is given by the formula:\n`αn = [[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)] / c(Co)`\nwhere `c(Co)` is the total concentration of all cobalt species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Use Stability Constants**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (`βn`):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `c(Co)` allows us to factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Formulate the Molar Fraction Equation for `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\nWe are interested in `α₂`, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Approximate Free Ligand Concentration**\nThe total concentration of the ligand, thiocyanate (0.1 M), is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion, cobalt (0.01 M). Because the ligand is in such large excess, the amount consumed to form complexes is relatively small. We can therefore approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate ions `[SCN⁻]` with its total initial concentration.\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**6. Calculation**\nNow we substitute the given values into the formula for `α₂`:\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1`\n\n**Numerator:**\n`β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n**Denominator:**\n`1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n`= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n`= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`= 2.3646`\n\n**Molar Fraction `α₂`:**\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**Percentage:**\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the molar fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
