    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and Principles:**\n    The problem describes a relativistic harmonic oscillator. This means we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the formula for relativistic energy, combined with the classical concept of a harmonic oscillator, which has a potential energy defined by Hooke's Law. The key principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total energy.\n\n2.  **Define the Total Energy of the System:**\n    In a conservative system, the total energy is the sum of the particle's energy and its potential energy. For a relativistic particle, its total energy is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, assuming the potential is zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system ($E_{total}$) at any point in its motion is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    This total energy must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Energy at Key Positions:**\n    We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's path: the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude) and the equilibrium position.\n\n    *   **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n        The oscillator momentarily comes to a stop before changing direction. At this point:\n        *   The position is $x = A$.\n        *   The speed is $v = 0$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   The total energy is: $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The oscillator passes through its equilibrium position with maximum speed. At this point:\n        *   The position is $x = 0$.\n        *   The speed is at its maximum: $v = v_{max}$.\n        *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   The total energy is: $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Energy:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum displacement must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $E_{total}(x=A) = E_{total}(x=0)$\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    We can isolate $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{max}mc^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$ from $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Now we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for $v_{max}$.\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}\\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the Expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found in step 5 into the equation for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    This derived expression matches option B.\n\n    A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    C) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic result)\n    D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
