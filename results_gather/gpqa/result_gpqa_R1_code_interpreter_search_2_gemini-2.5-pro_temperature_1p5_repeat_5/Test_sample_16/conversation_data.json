    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction and equilibrium.**\n    The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$. The complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    Dissociation Reaction: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the dissociation constant ($K_d$) to the formation constant ($K_f$).**\n    The problem provides the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the reaction $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex. Let 'x' be the change in concentration as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note: The problem states the pH is \"ideal\", which implies we can use the absolute formation constant and don't need to correct for the protonation of EDTA. This means the concentration of the uncomplexed EDTA is simply $[Y^{4-}]$.*\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation.**\n    Using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x.**\n    Since $K_d$ is extremely small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), the extent of dissociation 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows for a simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now, substitute this approximation back into the equation:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root to find x:\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Final Answer.**\n    The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    This value matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation precisely without approximation, we can use a Python script to solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2 \\times 10^{-11})x - (4 \\times 10^{-13}) = 0$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n# The equation is x^2 + Kd*x - Kd*C = 0\nC = 0.02  # Initial concentration of the complex\nKf = 5e10  # Formation constant\nKd = 1 / Kf # Dissociation constant\n\na = 1\nb = Kd\nc = -Kd * C\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n# Since concentration (x) must be positive, we only take the positive root.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nx = (-b + np.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution output:\n6.32e-07\n\nThe code confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, $[CaY]^{2-}$. The high formation constant indicates that the complex is very stable, but it will still dissociate to a small extent.\n\n1.  **Write the Dissociation Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions. The reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    Where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand.\n\n2.  **Determine the Dissociation Constant ($K_d$):** The problem gives the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is $5 \\times 10^{10}$. The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an Equilibrium Calculation (ICE Table):** Let 'x' be the concentration of $[CaY]^{2-}$ that dissociates at equilibrium. Based on the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of both $Ca^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$ at equilibrium will be 'x'.\n\n| Species         | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x M      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0 M         | +x         | x M             |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0 M         | +x         | x M             |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    $2.0 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Since $K_d$ is extremely small, the amount of complex that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the denominator:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n    Now, solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Finally, solve for x by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\nTherefore, $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
