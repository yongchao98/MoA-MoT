    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to identify which stars from a given list can be observed by two specific instruments: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the W. M. Keck Observatory.\n\n2.  **Identify the Constraints for Observation:** A star can be observed by both facilities only if it meets the criteria for *both* simultaneously. The criteria are:\n    *   **Geographic Visibility (Declination):** The star must rise above the horizon at both observatory locations.\n    *   **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):** The star must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of both instruments.\n\n3.  **Gather Observatory Data:**\n    *   **ESPRESSO @ Paranal Observatory:**\n        *   Location: From the Wikipedia link, Paranal is in the Atacama Desert, Chile. A quick search confirms its latitude is approximately 24.6° South.\n        *   Magnitude Limit: Given as V < 17 mag.\n    *   **HIRES @ W. M. Keck Observatory:**\n        *   Location: From the Wikipedia link, Keck is on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA. A quick search confirms its latitude is approximately 19.8° North.\n        *   Magnitude Limit: Given as V < 16 mag.\n\n4.  **Determine Joint Constraints:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** To be seen by *both*, a star must be brighter than the *stricter* of the two limits. The limits are V < 17 (ESPRESSO) and V < 16 (HIRES). The stricter limit is **V < 16 mag**.\n    *   **Declination (DEC):** The user stated to disregard pointing limits and elevations. This is interpreted to mean we should only consider if the star ever rises above the horizon (i.e., is not circumpolar in the opposite hemisphere).\n        *   An observatory at latitude `L` can theoretically see any object with a declination `δ` such that the object crosses the horizon.\n        *   For Keck (Latitude L ≈ +19.8° N), a star is visible if its declination `δ` > L - 90°. So, **δ > -70.2°**.\n        *   For Paranal (Latitude L ≈ -24.6° S), a star is visible if its declination `δ` < L + 90°. So, **δ < +65.4°**.\n        *   For a star to be visible from *both*, its declination must be in the range: **-70.2° < δ < +65.4°**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Each Star against the Joint Constraints:**\n\n    **Constraint Checklist:**\n    1.  Is -70.2° < DEC < +65.4°?\n    2.  Is the apparent magnitude V < 16?\n\n    ---\n    **Star 1:**\n    *   DEC = -75°.\n    *   *Check 1 (DEC):* -75° is *not* greater than -70.2°. It is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion: Not observable by both.**\n\n    ---\n    **Star 2:**\n    *   DEC = +55°.\n    *   *Check 1 (DEC):* -70.2° < 55° < +65.4°. This is OK.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag.\n    *   *Check 2 (Magnitude):* 16.5 is *not* less than 16. It is too faint for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion: Not observable by both.**\n\n    ---\n    **Star 3:**\n    *   DEC = +48°.\n    *   *Check 1 (DEC):* -70.2° < 48° < +65.4°. This is OK.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag. The provided extinction value E(B-V) is extraneous information since the final apparent magnitude is already given.\n    *   *Check 2 (Magnitude):* 15.5 is less than 16. This is OK.\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n    ---\n    **Star 4:**\n    *   DEC = -48°.\n    *   *Check 1 (DEC):* -70.2° < -48° < +65.4°. This is OK.\n    *   Magnitude must be calculated from absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and extinction (A_V).\n    *   Formula: Apparent Mag (V) = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d/10) + A_V\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag.\n    *   d = 10 pc. The distance modulus term `5 * log₁₀(10/10)` is `5 * 0 = 0`.\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   *Check 2 (Magnitude):* 16.74 is *not* less than 16. It is too faint for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion: Not observable by both.**\n\n    ---\n    **Star 5:**\n    *   DEC = +60°.\n    *   *Check 1 (DEC):* -70.2° < 60° < +65.4°. This is OK.\n    *   Magnitude must be calculated. No extinction is mentioned, so A_V = 0.\n    *   Formula: V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d/10) + A_V\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag.\n    *   d = 5 pc.\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   *Check 2 (Magnitude):* 14.995 is less than 16. This is OK.\n    *   **Conclusion: Observable by both.**\n\n6.  **Synthesize Final Answer:**\n    *   The stars that meet all criteria for both observatories are **Star 3** and **Star 5**.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be certain, I will run the calculations through a Python script to avoid manual errors.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_apparent_magnitude(name, M_V=None, d_pc=None, V=None, E_BV=None):\n    \"\"\"Calculates or returns the apparent V magnitude for a star.\"\"\"\n    if V is not None:\n        # Apparent magnitude is given directly.

    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we need to consider two main criteria for each star:\n\n1.  **Visibility from both locations:** A star must be in a part of the sky that is visible from both observatories. This is determined by the star's declination (DEC) and the latitudes of the observatories.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than the sensitivity limit of **both** instruments.\n\nLet's establish the combined requirements first.\n\n**1. Visibility (Declination)**\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory is located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately **+19.8° N**. Ignoring atmospheric refraction and physical obstructions, any star with a declination south of `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°` will never rise above the horizon. So, for Keck, **DEC > -70.2°**.\n*   The Paranal Observatory is located in the Atacama Desert, Chile, at a latitude of approximately **-24.6° S**. Any star with a declination north of `-24.6° + 90° = +65.4°` will never be visible. So, for Paranal, **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 17 (V < 17)**.\n*   HIRES can observe stars **brighter than 16 (V < 16)**.\n*   For a star to be detected by **both** instruments, it must meet the stricter requirement. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16**.\n\nNow, let's analyze each star against these two criteria: **(-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°)** and **(V < 16)**.\n\n---\n**Star 1**\n*   **DEC = -75°**: This declination is outside the required range (it is less than -70.2°). The star is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **DEC = 55°**: This is within the required range.\n*   **Apparent V = 16.5 mag**: This is not brighter than 16 (16.5 > 16). The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **DEC = 48°**: This is within the required range.\n*   **Apparent V = 15.5 mag**: This is brighter than 16 (15.5 < 16). The star is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **DEC = -48°**: This is within the required range.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and extinction (A_V).\n    *   Formula: V = M_V + 5log₁₀(d/10) + A_V\n    *   M_V = 15.5\n    *   Distance modulus: 5log₁₀(10pc / 10pc) = 5log₁₀(1) = 0\n    *   Extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n*   **Apparent V = 16.74 mag**: This is not brighter than 16 (16.74 > 16). The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **DEC = 60°**: This is within the required range.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Formula: V = M_V + 5log₁₀(d/10) + A_V (No extinction mentioned, so A_V = 0)\n    *   M_V = 16.5\n    *   Distance modulus: 5log₁₀(5pc / 10pc) = 5log₁₀(0.5) ≈ 5 * (-0.301) ≈ -1.51 mag\n    *   V = 16.5 - 1.51 = **14.99 mag**\n*   **Apparent V = 14.99 mag**: This is brighter than 16 (14.99 < 16). The star is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the declination and brightness criteria for observation with both spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
