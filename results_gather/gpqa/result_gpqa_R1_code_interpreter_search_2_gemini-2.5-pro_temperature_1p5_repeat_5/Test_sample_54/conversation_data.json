    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down each signal provided:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl carbon of an ester or ketone. In this context, it represents the acetyl methyl group (-O-C(=O)-**CH₃**).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four options are acetates, so this is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Remaining Protons**\n    *   The other signals are at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H).\n    *   The total integration for these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. These 5 protons make up the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part of the molecule.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Chain Length (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\nLet's check the number of protons in the proposed structures, excluding the acetate methyl group which we've already assigned.\n*   **Propenyl group (C₃H₅-):** A propenyl group has 5 protons. This matches the total integration of our remaining signals (1H + 1H + 3H = 5H).\n*   **Butenyl group (C₄H₇-):** A butenyl group has 7 protons. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound must be a **propenyl acetate**, not a butenyl acetate. This allows us to eliminate options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-Ac. The key to distinguishing between these two stereoisomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   Let's analyze the signals from the propenyl group:\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the protons on the double bond (a vinylic proton). It is far downfield because it is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom (-O-Ac). The \"d\" for doublet means it is coupled to only one other proton (the other vinylic proton). The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton. The \"dq\" for doublet of quartets means it is coupled to one proton (the first vinylic proton) and a group of three protons (the methyl group).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the double bond. The \"d\" for doublet confirms it is coupled to one adjacent proton (the second vinylic proton).\n\n*   **Interpreting the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\n    The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons is dependent on their geometric relationship:\n    *   **J-trans (protons on opposite sides of the C=C bond):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **J-cis (protons on the same side of the C=C bond):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusions:\n1.  The proton integration matches a propenyl group (5H), not a butenyl group (7H).\n2.  The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the two vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans-alkene.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
