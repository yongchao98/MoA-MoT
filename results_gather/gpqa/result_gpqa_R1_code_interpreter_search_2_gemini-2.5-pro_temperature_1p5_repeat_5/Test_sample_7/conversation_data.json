As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Role of Gene G2\n\n*   **Single mutant `g2`:** Shows 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype, a complete loss of resistance.\n*   **Double mutant `g1g2`:** Shows 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance) is completely masked by the `g2` mutation. The double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant.\n*   **Double mutant `g2g3`:** Shows 0% resistance. Similarly, the phenotype of the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance) is masked by the `g2` mutation. The double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant.\n\nThis pattern is the definition of **epistasis**. When the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the phenotype of another gene's mutation, the first gene is said to be epistatic to the second. Here, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n\nThe problem states that \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream\". An upstream gene controlling downstream genes would exhibit epistasis. Since G2 masks the effects of both G1 and G3, G2 is the prime candidate for the upstream transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3.\n\n*   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3.\n\nThis conclusion immediately invalidates option B, which states that G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3\n\n*   **Single mutant `g1`:** 75% resistance (a 25% loss compared to control).\n*   **Single mutant `g3`:** 50% resistance (a 50% loss compared to control).\n*   **Double mutant `g1g3`:** 10% resistance (a 90% loss compared to control).\n\nLet's consider the relationship:\n*   **Epistasis?** For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should match the `g1` phenotype (75%). This is not the case. For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should match the `g3` phenotype (50%). This is also not the case. Therefore, there is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3. This invalidates the final clauses of options A, C, and D that claim epistasis between G1 and G3. However, we must choose the *best* option among the flawed choices.\n*   **Additive/Synergistic effect?** If the genes acted in completely separate pathways, their effects might be additive. The loss of resistance from `g1` (25%) plus the loss from `g3` (50%) would be a 75% total loss, leaving 25% resistance. The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than this. This indicates a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of the mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects.\n*   **Gene Redundancy?** Synergistic interactions often imply that the genes have related or partially overlapping functions (i.e., they are partially redundant). They both contribute to the same overall biological process (resistance), and losing both is significantly worse than losing just one. Therefore, describing G1 and G3 as showing \"gene redundancy\" is a plausible interpretation of their synergistic relationship in this context.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nBased on our analysis, the ideal description of the pathway is: G2 is a transcription factor that activates two parallel downstream genes, G1 and G3. G1 and G3 show a synergistic interaction, which can be described as partial gene redundancy.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Plausible and supported by the data (synergistic interaction).\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: This cannot be concluded from the experiment, as only one trait (resistance) was measured.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a statement about DNA sequence organization and cannot be concluded from phenotypic data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect.\n\nComparing the options, Option A contains two statements that are strongly supported by the experimental data (`G2 is a transcription factor` and `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`). The other options contain only one correct statement and other statements that are either incorrect or cannot be substantiated by the data. Despite the error in its final clause, Option A provides the most accurate and comprehensive conclusion based on the available results. It is the \"best fit\" answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
