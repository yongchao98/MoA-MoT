    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** These are protons on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning they are coupled to a single proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, which is why the peak is broad. An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a para arrangement.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   This gives the structure of **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + H4 (ring) + H2 (from NH2) + H2 (from CH2) + H (from CHO) + N + O = **C8H9NO**. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n**2. Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    *   These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the ring is transformed into -N2+Cl-. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Product of Step 1: **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt)**\n    *   When a diazonium salt solution is warmed in the presence of water, the diazonium group (-N2+) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The N2+ is an excellent leaving group and bubbles off as nitrogen gas.\n    *   Product of Step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    *   The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    *   The strong base (KOH) deprotonates this alpha-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n    *   This enolate ion then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde in an aldol addition reaction.\n    *   The initial addition product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n    *   However, the reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is favorable because it creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable.\n    *   The dehydration reaction results in the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.\n\n**3. Determine the structure of the final product.**\n\nThe dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's visualize the final product's structure and name:\n```\n         (4)          (3)       (2)         (1)\n      HO-Ph-CH   =    C    -   C(=O)H\n                        |\n                       Ph-OH\n```\nWhere Ph-OH is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group. The main chain is a butenal (4-carbon aldehyde with a C=C bond). Numbering starts from the aldehyde carbon (C1). The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a \"but-2-enal\". There are two \"4-hydroxyphenyl\" groups, one at position C2 and one at position C4. Thus, the name is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n**4. Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure and missing hydroxyl groups.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product before dehydration. Since heat is used, the reaction is expected to proceed to the condensation product.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; this is not a condensation product.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
