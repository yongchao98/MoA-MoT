    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon and is the final product of hydrogenation, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28%\n    *   Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n    *   To find the ratio of atoms, we divide the percentages by the atomic masses (H ≈ 1, C ≈ 12):\n        *   Ratio C : H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17\n    *   Dividing by the smallest value (7.14):\n        *   C : H ≈ 1 : 1.98 ≈ 1 : 2\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH₂)n is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ) or an alkene (CₙH₂ₙ). Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it doesn't react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. The simplest and most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C₅H₁₀) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z.\n    *   This implies that all the organic compounds in mixtures X and Y (let's call them A, B, C, D) must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. When hydrogen is added, all double bonds are saturated and rings can be opened under severe conditions, but since they all lead to a single cycloalkane Z, they must share the same parent carbon ring structure.\n    *   This strongly suggests Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and that all other substances (A, B, C) are C₆ compounds based on a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and Substance C**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids which does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, Y contains Z. Let's call the other component C.\n    *   So, Y = C + Z (equimolar).\n    *   Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, C must also be a saturated compound.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + Z) gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   How can a saturated compound C be hydrogenated to cyclohexane? This is unusual unless we consider \"severe conditions\". One possibility is that C is an isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane), but a much more common chemical reaction fitting the \"disproportionation\" theme is that C is not fully saturated in the typical sense but does not react with Br₂ water. Aromatic compounds like benzene (C₆H₆) fit this description. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst) and it can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that C is benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C₆H₆) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the \"does not decolorize bromine water\" condition. Hydrogenation of this mixture would convert the benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in pure cyclohexane (Z), which also fits.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y when heated with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   X -> Y can be written as: `A + B -> C + Z` (since X and Y are equimolar mixtures).\n    *   Substituting our identified C and Z: `A + B -> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)`\n    *   This is a classic disproportionation reaction via intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to become benzene, and another molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) to become cyclohexane. For this to happen, the total number of atoms must be conserved.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms on the right side is 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be 18.\n    *   `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = 18`.\n\n5.  **Identify Substances A and B in Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must contain C=C double bonds (they are unsaturated).\n    *   Hydrogenation of A and B gives cyclohexane, so they must be based on a C₆ ring skeleton. Their formulas will be C₆Hₓ.\n    *   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need to find two different C₆ unsaturated molecules (A and B) with a six-membered ring, no conjugated bonds, such that the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   The formula for a cycloalkene with one double bond is C₆H₁₀. The formula for a cycloalkadiene with two double bonds is C₆H₈.\n    *   Let's try A = C₆H₁₀ and B = C₆H₈.\n        *   Sum of hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18. This fits the hydrogen balance.\n    *   Let's check the candidates:\n        *   A = C₆H₁₀. This would be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond and thus decolorizes bromine water. It has no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This works.\n        *   B = C₆H₈. This is a cyclohexadiene. To avoid conjugation, the two double bonds must be isolated. This means it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and is ruled out by the problem statement. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene decolorizes bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This also works.\n    *   So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₈ + C₆H₁₀ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₆ + C₆H₁₂` is a perfectly plausible hydrogen transfer disproportionation. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the ene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
