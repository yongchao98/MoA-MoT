    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This is the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The M+ to M+2 ratio is approximately 100:32 or 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%)).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures. The formula for all options A, B, and D (chlorobenzoic acid isomers and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The M+2 peak would be at 156 - 35 + 37 = 158. This matches the MS data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, specifically for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This rules out option B (an aldehyde) and option C (a chloroformate).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The chemical shift is very far downfield (typically >10 ppm), which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet and integrates to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see a total of 4 aromatic protons, which means we have a disubstituted benzene ring. The key information is the splitting pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This specific pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring due to its symmetry. In a para-disubstituted ring, the two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set of protons splits the other into a doublet.\n    *   A 1,2-disubstituted ring (like 2-chlorobenzoic acid, option D) or a 1,3-disubstituted ring would give a more complex pattern with 4 distinct signals, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and indicates a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern on a benzene ring.\n    *   Putting all the evidence together, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
