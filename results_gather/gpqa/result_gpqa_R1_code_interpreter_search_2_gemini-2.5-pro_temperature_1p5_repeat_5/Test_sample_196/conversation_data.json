    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly deshielded, which means these protons are ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   So far, the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid: `R-C₆H₄-COOH`.\n        *   Now, let's determine the structure of the 'R' group from the remaining signals:\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to multiple, different types of protons. It is coupled to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm (making it a quartet) and the methine group at 2.9 ppm (making it a doublet), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is likely a methine group (-CH-) attached to the aromatic ring (benzylic position). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm (doublet) and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm (triplet), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group 'R':\n            *   Start with the benzylic CH at 2.9 ppm.\n            *   This CH is attached to a -CH₃ group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n            *   This CH is also attached to a -CH₂- group (from the 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n            *   This -CH₂- group is attached to a -CH₃ group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet).\n            *   The complete group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and HI**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** This combination of reagents (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) completely down to a methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to the corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group. The benzene ring and the sec-butyl side chain are already fully reduced and will not be affected by the reagents.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Reaction: -COOH → -CH₃\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced, not rearranged.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches the product from the complete reduction of the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
