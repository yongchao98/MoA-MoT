    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Role of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS)**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the regioselectivity of the reaction (i.e., where the new substituent attaches).\n*   **Activating Groups** (like alkyl groups: -CH3, -C2H5) are electron-donating. They activate the ring (make the reaction faster) and are **ortho, para-directors**.\n*   **Deactivating Groups** (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR) are electron-withdrawing. They deactivate the ring (make the reaction slower). Most are **meta-directors**.\n*   **Halogens** (like -Cl) are an exception. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect (-I) but are **ortho, para-directors** due to their resonance effect (+R).\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n1.  C6H5-CH3: -CH3 is an activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  C6H5-COOC2H5: -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n3.  C6H5-Cl: -Cl is a deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n4.  C6H5-NO2: -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n5.  C6H5-C2H5: -C2H5 is an activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  C6H5-COOH: -COOH is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Initial Sorting**\n\nThe meta-directing substances will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directing substances will produce a much higher yield. This allows us to create two groups:\n\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (meta-directors):** 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), 4 (C6H5-NO2), 6 (C6H5-COOH)\n*   **High Para Yield Group (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (C6H5-CH3), 3 (C6H5-Cl), 5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n\nThe final sequence must be of the form: (Low Yield Group) < (High Yield Group).\n\n**4. Ordering the Low Yield Group (meta-directors)**\n\nFor meta-directors, a stronger deactivating effect leads to a higher percentage of the meta product and, consequently, a lower percentage of the para product. We need to rank them by the strength of their deactivating effect.\n\n*   Deactivating strength order: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n    *   -NO2 is one of the strongest deactivators.\n    *   -COOH is more deactivating than -COOC2H5.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nWhich corresponds to the numerical order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**5. Ordering the High Yield Group (ortho, para-directors)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the para/ortho ratio. This ratio is influenced by two main factors:\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will sterically block the ortho positions, favoring substitution at the less hindered para position.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** These can also influence the relative reactivity of the ortho and para positions.\n\nLet's compare the three o,p-directors: -CH3, -C2H5, and -Cl.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It produces a significant amount of both ortho and para products. It has the lowest para-selectivity among the three. (Para yield ~67%).\n*   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho substitution more, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio and a higher para yield compared to toluene. (Para yield ~94%).\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Although the chlorine atom is less bulky than a methyl group, its very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) strongly deactivates the adjacent ortho positions. This electronic effect makes para substitution much more favorable than ortho substitution, leading to a very high para yield, higher than that of toluene. (Para yield ~89%).\n\nComparing the para yields:\n*   Toluene (1) has the lowest para yield (~67%).\n*   Comparing Chlorobenzene (3, ~89% para) and Ethylbenzene (5, ~94% para). The larger steric bulk of the ethyl group leads to a slightly higher para selectivity than the electronic effect of the chloro group.\n\nSo the order of increasing para yield is:\nToluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5). This does not match any of the options perfectly.\n\nHowever, let's reconsider the provided choices. Option B orders the o,p directors as 1 < 5 < 3. This would imply that the electronic effect of the chloro group is stronger at promoting para-selectivity than the steric effect of the ethyl group. Let's analyze the entire sequence for Option B.\n\nSequence in option B: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n*   **4 < 6 < 2**: This ordering of meta-directors is correct based on their deactivating strength.\n*   **... < 1 ...**: Toluene is correctly identified as the o,p-director with the lowest para yield.\n*   **... < 1 < 5 < 3**: This orders the remaining o,p-directors as Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\nWhile typical experimental data suggests the order is 1 < 3 < 5, option B gets the meta-directors part (4 < 6 < 2) and the position of toluene (1) correct. All other options have more significant errors in their ordering. For instance, option C incorrectly orders the meta-directors (4 < 2 < 6), and option D places the strongest deactivator (4) after others. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer, likely based on a principle or data set where Chlorobenzene is considered more para-selective than Ethylbenzene.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the ordered groups based on the logic that leads to option B:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\nThe complete order is: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl.\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
