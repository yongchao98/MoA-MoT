    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. This points towards isotopes like Deuterium (D), Carbon-13, Nitrogen-15, etc.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3:** X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5:** A precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B.\n    *   **Clue 6:** Substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This is a strong indicator. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Clue 7:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Clue 8:** X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, it means Deuterium (D) is present. This confirms Clue 1, as D is the heavier isotope of hydrogen. The precipitate G must contain deuterium, and so must substance X.\n    *   The violent reaction and its use as a reagent in organic chemistry (Clue 8) strongly suggest a powerful reducing agent. The most common ones are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride)**.\n    *   Now let's revisit the reaction (Clues 2, 3, 4). X (LiAlD₄) reacts with liquid Y. If B (D₂O) is produced from the precipitate, it's plausible that the reactant liquid Y is also D₂O.\n    *   Let's test the reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   **Reaction type:** This reaction is known to be violent, matching Clue 2.\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (Deuterium gas). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, perfectly matching Clue 3.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The precipitate formed is Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known precipitate, so it is certain Al(OD)₃ would be as well. This matches Clue 4.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum hydroxide yields aluminum oxide and water (2Al(OH)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O. So, heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O), matching Clue 5.\n    *   Now, let's verify Clue 7. A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH). LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a powerful enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups to alcohols. The reaction is: R-CO-COOH + [H] -> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. The starting material has 3 oxygens, and the product (a diol) has 2 oxygens. This matches Clue 7.\n    *   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   An \"element\" is defined by its atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Z=1\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z=3\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Z=13\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element** present is **Hydrogen**, and the **heaviest element** present is **Aluminum**.\n    *   The instruction is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in the formula LiAlD₄. The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" confirms we should account for every atom.\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄, we have:\n        *   1 atom of Aluminum (the heaviest element).\n        *   4 atoms of Hydrogen (the lightest element), all as the isotope Deuterium.\n    *   For calculations like this in chemistry puzzles, it is standard to use the integer mass number (protons + neutrons) for each specific isotope.\n        *   The mass number of Aluminum's only stable isotope (²⁷Al) is **27**.\n        *   The mass number of Deuterium (²H or D) is **2**.\n    *   The calculation is: (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Sum = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
