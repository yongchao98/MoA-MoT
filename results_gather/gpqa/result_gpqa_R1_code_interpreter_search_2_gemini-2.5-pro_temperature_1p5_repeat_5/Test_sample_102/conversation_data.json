    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent molecule is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern with three deactivating groups suggests that a simple, direct sequence of substitutions might be difficult or low-yield due to conflicting directing effects or a heavily deactivated ring.\n\n### 3. Evaluate a Simple, Direct Synthetic Route\n\nA seemingly logical route would be to use the *meta*-directing properties of the groups.\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This works well as the acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position.\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the -COCH3 group (at C1) and the -NO2 group (at C3) are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This route is regiochemically sound. However, the ring is very deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the final bromination step difficult and potentially low-yield.\n\nThis direct sequence is not presented as an option, suggesting that a more complex, perhaps higher-yielding, strategy is required.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Provided Options\n\nAll options are multi-step sequences and involve reactions for introducing and then removing an amino group (e.g., Fe/HCl for reduction, NaNO2/HCl for diazotization, H3PO2 for deamination). This is a strong clue that a temporary amino group is used as a powerful directing group to control the regiochemistry, and is then removed. This is a common strategy for complex syntheses.\n\nLet's evaluate each option with this in mind.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) Bromination → ii) Nitration → iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation. Step (ii) would produce a mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) requires a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring containing a nitro group, which is highly deactivated. This reaction fails. So, Option B is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** i) Nitration → ii) Reduction to aniline → iii) Diazotization → iv) Deamination with H3PO2. This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This is a circular and nonsensical route. So, Option C is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This path involves forming aniline, then reacting it under Friedel-Crafts conditions. This can be complex, leading to either N-acylation or ring acylation at the *meta* position (due to complexation of the amine with AlCl3). Subsequent steps, however, do not lead to the correct substitution pattern for the final product. For instance, if 3-aminoacetophenone is formed, subsequent bromination is directed by the strong activating -NH2 group to positions 2, 4, or 6, not the required position 5. So, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail, looking for the \"trick\".\n\n    i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** Standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This step provides the correct 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** Here, we have competing directors: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*) and -Br (at C3, *o,p*). The -COCH3 directs to C5. The less deactivating -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This reaction will produce a mixture of isomers. However, the isomers formed *ortho* to the bromine (C2, C4) are major products. Let's assume we proceed with the **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** isomer, which can be separated.\n    iv) **Product from (iii) + Fe/HCl → 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **Product from (iv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** This is the key step. We are nitrating 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. To avoid uncontrolled reactions and direct correctly, the amino group is first protected as an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3), often *in situ* when using an acid medium like H2SO4 or with acetic anhydride. The molecule is now 4-acetamido-3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects are:\n        *   -NHCOCH3 (at C4): Activating, *ortho, para*-director (directs to C1 (occupied), C3 (occupied), and **C5**).\n        *   -COCH3 (at C1): Deactivating, *meta*-director (directs to **C5**).\n        *   -Br (at C3): Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director (directs to C2, C4 (occupied), C6).\n    The powerful activating -NHCOCH3 group and the -COCH3 group both direct the incoming nitro group to the **C5** position. This provides excellent regioselectivity for this step, yielding **1-(4-acetamido-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    vi) **Product from (v) + NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The acetamido group is first hydrolyzed back to an amino group (-NH2) under the acidic conditions, which is then diazotized to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    vii) **Product from (vi) + H3PO2 → Deamination.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe final product of this sequence is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough complicated, the sequence in Option A utilizes a sophisticated chemical strategy (regiochemical correction via a temporary amino group) to overcome the difficulties of direct substitution. This pathway is designed to provide a high yield of the specific desired isomer. The other options contain steps that are either nonsensical or would fail entirely. Therefore, Option A is the correct sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>"
