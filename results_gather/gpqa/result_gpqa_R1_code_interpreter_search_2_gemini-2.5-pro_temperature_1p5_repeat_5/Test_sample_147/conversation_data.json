    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (formula YF_n) and has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, K). Unlikely to form 5 fluorides.\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Se, Kr). These elements do not form five known binary fluorides.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Sb). Forms SbF3, SbF5. Not five.\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy). Unlikely chemistry.\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. This is very close to the molar masses of elements like Gold (Au, 197.0 g/mol) and Bismuth (Bi, 209.0 g/mol).\n\n    Let's test Gold (Au). If Y=Au (M=197), and we test n=5 for A2, the ratio M(Y)/n = 197/5 = 39.4. This is very close to our calculated coefficient of 40.45, suggesting this is a strong possibility. So let's hypothesize that **Y = Au (Gold)** and **A2 = AuF5**.\n    Let's check the mass fraction for AuF5: M(AuF5) = 197 + 5*19 = 292 g/mol. ɷF = (5*19)/292 = 95/292 ≈ 0.325 (32.5%). This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the small difference can be attributed to rounding or a slight inaccuracy in the problem statement.\n\n2.  **Verify the hypothesis using the other chemical clues.**\n    Let's assume Y = Au and build the story. The problem mentions five binary fluorides are known. For gold, these could be AuF, AuF2, AuF3, AuF5, AuF7 (some of which are unstable or less common, which is typical for such problems).\n\n    *   **A1**: It decomposes into A2 (AuF5) and fluorine. This means A1 is a higher fluoride than AuF5. The logical candidate is **A1 = AuF7**.\n        `AuF7 → AuF5 + F2`\n    *   **Properties of A1**: It's a \"bright-red substance\" and \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" Gold(VII) fluoride would be an extremely powerful oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing xenon. While its color isn't well-documented, a red color is plausible for a high-oxidation-state heavy metal fluoride (e.g., PtF6 is dark red). It should also be unstable at 293 K (20 °C), which fits.\n\n    *   **A3**: It's obtained by fluorinating Y. Direct fluorination of gold typically yields gold(III) fluoride.\n        `2 Au + 3 F2 → 2 AuF3`\n        So, **A3 = AuF3**. A3 also interacts with xenon, which is plausible for the strong Lewis acid AuF3.\n\n    *   **A4 and A5**: A5 is obtained by adding Y (Au) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        `A4 + Y → A5`\n        `AuF_a + Au → AuF_b` (1:1 ratio)\n        This suggests a comproportionation reaction where an intermediate oxidation state is formed. The reaction `AuF2 + Au → 2 AuF` fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. In this reaction, Au(II) reacts with Au(0) to form Au(I).\n        This identifies **A4 = AuF2** and **A5 = AuF**.\n\n    *   **Decomposition of A5**: A5 (AuF) decomposes in water to form two substances. Gold(I) compounds are known to disproportionate into Gold(0) and Gold(III).\n        `3 AuF (+H2O) → 2 Au (solid) + AuF3 (dissolved/hydrolyzed)`\n        This reaction produces two new substances, metallic gold (Au) and a gold(III) compound. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Our logical deduction identifies **A4 as AuF2** (Gold(II) fluoride).\n    We calculate its molecular weight using the atomic masses: M(Au) ≈ 196.97 g/mol and M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    ```python\n    # Molar masses\n    M_Au = 196.966570  # g/mol\n    M_F = 18.998403  # g/mol\n    \n    # Calculate the molecular weight of A4 (AuF2)\n    M_A4 = M_Au + 2 * M_F\n    print(M_A4)\n    ```\n\n    The precise molecular weight of AuF2 is approximately 234.96 g/mol.\n\n4.  **Match the result to the given ranges.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is ~235 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 220-240\n\n    The value 235 g/mol is in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>"
