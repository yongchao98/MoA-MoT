    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a vector field **f** that is defined by its magnitude and direction:\n*   **Magnitude**: `|f| = 1/r^2`, where `r` is the distance from the origin.\n*   **Direction**: The field points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this means the field is in the direction of the radial unit vector, **r̂**.\n\nSo, we can write the vector field as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (`∇ . f`) over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\n\n**2. Choose the Right Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nWe could try to calculate the divergence `∇ . f` directly and then integrate it over the volume. However, there's a problem: the field `f` is undefined at the origin (r=0) because of the `1/r^2` term. This singularity makes direct calculation of the integral of the divergence complicated.\n\nA more elegant and powerful approach is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n\nHere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points outward, normal to the surface.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem allows us to solve the problem by calculating a surface integral, which avoids the singularity at the origin.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the right side of the Divergence Theorem: `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n*   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`**: On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field on the surface is:\n    `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n*   **The surface element vector `dS`**: For a sphere, the differential surface area vector `dS` always points in the radially outward direction, so it's parallel to **r̂**. Its magnitude in spherical coordinates is `R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore:\n    `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n\n**4. Calculate the Dot Product `f . dS`**\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n`f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n\nSince **r̂** . **r̂** = 1 (the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1), the expression simplifies:\n`f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n`f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNotice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This is a key feature of `1/r^2` fields.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `f . dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are:\n*   `φ` from 0 to `2π`\n*   `θ` from 0 to `π`\n\n`∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's perform the integration in steps:\n*   **Integrate with respect to θ**:\n    `∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Integrate with respect to φ**:\n    `∫_(φ=0)^(2π) 2 dφ = [2φ]_0^(2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**6. Final Result**\n\nThe value of the surface integral is `4π`. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence:\n\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin. The value `4π` corresponds to the solid angle of a complete sphere. This problem is analogous to Gauss's Law for a unit point charge at the origin.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
