    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:**\n    The decay of a stationary particle into two product particles is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the energies are given in MeV, which are comparable to the rest mass energies, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n2.  **Define the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) is at rest.\n        *   Initial energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV.\n        *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0.\n    *   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ).\n        *   Final energy (E_final) = E_μ + E_ν\n        *   Final momentum (p_final) = p_μ + p_ν\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   This implies p_μ = -p_ν. The muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    *   So, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Here, E_μ and E_ν are the *total* relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (pμ*c)² + (m_μ*c²)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   For the neutrino: Neutrinos have a very small mass, so for this calculation, we can assume they are massless (m_ν ≈ 0). This is a standard approximation.\n        *   Therefore, E_ν² = (pν*c)² + 0, which simplifies to E_ν = pν*c = pc.\n        *   Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν = E_ν).\n\n5.  **Solve for the energies:**\n    *   We have the energy conservation equation: m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   Substitute E_ν = pc: m_π * c² = E_μ + pc  =>  E_μ = m_π * c² - pc\n    *   Now, we use the energy-momentum relation for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Substitute the expression for E_μ into this equation:\n        (m_π * c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Expand the left side: (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms cancel out: (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(pc) = (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Now, we can solve for 'pc', which is the energy of the neutrino (E_ν):\n        2(m_π * c²)(pc) = (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²\n        pc = [ (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * m_π * c² ]\n    *   As established, KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    *   The total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energies (this is the Q-value of the reaction).\n    *   Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π*c²) - (m_μ*c² + m_ν*c²)\n    *   Since m_ν*c² = 0, Q = m_π*c² - m_μ*c²\n    *   Therefore, KE_μ = Q - KE_ν = (m_π*c² - m_μ*c²) - KE_ν.\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We can now use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# KE_nu = [ (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ] / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# The question asks for the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n# Let's print the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino, rounded to two decimal places.\n# The options list the smaller value first, which corresponds to the heavier particle (muon).\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν). This pair of values matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν_μ).\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Decay reaction: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ\n*   Initial state: π⁺ is stationary (at rest).\n*   Rest mass energy of π⁺ (m_π*c²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of μ⁺ (m_μ*c²): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass of neutrino (m_ν): Assumed to be 0, so its rest energy m_ν*c² = 0.\n\n**Physics Principles:**\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n    *   Therefore, **p_μ = -p_ν**, and their magnitudes are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. We must use relativistic energy equations.\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   E_initial is the rest energy of the stationary pion: E_initial = m_π*c² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   E_final is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n    *   So, m_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν.\n\n**Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)², where p is the momentum and m is the rest mass.\n\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μ*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    *   Since |p_μ| = p, this becomes E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)².\n    *   The total energy E_μ is also the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy: E_μ = m_μ*c² + KE_μ.\n\n*   **For the neutrino (ν_μ):**\n    *   We assume the neutrino is massless (m_ν = 0).\n    *   E_ν² = (p_ν*c)² + (m_ν*c²)² = (pc)² + 0\n    *   This gives **E_ν = pc**. Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: **KE_ν = E_ν = pc**.\n\n**Solving for the Energies:**\n1.  Start with the energy conservation equation:\n    m_π*c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n2.  Substitute E_ν = pc:\n    m_π*c² = E_μ + pc\n    This gives an expression for E_μ: E_μ = m_π*c² - pc.\n\n3.  Now use the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n4.  Substitute the expression for E_μ from step 2 into this equation:\n    (m_π*c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n5.  Expand the left side:\n    (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n\n6.  The (pc)² term cancels out on both sides. Rearrange to solve for pc (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy):\n    (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2(m_π*c²)(pc)\n    pc = [(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * m_π*c²]\n    **KE_ν = pc**\n\n7.  To find the muon's kinetic energy (KE_μ), we use the fact that the total kinetic energy released (the Q-value of the reaction) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies.\n    Total KE = KE_μ + KE_ν = E_initial - (sum of final rest energies)\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π*c² - (m_μ*c² + m_ν*c²)\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π*c² - m_μ*c²\n    Therefore, **KE_μ = (m_π*c² - m_μ*c²) - KE_ν**.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's use the provided values in the derived formulas.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) using the derived formula\n# KE_nu = [ (m_pi_c2)^2 - (m_mu_c2)^2 ] / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = (math.pow(m_pi_c2, 2) - math.pow(m_mu_c2, 2)) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the total KE minus the neutrino's KE\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# The question asks for the kinetic energies of the two product particles, mu(+) and nu.\n# The options list the two values. Let's print them, rounded for clarity.\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (μ+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (ν): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe python code calculates the kinetic energies based on the derived equations. The output shows:\n*   Kinetic energy of muon (μ⁺): 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic energy of neutrino (ν): 29.78 MeV (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThese two values, 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after. Since the initial pion (π⁺) is at rest, its energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    *   E_initial = m_π * c²\n    *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν (where E_μ and E_ν are the *total* relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino)\n    *   So, m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay is zero (since the pion is stationary). Therefore, the total momentum after must also be zero. This means the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   p_initial = 0\n    *   p_final = p_μ + p_ν = 0\n    *   |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy Equations**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is:\nE² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²\n\n*   **For the Muon (μ⁺):**\n    *   E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   The total energy E_μ is also the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy (KE): E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ * c²\n\n*   **For the Neutrino (ν):**\n    *   Neutrinos have a mass that is extremely small and considered zero in this context. So, m_ν = 0.\n    *   E_ν² = (p*c)² + 0\n    *   This simplifies to **E_ν = p*c**. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy. Therefore, **KE_ν = E_ν**.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe have a system of equations. Let's solve for the energies:\n\n1.  From the conservation of energy: E_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν\n2.  Substitute E_ν = pc: E_μ = m_π*c² - pc\n3.  Now use the muon's energy-momentum equation: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n4.  Substitute the expression for E_μ into it: (m_π*c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n5.  Expand the left side: (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n6.  The (pc)² terms cancel out. We can now solve for `pc`, which is the neutrino's energy (KE_ν):\n    KE_ν = pc = [(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * m_π*c²]\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\nKE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\nKE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]\nKE_ν = [8315.67] / [279.2]\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the decay is the difference in rest masses (Q-value):\nTotal KE = m_π*c² - m_μ*c² = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:\nTotal KE = KE_μ + KE_ν\n33.9 = KE_μ + 29.8\n**KE_μ = 33.9 - 29.8 = 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).\n\nThis matches the values in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
