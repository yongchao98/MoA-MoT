    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Governing Principles:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being identical particles with half-integer spin means they are **fermions**.\n    *   Fermions must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (where `m_s = +1/2` for spin up, or `m_s = -1/2` for spin down).\n    *   Because of the two possible spin states (`m_s`), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles (one spin up, one spin down).\n\n2.  **Determine Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (h^2 / 8mL^2)`.\n    *   The problem defines a unit of energy `E = π²ħ² / (2mL²)`. Let's relate this to the standard formula. Since `ħ = h / (2π)`, we have `ħ² = h² / (4π²)`.\n    *   `E = π² * (h² / (4π²)) / (2mL²) = h² / (8mL²)`.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy for a given level `n` is simply `E_n = n² * E`.\n    *   The first few energy levels are:\n        *   `n=1`: `E₁ = 1²E = 1E`\n        *   `n=2`: `E₂ = 2²E = 4E`\n        *   `n=3`: `E₃ = 3²E = 9E`\n        *   `n=4`: `E₄ = 4²E = 16E`\n        *   ...and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   We place 2 particles in the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E₁ = 2 * E`.\n    *   We place the remaining 2 particles in the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed is `2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        `E_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n    *   Ground state configuration: `(2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy promotion of a single particle.\n    *   We take the ground state configuration and promote one particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The new configuration is:\n        *   `n=1`: 2 particles (Energy: `2 * E₁ = 2E`)\n        *   `n=2`: 1 particle (Energy: `1 * E₂ = 4E`)\n        *   `n=3`: 1 particle (Energy: `1 * E₃ = 9E`)\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        `E_1st_excited = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n    *   First excited state configuration: `(2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n        *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n        *   Energy: `2*E₁ + 1*E₂ + 1*E₄ = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n        *   Energy: `1*E₁ + 2*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n        *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n        *   Energy: `2*E₁ + 2*E₃ = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\n    *   Comparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is `18E`.\n\n6.  **Summary of Energies:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = `10E`\n    *   First Excited State Energy = `15E`\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = `18E`\n\n    This sequence of energies corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
