    "This question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key concept is that the electromagnetic field at an observation point $(\\vec{r}, t)$ is determined not by the charge's present position, but by its position and motion at an earlier time, called the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n**1. Definitions and Retarded Time**\n\nFirst, let's clarify the variables given in the problem, which are standard for this topic:\n*   $q$: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t')$: The trajectory of the charge as a function of time $t'$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the point where the field is being measured (the observation point).\n*   $t$: The time at which the field is measured.\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal (which travels at speed $c$) must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'} \\Big|_{t'=t_r}$.\n\nThe relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\nThis is an implicit equation for $t_r$ since $d$ itself depends on $t_r$.\n\n**2. The Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar and vector potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the charge density, $\\vec{J}$ is the current density, and $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n**3. Potentials for a Point Charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)**\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$, the densities are given by:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t')\\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and performing the integration (a standard but non-trivial derivation in advanced electromagnetism textbooks) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The result is:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nwhere all quantities on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n**4. Matching with the Options**\n\nNow, let's manipulate the expressions to match the given options. The denominator is the key part:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nWe can factor out $\\frac{1}{c}$ from the denominator:\n$d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$\n\nSubstituting this back into the potential expressions:\n\nFor the scalar potential $V$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{1}{c}(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese two expressions match exactly with option C.\n\nLet's check the other options for completeness:\n*   A) and B) incorrectly use the static potential form $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which is only valid for a stationary charge and does not account for retardation.\n*   D) has the wrong sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). The minus sign is crucial as it accounts for the Doppler-like effect; if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger, which is physically correct.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
