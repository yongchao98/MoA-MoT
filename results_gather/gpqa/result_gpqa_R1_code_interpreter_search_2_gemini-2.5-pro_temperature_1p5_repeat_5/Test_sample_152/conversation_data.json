    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n**Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the most acidic proton of dimethyl malonate. The α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is highly acidic.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The enolate of dimethyl malonate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The α,β-unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate in a conjugate addition (1,4-addition).\n    *   `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` + `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃` → `p-tolyl-CH(β)[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH(α)⁻-COOCH₃`\n    *   This creates a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final stable product.\n    *   `p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH⁻-COOCH₃` + `EtOH` → `p-tolyl-CH[CH(COOCH₃)₂]-CH₂-COOCH₃` + `EtO⁻`\n\n4.  **Identify Product A:** The structure of product A is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)CH₂COOCH₃`. Let's find the name that matches this structure.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This name is based on a propane (3-carbon) main chain.\n        *   Propane chain: C1-C2-C3\n        *   Substituents:\n            *   two `-COOCH₃` groups at C1 (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n            *   one `p-tolyl` group at C2 (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`)\n            *   one `-COOCH₃` group at C3 (`-CH₂COOCH₃`)\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives the structure `(CH₃OOC)₂CH¹-CH²(p-tolyl)-CH³₂COOCH₃`.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the one derived from our reaction mechanism: The `CH(COOCH₃)₂` group (from the donor) is attached to the former β-carbon, which also has the `p-tolyl` group. This carbon is then attached to the `CH₂COOCH₃` group (the rest of the acceptor). This naming convention is not strictly IUPAC but describes the correct connectivity. So, the name for product **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n**Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:** This is a Stork enamine reaction, which is a type of Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). The enamine is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** The α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium salt.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This serves two purposes:\n    *   It protonates the nitrile-stabilized carbanion formed during the addition. `CH⁻-CN` becomes `CH₂-CN`.\n    *   It hydrolyzes the iminium salt back to a ketone. The enamine group is essentially a \"masked\" ketone that directs alkylation to the α-position.\n\n4.  **Identify Product B:** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position.\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring is reformed.\n    *   The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   This substituent is attached to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n    *   The IUPAC name is based on the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group located at position 3 of the 4-carbon nitrile chain.\n    *   So, the name for product **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative answer, which shows the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`), is a less stable tautomer and not the major isolated product after acidic workup.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):** We are given the product and one reactant, and we need to find the other reactant (C). The reaction is a Michael addition.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Product:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. Let's identify the bond formed during the Michael addition. This bond is always between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core. The C2 position of this core is highly acidic (an active methylene group), making it a potent nucleophile upon deprotonation.\n    *   The substituent at C2 is a `3-oxobutyl` group: `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   The C-C bond formed is between C2 of the dione and the first CH₂ of the butyl chain.\n3.  **Identify the Fragments:**\n    *   **Michael Acceptor Fragment:** The `3-oxobutyl` group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, must have come from an α,β-unsaturated ketone. By placing a double bond between the α and β carbons (the first and second CH₂ groups), we get `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, which is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone). This matches the given reactant.\n    *   **Michael Donor Fragment:** The rest of the molecule is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` which, after losing a proton from C2, acted as the nucleophile.\n4.  **Identify Reactant C:** Therefore, reactant C must be the Michael donor before it was deprotonated.\n    *   Reactant **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
