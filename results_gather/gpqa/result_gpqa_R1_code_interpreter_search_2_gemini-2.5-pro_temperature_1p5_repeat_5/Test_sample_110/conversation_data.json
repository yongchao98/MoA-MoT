    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1\n\n**2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon C1, and the ring carbon C3), so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will deprotonate the ketone at the only available α-position, which is C6, to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The enolate will attack the β-carbon of the double bond.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6 of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   **Step 2 (Michael attack):** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated (usually during workup) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (C3) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   The starting ketone is:\n        ```\n             O\n            //\n         C1--C2(Me, Et)\n        /    \\\n       C6(H, Me)-C5\n       |         |\n       C4 ----- C3\n        ```\n    *   The group added to C6 is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The resulting product structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The options provide names in the format `ethyl 3-(substituent)propanoate`. This means the propanoate chain is the parent, and the complex cyclohexyl group is a substituent.\n    *   When a cyclic system is a substituent, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered as C1 of that substituent group.\n    *   In our product, the attachment point to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ketone. So, for naming purposes, we renumber the ring starting from this attachment point.\n        *   Original C6 → New C1 (attachment point, also has a methyl group)\n        *   Original C1 (carbonyl group) → New C2\n        *   Original C2 (with ethyl and methyl) → New C3\n    *   Now, let's list the substituents on this newly numbered ring:\n        *   A methyl group at New C1.\n        *   An oxo group (=O) at New C2.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at New C3.\n    *   The name of the cyclohexyl substituent is therefore **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the structure for A in options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2\n\n**1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group (the C1 carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also called crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Carbanion formation):** KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ → CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂ + H₂O`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Michael attack):** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CβH=CαH-CN`).\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 (the β-carbon) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The fragments being joined are: `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]-` and `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is \"-nitrile\". The nitrile carbon is C1.\n    *   We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        ```\n              NO₂   CH₃\n               |     |\n        CH₃ — CH₂ — CH — CH — CH₂ — CN\n         6     5     4    3     2     1\n        ```\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   There is a **methyl** substituent at position **3**.\n    *   There is a **nitro** substituent at position **4**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the structure for B in options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = wrong name, B = correct name\n*   B) A = wrong name, B = wrong name\n*   C) A = correct name, B = correct name\n*   D) A = correct name, B = wrong name\n\nThe correct choice is the one where both product names are correct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
