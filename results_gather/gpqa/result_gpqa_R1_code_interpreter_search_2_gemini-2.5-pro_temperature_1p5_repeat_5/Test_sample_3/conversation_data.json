    "*   **Analyze Maxwell's Equations:** Let's review the standard form of Maxwell's equations and what they represent physically.\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀):** This equation relates the divergence of the electric field (how much it spreads out from a point) to the density of electric charge (ρ). It essentially says electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges.\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero. Physically, this means there are no magnetic \"charges\" (or magnetic monopoles) for the field lines to start or end on. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** This equation describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (the curl of E). This is the principle behind electric generators.\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law (∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t):** This equation states that a circulating magnetic field (the curl of B) is produced by either an electric current (J) or a changing electric field.\n\n*   **Introduce Magnetic Monopoles:** The question proposes a universe with \"an isolated North or South pole,\" which is the definition of a magnetic monopole. Let's see how this affects each equation.\n\n*   **Effect on Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):**\n    *   This equation is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles *do not* exist.\n    *   If magnetic monopoles *did* exist, they would be sources (a North pole) or sinks (a South pole) of magnetic field lines, just like electric charges are for electric field lines.\n    *   Therefore, the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero. The equation would have to be modified to include a magnetic charge density term (let's call it ρₘ), becoming something like ∇ ⋅ B = ρₘ.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The equation for the divergence of the magnetic field *must* change.\n\n*   **Effect on other equations:**\n    *   If you have magnetic charges (monopoles), and they move, you would have a *magnetic current* (let's call it Jₘ).\n    *   Looking at the symmetry in Maxwell's equations, an electric current (J) creates a curling magnetic field (in the Ampère-Maxwell law). By analogy, a magnetic current (Jₘ) should create a curling *electric* field.\n    *   This would require modifying **Faraday's Law of Induction**. The equation ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t would need an additional term for the magnetic current, becoming something like ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jₘ.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The equation for the circulation (curl) of the electric field *must* also change.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Circulation of B (Ampère's Law) and flux of E (Gauss's Law for E). Incorrect. These are related to electric charges and currents, which are not directly changed by the premise.\n    *   B) Divergence of the magnetic field. Correct, but incomplete. As we saw, another equation also changes.\n    *   C) Circulation of the electric field (Faraday's Law) and divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss's Law for B). This matches our reasoning perfectly. Both equations would be modified to account for magnetic charges and magnetic currents.\n    *   D) Divergence and curl of the magnetic field. Incorrect. The curl of the magnetic field (Ampère-Maxwell Law) is sourced by electric currents and changing electric fields, which are not altered by the existence of magnetic monopoles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
