    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe problem asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability for a hydrogen atom decaying from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step electric dipole transition process. This implies a cascade decay involving an intermediate state:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{transition 1}} |\\text{intermediate state}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 2. Applying Dipole Selection Rules\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n*   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_i$ can be any integer.\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State\nLet the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, the energy must decrease, so $n' < 3$. Also, the quantum number $l$ must be less than $n$, so $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, we must have $n' > 1$. Therefore, the only possible value for $n'$ is $2$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. All three options A, B, and C present valid intermediate states according to the selection rules.\n\n**Transition 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $|n', l', m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$ (with $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$).\n*   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n    *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$, which is true for all possible $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\nSo, the transition from any of the possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n\nThis confirms that the following three cascade routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe question asks for *the* route and *the* corresponding probability. This implies we need to calculate the probability for one of these specific routes. The overall probability of the decay is split among these three channels. The \"probability\" in the question refers to the branching ratio for a specific path.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Branching Ratios\nThe probability of a specific cascade occurring is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, as the second transition is the only allowed dipole decay path for the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\nThe transition rate $W_{i \\to f}$ for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$W_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nThe initial state is $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. The intermediate (\"final\" for the first step) states are $|f_{m'}\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\nSince the three possible intermediate states are degenerate in energy (in the non-relativistic model), the frequency factor $\\omega^3$ in the full rate formula is the same for all three transitions. Therefore, the branching ratio is the ratio of the squared matrix elements.\nLet's analyze the matrix element $\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle$.\nThe matrix element can be factored into a radial part and an angular part:\n$\\langle n'l'm' | \\mathbf{r} | nlm \\rangle = \\left(\\int r^3 R_{n'l'}(r)R_{nl}(r)dr\\right) \\left(\\int Y_{l'm'}^* \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r} Y_{lm} d\\Omega\\right)$.\nThe radial integral is the same for all three transitions since it only depends on $n,l$ and $n',l'$, which are $(3,0)$ and $(2,1)$ respectively for all paths. So the relative probabilities are determined by the angular part.\n\nLet's calculate the squared norm of the vector angular integral for each $m'$:\n$|\\mathbf{A}_{m'}|^2 = |\\langle Y_{1,m'}|\\frac{x}{r}|Y_{0,0}\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,m'}|\\frac{y}{r}|Y_{0,0}\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle Y_{1,m'}|\\frac{z}{r}|Y_{0,0}\\rangle|^2$.\n\n*   **For $m' = 0$:**\n    The matrix elements for $x$ and $y$ are zero due to the parity of the integrands and selection rules on $m$.\n    We only need to calculate the $z$ component: $\\frac{z}{r} = \\cos\\theta$.\n    $|\\mathbf{A}_0|^2 = |\\int Y_{1,0}^* \\cos\\theta Y_{0,0} d\\Omega|^2 = |\\int (\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}}\\cos\\theta)^*(\\cos\\theta)(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}})d\\Omega|^2 = |\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4\\pi}\\int \\cos^2\\theta d\\Omega|^2$.\n    Since $\\int \\cos^2\\theta d\\Omega = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$, we have $|\\mathbf{A}_0|^2 = |\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4\\pi} \\frac{4\\pi}{3}|^2 = |\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **For $m' = \\pm 1$:**\n    The matrix element for $z$ is zero. We need to calculate the $x$ and $y$ components.\n    Let's calculate for $m'=1$.\n    $\\langle Y_{1,1}|x/r|Y_{0,0}\\rangle = \\int Y_{1,1}^* \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi Y_{0,0}d\\Omega = -1/\\sqrt{6}$.\n    $\\langle Y_{1,1}|y/r|Y_{0,0}\\rangle = \\int Y_{1,1}^* \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi Y_{0,0}d\\Omega = i/\\sqrt{6}$.\n    $|\\mathbf{A}_1|^2 = |-1/\\sqrt{6}|^2 + |i/\\sqrt{6}|^2 + 0^2 = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    Due to symmetry, the calculation for $m'=-1$ yields the same result: $|\\mathbf{A}_{-1}|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSince the squared angular matrix elements are the same for all three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$), the transition rates for the first step are equal.\n$W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = W(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\nThe probabilities (branching ratios) must therefore be equal. Since there are three channels, each has a probability of $1/3$.\n*   Probability of route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n*   Probability of route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n*   Probability of route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
