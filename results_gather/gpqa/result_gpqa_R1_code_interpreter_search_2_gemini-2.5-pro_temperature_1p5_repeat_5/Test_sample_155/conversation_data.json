    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The structure is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence involves two steps:\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a *syn-addition* of an oxygen atom across the double bond. For a symmetrical (E)-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, it forms a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺):** This causes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons. This is an *anti-addition* process, meaning the attack occurs from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen, leading to an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** Let's trace the stereochemistry for each enantiomer of the epoxide intermediate:\n    *   Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane, attack by H₂O at C4 (inverting its configuration from R to S) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 (inverting its configuration from R to S) also yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. This product has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n    *   Starting with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane, attack by H₂O at either carbon will also yield the same *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is a single, achiral compound.\n*   **Mnemonic:** The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation. The rule is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The same two-step sequence is performed.\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** Syn-addition of oxygen to a symmetrical (Z)-alkene results in a single *meso* epoxide. In this case, it forms meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  **Aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺):** The anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide will open the ring.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide, attack by H₂O at C4 (which is, say, R) will invert its configuration to S, yielding (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) will invert its configuration to R, yielding (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting meso compound is achiral, attack at either carbon is equally probable. The two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Mnemonic:** The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation. The rule is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Thus, the meso-diol will have a different retention time than the pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   **Result:** 2 peaks will be observed (Peak 1: meso-diol; Peak 2: racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will interact differently with each of the three stereoisomers. It can separate diastereomers and it can also resolve the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Result:** 3 peaks will be observed (one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
