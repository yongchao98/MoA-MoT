    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo (the fraction of power reflected).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to find T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the ratio using the formula from step 2:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** I'll analyze the terms in the ratio to see which ones cancel out.\n    *   `T_star` and `R_star` are properties of the host star, so they are the same for both planets and will cancel.\n    *   The problem explicitly states that both planets have the *same albedo*, so `A₁ = A₂`. This means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels.\n    *   The constant `2` inside the square root also cancels.\n    This leaves a much simpler expression:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n5.  **Connect to Given Information:** The problem now is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁). The given data includes planet masses and the Doppler shifts they induce. This points towards the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n6.  **Recall the Radial Velocity Formula:** The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K_star), which is the maximum speed of the star towards or away from us, is related to the planet's properties. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the formula is:\n    K_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where:\n    *   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis ('a'):** I need to rearrange the RV formula to solve for 'a', as this is the variable I need for my temperature ratio.\n    *   Square both sides: K_star² = (M_p² * sin²(i) / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    *   Simplify: K_star² = (M_p² * G * sin²(i)) / (M_star * a)\n    *   Isolate 'a': a = (M_p² * G * sin²(i)) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\n8.  **Form the Ratio a₂ / a₁:** Now I can use the expression for 'a' to find the ratio a₂ / a₁.\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(M_p₂² * G * sin²(i₂)) / (M_star * K_star₂²)] / [(M_p₁² * G * sin²(i₁)) / (M_star * K_star₁²)]\n\n9.  **Simplify the 'a' Ratio:**\n    *   `G` and `M_star` are constants and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states both planets were detected via the *transit method*. This is a key piece of information. Transits only occur when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, which means the inclination `i` must be very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. It is safe to assume sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂) ≈ 1, so this term also cancels out.\n    *   This leaves: a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K_star₂²) / (M_p₁² / K_star₁²)\n    *   Rearranging gives: a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K_star₁ / K_star₂)²\n\n10. **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** The problem gives M_p₁ = 7 M_earth and M_p₂ = 5 M_earth.\n        M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (v_r) through the formula Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K_star) is the same as the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ).\n        K_star₁ / K_star₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n        The problem gives Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å and Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å.\n        K_star₁ / K_star₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n11. **Calculate a₂ / a₁:** Substitute the component ratios from step 10 into the formula from step 9.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 * 9) / (49 * 16) = 225 / 784\n\n12. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the result from step 11 back into the simplified temperature ratio from step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    I know that sqrt(225) = 15. I need to calculate sqrt(784). I can test numbers ending in 2 or 8. 20²=400, 30²=900. Let's try 28. 28*28 = (30-2)*(30-2) = 900 - 60 - 60 + 4 = 784. So sqrt(784) = 28.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n13. **Compute the Final Numerical Value:** The options are in decimal format, so I need to compute the fraction. I'll use the provided code interpreter for precision.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe result is approximately 0.5357.\n\n14. **Compare with Options:**\n    A) ~ 1.30\n    B) ~ 0.53\n    C) ~ 0.98\n    D) ~ 1.05\n\nMy calculated value of ~0.536 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. State the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio and Simplify**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nWe can simplify this ratio based on the information provided in the problem:\n*   `T_star` and `R_star` are properties of the star, so they are the same for both planets and cancel out.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the *same albedo*, so A₁ = A₂. This means the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out.\n*   The constant `2` also cancels out.\n\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe problem provides data obtained from the radial velocity (RV) method. The formula for the star's RV semi-amplitude (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK_star = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nwhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that the planets were also detected by the *transit method*. This means their orbits are seen nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees, and `sin(i)` is approximately 1 for both planets.\n\n**5. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis 'a' and Form a Ratio**\nLet's rearrange the RV formula to solve for 'a':\nK_star² = (M_p² * sin²(i) * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (M_p² * sin²(i) * G) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\nNow, we can form the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (M_p₂² * sin²(i₂) * G) / (M_star * K_star₂²) ] / [ (M_p₁² * sin²(i₁) * G) / (M_star * K_star₁²) ]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n*   `G` and `M_star` cancel.\n*   Since `sin(i₁)` ≈ `sin(i₂)` ≈ 1, the `sin²(i)` terms cancel.\nThe ratio becomes:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K_star₂²) / (M_p₁² / K_star₁²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K_star₁ / K_star₂)²\n\n**6. Calculate the Component Ratios**\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p₁ = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p₂ = 5 Earth masses\n    (M_p₂ / M_p₁) = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star₁ / K_star₂):**\n    The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (v), via the formula Δλ/λ = v/c. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum RVs (K_star) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    (K_star₁ / K_star₂) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a₂ / a₁)**\nSubstitute the component ratios back into the equation from step 5:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nNow substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784) = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe result is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
