    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes of these tubes are measured.\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An equimolar mixture of salt A and salt B.\n    *   Total mass of the mixture = 7.20 g.\n    *   The reaction is heating to 200°C without air, and only gases are formed. This means no solid residue is left after decomposition.\n\n*   **Gas Analysis:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong dehydrating agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂.\n        *   The weight did not change. This is a crucial clue: no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacts.\n        *   Reaction: 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s)\n        *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of O₂ produced.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The gas that doesn't react in any of the tubes.\n        *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Products**\n\nThe products of the decomposition are H₂O, O₂, and Gas C. To identify Gas C, we can use the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g).\n\n*   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass of products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * Molar Mass of C)\n*   7.20 g = 4.40 g + (0.10 mol * Molar Mass of C)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂). The elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the original salts.\n\nSo, the decomposition products are:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nWe need to find two salts, A and B, that upon heating decompose to produce only N₂, O₂, and H₂O in the specific molar ratio we found.\n\n*   Molar ratio of products: N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest value (0.025):\n*   Ratio = (0.10/0.025) : (0.025/0.025) : (0.20/0.025) = **4 : 1 : 8**\n\nThe overall stoichiometry of the decomposition is:\n`Reactants → 4 N₂ + 1 O₂ + 8 H₂O`\n\nThe presence of N, H, and O in the products suggests that the salts are ammonium salts of oxygen-containing acids (oxyanions). The fact that no solid residue is formed rules out most metal-containing salts. Let's consider common ammonium salts that decompose upon heating:\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposition is temperature-dependent. At ~200°C, the reaction is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet's see if an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the correct 4:1:8 ratio of products. Let's assume we have `x` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `x` moles of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   The reaction for NH₄NO₃ is `2NH₄NO₃ → ...`, so from `x` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get:\n    *   (x/2) * [2 moles N₂] = `x` moles N₂\n    *   (x/2) * [1 mole O₂] = `x/2` moles O₂\n    *   (x/2) * [4 moles H₂O] = `2x` moles H₂O\n\n*   **Total products from the equimolar mixture:**\n    *   Total N₂ = `x` (from nitrite) + `x` (from nitrate) = `2x` moles\n    *   Total O₂ = `x/2` (from nitrate) = `0.5x` moles\n    *   Total H₂O = `2x` (from nitrite) + `2x` (from nitrate) = `4x` moles\n\n*   **Ratio of total products:** N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2x : 0.5x : 4x\n*   Dividing by `x`, the ratio is 2 : 0.5 : 4.\n*   Multiplying by 2 to get integers, the ratio is **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\nThis matches our experimentally determined ratio perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Verify the Masses**\n\nWe found that the actual moles of products were 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O. Our derived stoichiometry was `2x` N₂, `0.5x` O₂, `4x` H₂O.\n*   `0.5x` (moles of O₂) = 0.025 mol  => `x = 0.05` mol.\nThis means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*3 = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01*2 + 1.01*4 + 16.00*2 = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g.\n*   Total mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g.\n\nThis is in excellent agreement with the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N) atoms: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H) atoms: 4\n    *   Oxygen (O) atoms: 3\n    *   **Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9**\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N) atoms: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H) atoms: 4\n    *   Oxygen (O) atoms: 2\n    *   **Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of each.\nTotal atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
