    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Elucidation of Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane (C10H16) is a rigid, tricyclic alkane. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead (tertiary) carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the formula C10H14Br2.\n2.  **Reaction 1:** Heating C10H14Br2 with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. High temperatures often promote elimination or rearrangement reactions.\n3.  **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   Formula: C10H14O. This is deduced from the ¹H NMR integration (2+10+2 = 14 protons) and the fact that the reaction likely replaces the two Br atoms with one oxygen atom while maintaining the carbon skeleton's saturation (or introducing a C=O bond).\n    *   IR Spectrum: A characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR Spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The signal at 4.79 ppm is exceptionally deshielded for a saturated ketone and is a key structural clue.\n\n4.  **Structural Determination:**\n    *   A simple substitution followed by oxidation (e.g., to 2-adamantanone) is inconsistent with the NMR data. 2-adamantanone lacks any protons above ~2.7 ppm.\n    *   The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) on a strained bicyclic halide system are known to cause skeletal rearrangements. A plausible mechanism involves the formation of a highly strained intermediate (Δ¹,³-dehydroadamantane) or carbocationic rearrangements, leading to a thermodynamically more stable rearranged isomer.\n    *   The product is a C10H14O tricyclic ketone. The unusual NMR spectrum, particularly the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm, is a known feature of **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). The extreme deshielding of the two bridgehead protons (H-1 and H-7) is due to a combination of steric compression and the anisotropic effect of the C-4 carbonyl group in the rigid cage structure.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Elucidation of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, the problem states the reaction is \"heated\", and the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene.\n3.  **Structural Determination:** The MPV reduction of the ketone (Product 1) would first form protoadamantan-4-ol. Subsequent heating in the presence of the Lewis-acidic aluminum alkoxide can then catalyze the dehydration (elimination of water) of this secondary alcohol to form an alkene.\n4.  Therefore, **Product 2 is protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene), the corresponding alkene.\n\n### Step 3: Elucidation of Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup (using DMS). This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n3.  **Structural Determination:**\n    *   Protoadamantene has a double bond between C-4 and C-5. Cleaving this bond opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system.\n    *   The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond in protoadamantene results in the formation of a bicyclic diketone. The product is a known compound: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione**.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n1.  **Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione. This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry (C2v point group), which simplifies its NMR spectrum. It exists in a stable double-chair conformation.\n2.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** We need to find the proton in the most electron-poor environment.\n    *   The structure has two ketone groups at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The bridgehead protons at C1 and C5 are alpha to *both* ketone groups. Protons alpha to a carbonyl are deshielded. Protons alpha to two carbonyls are even more so.\n    *   Other protons (on C3, C4, C7, C8, C9) are alpha to only one or zero ketone groups.\n    *   Therefore, the **most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons, H1 and H5**.\n\n3.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern of H1:** We analyze the neighbors of H1 to predict its splitting pattern.\n    *   H1 is bonded to C1.\n    *   C1 is bonded to three other carbons: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   C2 is a carbonyl carbon, so it has no protons to couple with.\n    *   C8 is a methylene (CH₂) group. H1 couples to the two diastereotopic protons on C8 (H8ax and H8eq).\n    *   C9 is also a methylene (CH₂) group. H1 couples to the two diastereotopic protons on C9 (H9syn and H9anti).\n    *   So, H1 is coupled to a total of **four** neighboring protons.\n\n4.  **Predicting the Multiplet:**\n    *   The splitting pattern depends on the coupling constants (J-values) between H1 and its four neighbors.\n    *   The protons on C8 are in a different chemical environment than the protons on C9. The C8 protons are part of one of the \"side\" six-membered rings, while the C9 proton is the bridging methylene group.\n    *   Therefore, the coupling constant for the H1-H8 interaction (let's call it Ja) is expected to be different from the coupling constant for the H1-H9 interaction (let's call it Jb).\n    *   Assuming that within each methylene group, the couplings are approximately equal (i.e., J(H1,H8ax) ≈ J(H1,H8eq) = Ja and J(H1,H9syn) ≈ J(H1,H9anti) = Jb), the signal for H1 will be split into a triplet by the two H8 protons (n+1=3) and each line of this triplet will be further split into another triplet by the two H9 protons.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n*   (Option D, pentet, would only arise if all four coupling constants were identical or very similar (Ja ≈ Jb). Given the different structural locations of C8 and C9, this is less likely than the triplet of triplets scenario.)\n\nFinal Conclusion: The most deshielded proton (H1/H5) in product 3 is coupled to two pairs of neighboring protons with likely different coupling constants, resulting in a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
