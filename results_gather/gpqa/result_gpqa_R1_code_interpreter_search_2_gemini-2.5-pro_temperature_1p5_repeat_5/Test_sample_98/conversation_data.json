    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the options.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   \"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, so this is consistent with all of them.\n    *   \"One of the signals... is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This means a specific proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, n=1).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, n=2).\n        *   Three neighboring protons (giving a **q**uartet, n=3).\n    *   \"...whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": This means another, different proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, n=1).\n        *   Two neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, n=2).\n        *   Another set of two neighboring protons (giving a second **t**riplet, n=2).\n\nOur task is to find which of the four structures has one proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) and another proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H).\n\n### **2. Analyze the Structures of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's analyze the splitting patterns for the key protons (the methine, -CH-, protons) in each structure. We will assume the chemical formulas are written to represent the connectivity of the main carbon chain from left to right.\n\n**A) `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`**\nThis represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**. Let's draw the structure and label the key protons.\n```\n        CH2CH3 (ethyl on C4)\n        |\n   (Ha)CH   -  (Hb)CH  -  (Hc)2CH2  -  COOH\n    |          |\n   CH3       CH2CH3 (ethyl on C3)\n```\nWait, the formula is `CH3` attached to `CH(C2H5)`, let me correct the drawing based on the line formula.\nThe chain is `CH3(g)-CH(a)(C2H5(d))-CH(b)(C2H5(f))-CH2(c)-COOH`. This is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n                (f) C2H5\n                 |\n(g) CH3 -- (a) CH -- (b) CH -- (c) CH2 -- COOH\n            |\n           (d) C2H5\n```\n*   **Proton Ha (on C4):** It is coupled to:\n    *   1 neighboring proton: Hb on C3. (-> doublet)\n    *   2 neighboring protons: the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (d). (-> triplet)\n    *   3 neighboring protons: the terminal CH₃ group (g). (-> quartet)\n    *   **Splitting for Ha: doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Proton Hb (on C3):** It is coupled to:\n    *   1 neighboring proton: Ha on C4. (-> doublet)\n    *   2 neighboring protons: the CH₂ on C2 (c). (-> triplet)\n    *   2 neighboring protons: the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (f). (-> triplet)\n    *   **Splitting for Hb: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This matches the second required signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A has both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. This is a perfect match.\n\nLet's quickly verify the other options to be certain.\n\n**B) `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n                 (f) C2H5\n                  |\n(d) CH3CH2 -- (a) CH -- (b) CH -- COOH\n                       |\n                      (g) C2H5\n```\n*   **Proton Ha (on C3):** Coupled to Hb (1H), the CH₂ of ethyl group d (2H), and the CH₂ of ethyl group f (2H). **Splitting: dtt.** (Matches one signal).\n*   **Proton Hb (on C2):** Coupled to Ha (1H) and the CH₂ of ethyl group g (2H). **Splitting: dt.** (Not a dtq).\n*   No other proton in this molecule has (1H, 2H, 3H) neighbors to produce a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B does not fit the data.\n\n**C) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`** -> Interpreted as `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\nThis is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n      (f) CH3   (d,e) (CH3)2\n        |        |\n        CH(b) -- CH(a) -- CH2(c) -- COOH\n```\nNo, the line formula reads `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`. Let's correct the interpretation. It is `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`. My initial thought was correct. It's 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\n```\n          (f) CH3\n           |\n(d,e)(CH3)2CH(a) -- CH(b) -- CH2(c) -- COOH\n```\n*   **Proton Hb (on C3):** Coupled to Ha (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (c, 2H), and the methyl group f (3H). **Splitting: dtq.** (Matches one signal).\n*   **Proton Ha (on C4):** Coupled to Hb (1H) and the two methyl groups d and e (6H total). **Splitting: doublet of septets.** (Not a dtt).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C does not fit the data.\n\n**D) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n           (f) CH3\n            |\n(d) CH3CH2 -- CH(a) -- CH(b) -- COOH\n                       |\n                      (g) CH3\n```\n*   **Proton Ha (on C3):** Coupled to Hb (1H), the CH₂ of ethyl group d (2H), and the methyl group f (3H). **Splitting: dtq.** (Matches one signal).\n*   **Proton Hb (on C2):** Coupled to Ha (1H) and the methyl group g (3H). **Splitting: dq.** (Not a dtt).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D does not fit the data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly compound **A**, which is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits both a signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a different signal that is a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
