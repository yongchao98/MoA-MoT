    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR - Signals for H atoms:**\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H (protons on the C6H4 ring).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (protons on a C=C double bond). The splitting patterns (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) are characteristic.\n        *   Two signals for -CH3 groups.\n        *   Crucially, **no signals for -CH2 groups**.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structural fragments from the NMR data:**\n    *   The combination of two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal (which must be a doublet) is a classic fingerprint for a **propenyl group** attached to the aromatic ring: **-CH=CH-CH3**. Let's verify this:\n        *   Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b) (doublet) and H(c) (quartet), giving a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (doublet), giving a **doublet**.\n        *   The CH3(c) protons are split by H(b) (doublet).\n        *   This fragment fits the data perfectly. The formula for this substituent is **-C3H5**.\n    *   The molecule has a second -CH3 group, and it's part of an ester. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). The two possibilities for the second substituent are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. The methyl protons here would be a singlet.\n        *   An acetoxy group: **-OCOCH3**. The methyl protons here would also be a singlet.\n        *   Both of these fragments have the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments to find the molecular formula:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent (-C3H5).\n    *   We have an ester substituent containing a methyl group (-C2H3O2).\n    *   Let's add up the atoms to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester/acetoxy) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the answer by checking the other options:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The identified structure has a benzene ring (DoU=4), one C=C double bond (DoU=1), and one C=O double bond (DoU=1), for a total DoU = 6.\n        *   Let's calculate the DoU for each option using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. (Incorrect)\n        *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. (Correct)\n        *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. (Incorrect)\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. (Correct DoU, but see below)\n\n    *   **Comparing C11H12O2 and C12H14O2:** Both have the correct DoU of 6. However, the formula C12H14O2 has one carbon and two hydrogens (a CH2 unit) more than C11H12O2. To have this formula while maintaining the fragments required by the NMR, a -CH2- group would have to be incorporated into the structure (e.g., as part of an ethyl ester or a butyl side chain). The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH2- signals**, which directly rules out C12H14O2.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
