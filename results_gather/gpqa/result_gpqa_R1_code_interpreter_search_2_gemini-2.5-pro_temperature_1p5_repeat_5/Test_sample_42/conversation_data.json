    "1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\n    Therefore, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Number the Benzene Ring:**\n    The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (the carboxylic acid) is assigned position C1. The numbering of the ring proceeds to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure based on the Description:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the ring according to the problem description, starting with C1 as the carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **Carboxylic acid** is at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) group are meta to one another.**\n    *   **All three (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to one another.** This means if COOH is at C1, then CHO and CN must be at C3 and C5. Let's arbitrarily place the carbaldehyde (formyl group) at C3 and the cyano group at C5 for now.\n    *   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group.** Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3).** The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   **The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.** The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4, and we can place the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C6. This fits the description.\n    *   This placement leaves C2 for the dimethylamino group.\n\n    So, the final arrangement is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n4.  **Verify Numbering:**\n    With this arrangement (2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy), the set of locants is (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n    If we were to number the ring in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise), the substituents would be:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n    This gives the locant set (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), which is identical. In cases of a tie, we use alphabetical order to decide the numbering.\n    The substituents are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n    *   Numbering clockwise: 2-**d**imethylamino, 3-**f**ormyl, 4-**m**ethoxy, 5-**c**yano, 6-**h**ydroxy.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise: 2-**h**ydroxy, 3-**c**yano, 4-**m**ethoxy, 5-**f**ormyl, 6-**d**imethylamino.\n    At the first point of difference (C2 vs C6), we compare 'dimethylamino' and 'hydroxy'. Alphabetically, 'd' comes before 'h'. Therefore, the correct numbering gives the dimethylamino group the lower number (C2). The clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n5.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    The parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n    The substituents with their locants are:\n    *   5-cyano\n    *   2-dimethylamino\n    *   3-formyl\n    *   6-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    Now, arrange these alphabetically:\n    *   **C**yano (5-)\n    *   **D**imethylamino (2-)\n    *   **F**ormyl (3-)\n    *   **H**ydroxy (6-)\n    *   **M**ethoxy (4-)\n\n    Combining them gives: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n    *   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n    The name we derived matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
