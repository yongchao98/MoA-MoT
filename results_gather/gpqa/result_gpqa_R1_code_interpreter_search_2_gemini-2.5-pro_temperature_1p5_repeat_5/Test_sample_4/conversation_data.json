    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operator**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**\n    The operator is to be calculated along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, an arbitrary unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is given by:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\n    For a vector in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. For an arbitrary direction (i.e., not just along the z-axis where $\\sin\\theta = 0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$.\n    So, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n    Here, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n    The operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$, let's call it $P_n$, is the dot product of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Now, let's write this in matrix form:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    (1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    (2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    To simplify this, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities: $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$.\n    $b (2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a (2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$ (i.e., $\\theta \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the ratio $b/a = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n    For a quantum state, the eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm must be 1. The norm squared is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $|C|^2 \\left( (\\cos(\\theta/2))^* \\cos(\\theta/2) + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^* \\sin(\\theta/2) \\right) = 1$\n    Since $a$ and $b$ can be chosen to be real, this becomes:\n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    By convention, we choose the phase of $C$ to be zero, so $C=1$.\n\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n    Let's briefly examine the other options:\n    A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect dependence on $\\theta$ (not $\\theta/2$).\n    B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect because eigenvector components are dimensionless complex numbers, not quantities with units of $\\hbar$.\n    D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Also dimensionally incorrect due to the presence of $\\hbar$.\n\nTherefore, the only valid and correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
