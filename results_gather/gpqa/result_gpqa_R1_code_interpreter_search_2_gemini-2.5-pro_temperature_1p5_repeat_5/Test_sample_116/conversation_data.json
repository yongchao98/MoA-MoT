    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or some form of axial, planar, or helical chirality. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In certain substituted biphenyls, bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, 6') can restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, two conditions must be met:\n        1.  Rotation around the single bond between the rings must be hindered.\n        2.  The molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2). This significant steric hindrance prevents free rotation, so the rings are forced to be in different planes (non-coplanar).\n    *   The substitution pattern is asymmetric. If we consider the molecule in its stable, non-planar conformation, it does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This compound is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. We check if it is a chiral center. A carbon atom is a chiral center if it is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   The groups attached to C2 are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, the C2 carbon is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is bonded to only three atoms (one oxygen and two carbons). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a C2 rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond. A molecule with a C2 axis can still be chiral, but benzophenone's stable conformation is achiral, being superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are in a *trans* position relative to the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. There are no chiral centers.\n    *   It possesses several elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate), but this is not a form of optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds **3** and **4** are achiral and do not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
