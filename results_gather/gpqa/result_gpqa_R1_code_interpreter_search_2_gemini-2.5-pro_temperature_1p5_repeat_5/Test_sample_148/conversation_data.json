    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** Roughly equal integrals, summing to 1H.\n    *   **Implication:** This indicates the presence of two distinct chemical species, each containing that alpha-proton, in approximately a 1:1 ratio. The alpha-proton in each species is in a slightly different chemical environment, hence the different chemical shifts.\n    *   **Ruled-out explanation:** Spin-spin coupling is excluded, which is appropriate as coupling would typically split a single peak into a multiplet (doublet, triplet, etc.), not create a completely separate peak at a different chemical shift.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    *   **Implication:** This confirms the presence of two different species that can be physically separated by chromatography because they have different interactions with the stationary phase. The equal intensities confirm the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule.\n    *   **Implication:** The two species are isomers; they have the same chemical formula and the same mass, but different structures. This rules out impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular weights.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a product with a different molecular formula and thus a different mass. The MS data contradicts this.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Under standard (achiral) conditions, they have identical physical and chemical properties, including their NMR spectra and their retention times on a standard (achiral) LC column. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would show only one peak in the NMR and one peak in the LC. This is inconsistent with the observations.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule with a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected* product, which contradicts this.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties. The corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers are in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. This perfectly explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated using standard (achiral) chromatography. This explains the two separate peaks in the LC. As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, explaining why both peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Plausibility:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the amino acid starting materials racemizes at its alpha-carbon (a common side reaction called epimerization), coupling it to the rest of the chiral peptide chain will create a mixture of diastereomers. For example, synthesizing a dipeptide from L-Alanine and L-Valine could result in L-Ala-L-Val (the desired product) and D-Ala-L-Val (the diastereomeric impurity).\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of a diastereomeric mixture is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the provided NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
