    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe problem describes a particle annihilation process: a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and annihilate, producing four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). In any such isolated reaction, two fundamental physical principles must be obeyed:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total relativistic energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total relativistic energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n\n*   The system consists of a proton and an antiproton.\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, where energies are measured in MeV (Mega-electron Volts), this implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can approximate its initial kinetic energy as zero.\n*   Typically, such experiments involve firing a particle beam at a stationary target. Therefore, we assume the proton is at rest.\n*   **Initial Momentum:** Since both the proton and the antiproton are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero ($P_{initial} \\approx 0$).\n*   **Initial Energy:** The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest energy ($E_0$) of a particle is given by Einstein's famous equation, $E_0 = mc^2$.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is the same as that of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). From standard data, the rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n\n*   The system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Final Momentum:** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_{final} = 0$). This means the four created particles must fly off in directions such that their momentum vectors sum to zero.\n*   **Final Energy:** The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single moving particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n    *   To conserve momentum (starting from zero), the available energy must be distributed equally among the four identical final particles. Therefore, each particle A will have the same speed ($v_A$) and the same energy ($E_A$).\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy and Solve**\n\nNow, we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\nFirst, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n$1876 = 1200 \\gamma_A$\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNext, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v_A$. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4093} = \\sqrt{0.5907} \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of each particle A is $v_A \\approx 0.769c$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a more precise value for the proton's rest energy ($m_p c^2 = 938.272$ MeV) and a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use a more precise value for the proton's rest energy in MeV\nmp_c2 = 938.272\n# Rest energy of particle A in MeV from the problem\nmA_c2 = 300\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy.\n# System is a proton and an antiproton, both considered at rest.\nE_initial = 2 * mp_c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy of a single final particle 'A'.\n# The initial energy is equally distributed among the four final particles.\nE_A = E_initial / 4\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A.\n# The total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c^2\ngamma = E_A / mA_c2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the velocity ratio (beta = v/c) from gamma.\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.3f}c\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.769c\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem is solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in a particle-antiparticle annihilation.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   **System:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest. The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is therefore the sum of their rest energies.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV.\n    *   The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum:** Since both particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n\n*   **System:** Four particles result from the annihilation: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass ($m_A$).\n*   **Given:** The rest energy of each particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Energy:** The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Momentum:** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. To achieve a net momentum of zero, the total initial energy must be distributed equally among the four identical final-state particles. Therefore, each particle A will have the same energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v_A$).\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\nWe equate the initial and final energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nSolving for the total energy of a single particle A:\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nThe total energy of a particle A is related to its rest energy and velocity by the equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNow, we solve for the velocity $v_A$. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$:\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\nSquaring both sides:\n$\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A \\approx 0.769c$. This value rounds to $0.77c$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
