    "This problem requires us to calculate two quantities in the framework of special relativity: the relative speed between two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (`v_rel`)**\n\nLet the stationary frame be S. The velocities of the two astronauts in frame S are:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c` (for astronaut of mass 2m)\n*   `v2 = 0.5c` (for astronaut of mass 3m)\n\nWe need to find the speed of the second astronaut as observed by the first astronaut. We use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. Let the frame of the first astronaut be S'. The velocity of the second astronaut in frame S' (`v'2`) is given by:\n\n`v'2 = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`v'2 = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v'2 = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v'2 = -0.1c / 0.7`\n`v'2 ≈ -0.142857c`\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is `v_rel = |-0.142857c| ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n*   **Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n    *   `m1 = 2m`\n    *   `v1 = 0.6c`\n    *   `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n*   **Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n    *   `m2 = 3m`\n    *   `v2 = 0.5c`\n    *   `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 ≈ 5.9641 mc^2`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can set c=1 for simplicity and add it back at the end.\nm = 1 # We can set m=1 and add it back at the end.\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 * m\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 * m\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- 1. Relative Speed ---\nv_rel = abs((v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c**2))\n\n# --- 2. Total Energy ---\n# Gamma factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1/c)**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * c**2\n\n# Gamma factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2/c)**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * c**2\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {E_total:.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n> v_rel = 0.14c\n> E = 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values are `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`. Comparing these results with the given options, we find that option A is the correct match.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the speed of the second astronaut relative to the first, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1` be the velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) and `v2` be the velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m), both measured in a stationary frame of reference.\n\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nThe velocity of astronaut 2 as observed by astronaut 1 (`v_rel`) is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\n`v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ -0.142857c`\n\nThe speed is the magnitude of this velocity, so `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`. The negative sign simply indicates that from the perspective of the faster astronaut (astronaut 1), the slower astronaut (astronaut 2) appears to be moving backward.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the individual energies of its components. The relativistic energy of a single particle is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n*   **Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n    *   Mass `m1 = 2m`\n    *   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n*   **Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n    *   Mass `m2 = 3m`\n    *   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding the results to two decimal places, we get:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese values match the ones provided in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
