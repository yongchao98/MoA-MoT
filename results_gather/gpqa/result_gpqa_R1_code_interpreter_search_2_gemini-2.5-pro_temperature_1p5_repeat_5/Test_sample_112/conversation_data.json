    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (spanning roughly 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this is almost certainly the C=O of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n        This provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   From the FTIR and Mass Spec data, we have definitively identified a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   From the FTIR and 1H NMR data, we have identified a **carbon-carbon double bond** (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    Our unknown compound has:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) -> Contributes 1 to DoU.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) -> Contributes 1 to DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total DoU for the correct formula must be at least **2**.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for each option and check the oxygen count:\n    *   **A) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygen count: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This is insufficient for both a C=O and a C=C bond. *Incorrect.*\n    *   **B) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond. *Correct.*\n    *   **C) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygen count: 1. This is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. *Incorrect.*\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygen count: 2. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), but it does not have the additional degree of unsaturation required for the C=C bond. *Incorrect.*\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Only the formula C6H10O2 fits all the experimental evidence: it has the two oxygens required for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl double bond and the alkene double bond.\n\n<<<B>>>"
