    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the reference frame of the Galaxy.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's own reference frame (the proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the ejecta's frame by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   First, we combine the formulas for distance and time dilation:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Next, let's calculate the values needed for the formula.\n        *   The product of velocity and proper time: `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This is the distance the ejecta would travel if there were no relativistic effects (this is also the distance from the Galaxy's perspective in the ejecta's frame, due to length contraction, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame).\n        *   The ratio of speeds squared: `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (1/5)² = 0.2² = 0.04`.\n        *   The term under the square root: `1 - (v²/c)² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`.\n    *   Now, substitute these values back into the combined formula for distance:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Compute the final result:**\n    *   We will use a small Python script to get the precise value of `3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndistance = 3000000 / math.sqrt(0.96)\nprint(distance)\n```",
    "The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) 2 940 000 km\nB) 3 060 000 km\nC) 2 880 000 km\nD) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated value is very close to option B, which is 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding or the precision used for the speed of light in the problem's intended solution.\n\nFinal answer seems to be B. Let's re-verify the reasoning. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*.\nThis distance is `d_galaxy = v * t_galaxy`.\nTime dilation tells us that `t_galaxy = γ * t_ejecta`.\nSo, `d_galaxy = v * γ * t_ejecta`.\n\n`v = 60,000 km/s`\n`t_ejecta = 50 s`\n`c = 300,000 km/s`\n`β = v/c = 60000/300000 = 0.2`\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n`t_galaxy = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n`d_galaxy = 60000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 = 3000000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nThe calculation is correct.\nThe result is approximately 3,061,862 km.\nOption B, 3,060,000 km, is the closest answer.\n\nLet's assume the question implicitly rounds the value. The reasoning and calculation steps are sound. The result points strongly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
