    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound E.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound A.**\n\n*   Hint (a) tells us that Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide in a Wittig reaction to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.\n*   The Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into an alkene (C=C). The structure of the alkene product allows us to deduce the structure of the starting carbonyl compound (Compound A) and the ylide.\n*   The product is `1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane`. The \"propan-2-ylidene\" group is `=C(CH₃)₂`. This means the ylide used was isopropylidenetriphenylphosphorane, `Ph₃P=C(CH₃)₂`.\n*   To find Compound A, we reverse the reaction: we replace the `=C(CH₃)₂` group on the product with a carbonyl group (`=O`).\n*   The product structure is a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and the `=C(CH₃)₂` group at position 4.\n    ```\n            C1(Me)--C2(Me)\n           /          \\\n          C5          C3\n           \\         /\n             C4=C(CH₃)₂\n    ```\n*   Replacing the double bond with a carbonyl gives the structure of Compound A: `1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-4-one`.\n*   Let's find the proper IUPAC name for this ketone. The carbonyl group (`C=O`) is given the highest priority and the lowest possible number. So, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group (originally C4) is renumbered as C1.\n    ```\n           (was C1)Me-C--C-Me(was C2)\n                      |  |\n                      C--C\n                       \\/\n                       C=O (now C1)\n    ```\n    Renumbering from the new C1, the methyl groups are located at positions 3 and 4.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n*   Hint (b) supports this conclusion. The IR peak at ~1750 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch in a five-membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone), which has higher ring strain than a six-membered or acyclic ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Compound B.**\n\n*   The reaction is: Compound A + HCN → Compound B.\n*   This is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin.\n*   The C=O group of 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is converted to a carbon atom bonded to both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a cyano (-CN) group.\n*   **Compound B is 1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentanecarbonitrile**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Compound C.**\n\n*   The reaction is: Compound B + H₂/Pd → Compound C.\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation. H₂/Pd is a strong reducing agent that reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂).\n*   **Compound C is (1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methanamine**. The structure has an -OH group and a -CH₂NH₂ group attached to C1 of the cyclopentane ring, and methyl groups at C3 and C4.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of Compounds D and E.**\n\n*   The reaction is: Compound C + HNO₂ → Compound D → Compound E + inert gas.\n*   This is the Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement. Primary amines react with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form an unstable diazonium salt (Compound D).\n*   Compound C is a 1-aminoalkyl-1-cycloalkanol. The diazonium salt (D) rapidly decomposes by losing nitrogen gas (N₂, the \"inert gas\") to form a carbocation.\n    ```\n    R-CH₂NH₂ + HNO₂  →  [R-CH₂-N₂⁺] (Compound D)  →  R-CH₂⁺ + N₂\n    ```\n    where R is the `1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl` group.\n*   The initially formed primary carbocation `R-CH₂⁺` is highly unstable and undergoes a rapid rearrangement. In this specific case, a ring-expansion occurs. One of the adjacent C-C bonds of the ring (e.g., the C1-C2 bond) migrates to the electron-deficient `CH₂⁺` carbon.\n*   This 1,2-alkyl shift expands the five-membered cyclopentane ring into a six-membered cyclohexane ring. The positive charge is transferred to the carbon that lost the alkyl group (C1), which is stabilized by the attached -OH group (forming a protonated ketone).\n*   Let's trace the positions of the methyl groups during this rearrangement:\n    *   Starting cation: The `CH₂⁺` is attached to C1 of a `3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl` ring.\n    *   Ring expansion: The 5-membered ring and the `CH₂⁺` group combine to form a 6-membered ring.\n    *   The new carbonyl group forms at the position of the original C1.\n    *   Tracing the carbon chain from the new C=O group, one methyl group ends up at position 3, and the other ends up at position 4.\n*   The final product, after the rearranged cation loses a proton, is a ketone.\n*   **Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexanone**.\n*   Hint (b) confirms this structure. The IR peak for Compound E is at ~1715 cm⁻¹, which is the characteristic C=O stretching frequency for a saturated six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and corroboration from the IR spectral data, Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
