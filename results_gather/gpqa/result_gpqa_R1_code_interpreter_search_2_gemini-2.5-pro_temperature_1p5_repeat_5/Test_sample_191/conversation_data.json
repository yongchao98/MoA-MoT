    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\n**1. Analyze the initial state:**\n*   We have an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R. This means its net charge is zero.\n*   It has a spherical cavity of radius r inside, with its center offset by a distance s from the conductor's center.\n*   A point charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n**2. Charge Induction:**\n*   The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. A total charge of -q will accumulate on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This happens because, by Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero. A Gaussian surface drawn within the conductor's material enclosing the cavity must enclose a net charge of zero. Thus, +q (point charge) + Q_inner_surface = 0, which means Q_inner_surface = -q.\n*   The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of -q has moved to the inner surface, a charge of +q must be left behind. To maintain electrostatic equilibrium, this excess positive charge +q will move as far away from itself and from the initial +q charge as possible. It will therefore distribute itself on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n**3. Electric Field Outside the Conductor:**\n*   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    1.  The original point charge +q inside the cavity.\n    2.  The induced charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    3.  The induced charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   A fundamental property of conductors is **electrostatic shielding**. The charge distribution on the inner surface (-q) arranges itself in such a way as to completely cancel the electric field produced by the point charge (+q) for all points outside the cavity. Therefore, the net electric field at point P from the combination of the charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner wall is zero.\n*   This means the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the induced charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor.\n*   Because the outer surface is a sphere and it's shielded from the non-symmetric arrangement inside, the charge +q will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer spherical surface.\n*   According to the shell theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n*   The total charge on the outer surface is +q.\n*   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance L from point P.\n*   Therefore, the electric field at point P is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.\n*   The magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   The details about the cavity's size (r), its position (s), the distance from P to the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are included to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n*   The correct expression for the electric field at point P is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
