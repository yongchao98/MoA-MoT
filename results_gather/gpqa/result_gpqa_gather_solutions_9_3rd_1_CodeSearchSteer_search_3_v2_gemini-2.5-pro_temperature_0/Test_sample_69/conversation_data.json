Systematic Identification of Compounds**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly follow a logical pathway to identify the unknown compounds. The most robust method, used by all, is to start with the most specific chemical clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, strongly suggests a disproportionation. The reaction `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)` is a perfect match.\n    *   **A** = Sulfur (**S**)\n    *   **C** = Sulfur dichloride (**SCl₂**)\n    *   **F** = Hydrochloric acid (**HCl**, a strong acid)\n    *   **G** = Sulfurous acid (**H₂SO₃**, a weak acid formed from SO₂ in water)\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This clue provides crucial stoichiometric confirmation. The stable solid allotrope of sulfur (`A`) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. The gas `B` must be chlorine (**Cl₂**) to form `C` (**SCl₂**), which is a cherry-red liquid (\"bright red product\").\n    *   The balanced reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This shows that 1 mole of `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of `B` (Cl₂), perfectly matching the clue.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We know `B` is `Cl₂`. A common 1:1 reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`.\n    *   **D** = Ethene (**C₂H₄**)\n    *   **H** = 1,2-dichloroethane (**C₂H₄Cl₂**), a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Using the identified compounds: `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) → E`.\n    *   This is the Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n    *   This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, which fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\" perfectly.\n\n**2. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom with two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry at the sulfur. The two chloroethyl groups are flexible.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not linear, ruling out **D∞h**.\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, ruling out **D4h**.\n    *   The choice is between **C2v** and **C2**. To have C2v symmetry, the molecule would require two mirror planes. This would force it into a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas is a staggered, non-planar structure. This structure's only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a single two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**3. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2\nC) D∞h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Puzzle\nThe problem requires identifying a series of unknown compounds (A-H) based on four reaction clues, and then determining the molecular symmetry of the final product, E. The most robust method is to find a single chemical pathway that consistently satisfies all clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This is the most chemically descriptive clue. A hydrolysis reaction that regenerates the starting solid `A` and produces two different acids (one strong, one weak) is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a perfect match:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This allows us to hypothesize:\n    *   **C** = `SCl₂` (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **A** = `S` (Elemental Sulfur, a solid)\n    *   **F** = `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n    *   **G** = `H₂SO₃` (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed from SO₂ in water)\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check. The stable solid allotrope of sulfur (`A`) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. To form `C` (`SCl₂`), gas `B` must be **Cl₂**. The balanced reaction is:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of `A` (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of `B` (`Cl₂`). This perfect 1:8 ratio, along with the fact that `SCl₂` is a cherry-red liquid (\"bright red product\"), strongly confirms these identities.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We have identified `B` as `Cl₂`. A common 1:1 gas-phase reaction that forms a solvent is the addition of chlorine to ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This identifies:\n    *   **D** = `C₂H₄` (Ethene)\n    *   **H** = `C₂H₄Cl₂` (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Using our identified compounds: `C` (`SCl₂`) reacts with 2 equivalents of `D` (`C₂H₄`).\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom with two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry at the sulfur atom. The two chloroethyl groups are flexible due to rotation around single bonds.\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:** We must consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, which rules out **D∞h**.\n    *   It does not have the high degree of symmetry of a square planar molecule, which rules out **D4h**.\n    *   The choice is between **C2v** and **C2**. For a molecule to have C2v symmetry, it must possess two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to adopt a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas is non-planar. It possesses only one non-trivial symmetry element: a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n3.  **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Step 3: Select the Final Answer\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**. Matching this result to the provided options:\nA) D4h\nB) C2\nC) C2v\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this chemical puzzle by systematically identifying each unknown compound (A through H). I will start with the most chemically specific clues to form a hypothesis and then use the other clues, especially the one with a precise stoichiometric ratio, to verify it. Once the identity of the hazardous product E is confirmed, I will analyze its molecular structure to determine its point group symmetry and select the correct option.\n\nI will structure my reasoning within a Python code block, using `print` statements to outline each logical step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemical_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemical puzzle\n    and determine the molecular symmetry of compound E.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the most specific clue to form a hypothesis.\")\n    print(\"Clue 3: 'C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.

The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a perfect match:\n2SCl₂ + 2H₂O -> S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)\nThis suggests:\n  - A = Sulfur (S), a solid.\n  - C = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂).\n  - F = Hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid.\n  - G = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (from SO₂ in water).\n--------------------\nStep 2: Verify the hypothesis with the stoichiometric clue.\nClue 1: 'reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.'\nThe stable solid allotrope of sulfur (A) is the S₈ ring.

Deconstruction and Analysis of the Clues**\n\nThe puzzle can be solved by finding a single, consistent set of chemical identities that satisfies all four clues. The most specific clues should be used as starting points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Start with the most specific clue.** Clue 3 is the most chemically descriptive.\n    *   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    *   This describes a hydrolysis reaction where a compound disproportionates, regenerating the starting element (A). This is characteristic of certain non-metal halides. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a perfect match:\n        `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   This allows us to hypothesize:\n        *   **A** = Sulfur (S), a solid.\n        *   **C** = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂).\n        *   **F** = Hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid.\n        *   **G** = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (formed when SO₂ dissolves in water).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Use stoichiometry to verify the hypothesis.** Clue 1 provides a very specific ratio that must be satisfied.\n    *   **Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   Using our hypothesis: A = Sulfur, C = SCl₂. This means B must be Chlorine (Cl₂). SCl₂ is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The stable allotrope of solid sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This perfect match strongly confirms our identifications.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Use the confirmed identities to solve the remaining clues.**\n    *   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   We know B is Chlorine (Cl₂). A common 1:1 addition reaction involving chlorine gas is with an alkene. Let's test ethene:\n        `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   This fits perfectly: Gas **D** is Ethene (C₂H₄), and the solvent **H** is 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂).\n\n    *   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n    *   The product, **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**, is the chemical warfare agent **Mustard Gas**. This fits the \"extremely hazardous product\" description.\n\n**2. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of the product E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyze the 3D structure and conformation.** The molecule is **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n    *   The central sulfur atom has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry at the sulfur atom.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds. We must consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, so **D4h** is incorrect.\n    *   The choice is between **C₂v** and **C₂**. A `C₂v` point group requires the presence of two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. For mustard gas, any conformation with a mirror plane would have high steric strain (e.g., an eclipsed conformation) and would not be the most stable state.\n    *   The lowest-energy conformation of mustard gas is chiral (lacks mirror planes) but possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Assign the correct point group.** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**3. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**. Matching this with the given options:\nA) D∞h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D4h\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Compounds\n\nThe most effective way to solve this puzzle is to use the most specific chemical clues to form a hypothesis and then verify it with the other clues.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`. This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, is characteristic of a disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride is a classic example that fits this description.\n    *   Let's test the reaction for sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction fits perfectly:\n        *   **C** = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A** = S (Elemental sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F** = HCl (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G** = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed when SO₂ dissolves in water)\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1:** `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`. This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check.\n    *   The stable allotrope of solid sulfur (`A`) at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Gas `B` must be **Chlorine (Cl₂)** to form the chloride `C`.\n    *   Product `C` is **SCl₂**, which is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas `B` (Cl₂). This perfect match strongly confirms our identifications.\n\n3.  **Identify D and H with Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`.\n    *   We know `B` is chlorine gas (Cl₂). A common 1:1 addition reaction involving chlorine is with an alkene.\n    *   The reaction `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)` fits the description.\n    *   This identifies **D** as **Ethene (C₂H₄)** and **H** as **1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`.\n    *   We have `C = SCl₂` and `D = C₂H₄`.\n    *   The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, is the chemical warfare agent **Mustard Gas**, which is extremely hazardous. This confirms the identity of **E**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the geometry around it is bent.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** We must consider the most stable, lowest-energy conformation of the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, so **D4h** is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance between the two large chloroethyl groups.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas is a staggered, non-planar structure. This structure possesses only one non-trivial symmetry element: a **two-fold rotational axis (C₂)** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element, E) is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D∞h\nC) D4h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and, ultimately, the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\nHere is a careful, step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Most Descriptive Clue (Clue 3):** The reaction `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` is the most informative starting point. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` suggests a disproportionation reaction. A well-known reaction that fits this pattern is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This hypothesis fits perfectly:\n    *   **A** = **S** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   **C** = **SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n    *   **F** = **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G** = **H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, formed from SO₂ in water), a weak acid.\n\n2.  **Verify with the Stoichiometric Clue (Clue 1):** The reaction `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C` provides a crucial confirmation.\n    *   The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur (A) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   To form C (SCl₂), gas B must be **Cl₂** (Chlorine).\n    *   The product C (SCl₂) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   Let's check the balanced equation: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of B (Cl₂).

F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a perfect match:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This allows us to hypothesize:\n    *   **A** = Sulfur (**S**), a solid.\n    *   **C** = Sulfur dichloride (**SCl₂**).\n    *   **F** = Hydrochloric acid (**HCl**), a strong acid.\n    *   **G** = Sulfurous acid (**H₂SO₃**), a weak acid (formed from SO₂ in water).\n\n*   **Verification (Clue 1):** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check. The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur (`A`) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. To form `C` (SCl₂), gas `B` must be **Cl₂**. Let's check the balanced equation:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of `B` (Cl₂). This perfect 1:8 ratio strongly confirms our hypothesis. Additionally, SCl₂ is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   **Identifying D and H (Clue 4):** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    We know `B` is chlorine gas (Cl₂). A common 1:1 addition reaction involving Cl₂ is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This fits perfectly, as the product, 1,2-dichloroethane (`H`), is a common solvent.\n    *   **D** = Ethene (**C₂H₄**).\n    *   **H** = 1,2-dichloroethane (**C₂H₄Cl₂**).\n\n*   **Identifying E (Clue 2):** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Substituting our known compounds:\n    `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.

For mustard gas, any conformation that has a mirror plane (e.g., a planar, eclipsed structure) would suffer from high steric hindrance and would not be the lowest-energy, most stable state.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas is a staggered, non-planar structure. This structure lacks any mirror planes. However, it does possess a single **C₂ rotational axis** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (other than the identity element) is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently identifies E as mustard gas, and the symmetry analysis shows its point group is **C₂**.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Solution Process\n\nAll candidate answers follow a consistent and robust logical pathway to solve the problem. The process can be broken down into two main parts: solving the chemical puzzle and determining the molecular symmetry.\n\n**Part 1: Solving the Chemical Puzzle**\n\nThis part involves identifying the unknown compounds A through H.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Choosing the Optimal Starting Clue.** All solutions correctly identify Clue 3 (`C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`) as the most descriptive starting point. This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, strongly suggests a disproportionation. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`) is identified as a perfect match. This establishes a strong working hypothesis: A=S, C=SCl₂, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Using Stoichiometry for Verification.** All solutions correctly use Clue 1 (`solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`) to verify the hypothesis. By identifying the stable allotrope of solid sulfur (A) as S₈ and gas (B) as Cl₂, the balanced reaction `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)` perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometric ratio given in the clue. This provides extremely high confidence in the identities of A, B, and C.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Remaining Compounds.** Using the confirmed identities, the remaining compounds are deduced.\n    *   From Clue 4 (`D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`), `D` is identified as ethene (C₂H₄) and `H` as 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂) via the reaction `C₂H₄ + Cl₂ → C₂H₄Cl₂`.\n    *   From Clue 2 (`When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`), the final product `E` is identified as bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, commonly known as **Mustard Gas**. This is consistent with the description \"extremely hazardous.\"\n\nThere is a unanimous consensus across all candidate answers that **E is Mustard Gas**.\n\n**Part 2: Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThis part involves analyzing the 3D structure of mustard gas to assign its point group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Considering the Most Stable Conformation.** All solutions correctly recognize that the symmetry must be determined for the molecule's lowest-energy, most stable conformation. Due to rotation around single bonds, mustard gas is a flexible molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Eliminating Incorrect Symmetry Groups.** The molecule is correctly identified as non-linear and not square planar, which immediately rules out the high-symmetry groups **D∞h** and **D4h**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Distinguishing Between C2v and C2.** This is the most critical step in the symmetry analysis. All solutions correctly reason that for a molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it must possess two mirror planes. This would force mustard gas into a planar, eclipsed conformation. This conformation is energetically unfavorable due to significant steric hindrance between the two chloroethyl groups. Therefore, the stable conformation lacks mirror planes, and C2v is incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7: Identifying the Correct Symmetry Element.** The stable, non-planar (staggered) conformation of mustard gas possesses only one non-trivial symmetry element: a single two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, all candidate answers correctly conclude that the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously identifies E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂. The symmetry analysis unanimously determines its point group to be **C₂**.

The most robust method is to find a single chemical pathway that consistently satisfies all clues.\n\n*   **Clue 3: `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`**\n    This is the most chemically descriptive clue. A hydrolysis reaction that regenerates the starting solid `A` and produces two different acids (one strong, one weak) is characteristic of the disproportionation of a non-metal halide. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`) is a perfect match:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This allows us to hypothesize:\n    *   **C** = `SCl₂` (Sulfur dichloride)\n    *   **A** = `S` (Elemental Sulfur, a solid)\n    *   **F** = `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n    *   **G** = `H₂SO₃` (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed from SO₂ in water)\n\n*   **Clue 1: `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`**\n    This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check. The stable solid allotrope of sulfur (`A`) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. To form `C` (`SCl₂`), gas `B` must be **Cl₂**. The balanced reaction is:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of `A` (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of `B` (`Cl₂`). This perfect 1:8 ratio, along with the fact that `SCl₂` is a cherry-red liquid (\"bright red product\"), strongly confirms these identities.\n\n*   **Clue 4: `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`**\n    We have identified `B` as `Cl₂`. A common 1:1 gas-phase reaction that forms a solvent is the addition of chlorine to ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This identifies:\n    *   **D** = `C₂H₄` (Ethene)\n    *   **H** = `C₂H₄Cl₂` (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent.\n\n*   **Clue 2: `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`**\n    Using our identified compounds: `C` (`SCl₂`) reacts with 2 equivalents of `D` (`C₂H₄`).\n    `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing **bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide**, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a potent chemical warfare agent, which perfectly fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom with two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry at the sulfur atom. The two chloroethyl groups are flexible due to rotation around single bonds.\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:** We must consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, which rules out **D∞h**.\n    *   It does not have the high degree of symmetry of a square planar molecule, which rules out **D4h**.\n    *   The choice is between **C2v** and **C2**. For a molecule to have C2v symmetry, it must possess two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to adopt a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of mustard gas is non-planar. It possesses only one non-trivial symmetry element: a two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n3.  **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Step 3: Select the Final Answer\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**.

Deconstruction and Analysis of the Clues**\n\nThe puzzle can be solved by finding a single, consistent set of chemical identities that satisfies all four clues. The most specific clues should be used as starting points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Start with the most specific clue.** Clue 3 is the most chemically descriptive.\n    *   **Clue 3:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    *   This describes a hydrolysis reaction where a compound disproportionates, regenerating the starting element (A). This is characteristic of certain non-metal halides. The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a perfect match:\n        `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   This allows us to hypothesize:\n        *   **A** = Sulfur (S), a solid.\n        *   **C** = Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂).\n        *   **F** = Hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid.\n        *   **G** = Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (formed when SO₂ dissolves in water).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Use stoichiometry to verify the hypothesis.** Clue 1 provides a very specific ratio that must be satisfied.\n    *   **Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   Using our hypothesis: A = Sulfur, C = SCl₂. This means B must be Chlorine (Cl₂). SCl₂ is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The stable allotrope of solid sulfur at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B (Cl₂). This perfect match strongly confirms our identifications.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Use the confirmed identities to solve the remaining clues.**\n    *   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   We know B is Chlorine (Cl₂). A common 1:1 addition reaction involving chlorine gas is with an alkene. Let's test ethene:\n        `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    *   This fits perfectly: Gas **D** is Ethene (C₂H₄), and the solvent **H** is 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂).\n\n    *   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   We have C = SCl₂ and D = C₂H₄.\n    *   The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`.\n    *   The product, **(ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**, is the chemical warfare agent **Mustard Gas**. This fits the \"extremely hazardous product\" description.\n\n**2. Determination of the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n\nThe final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of the product E, mustard gas.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyze the 3D structure and conformation.** The molecule is **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n    *   The central sulfur atom has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent geometry at the sulfur atom.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds. We must consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, so **D4h** is incorrect.\n    *   The choice is between **C₂v** and **C₂**. A `C₂v` point group requires the presence of two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. For mustard gas, any conformation with a mirror plane would have high steric strain (e.g., an eclipsed conformation) and would not be the most stable state.\n    *   The lowest-energy conformation of mustard gas is chiral (lacks mirror planes) but possesses a single two-fold axis of rotation (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Assign the correct point group.** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element) is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**3. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is **C₂**. Matching this with the given options:\nA) D∞h\nB) C2v\nC) C2\nD) D4h\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Compounds\n\nThe most effective way to solve this puzzle is to use the most specific chemical clues to form a hypothesis and then verify it with the other clues.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3:** `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`. This hydrolysis reaction, which regenerates the starting solid `A`, is characteristic of a disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride is a classic example that fits this description.\n    *   Let's test the reaction for sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction fits perfectly:\n        *   **C** = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n        *   **A** = S (Elemental sulfur, a solid)\n        *   **F** = HCl (Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid)\n        *   **G** = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid, a weak acid, formed when SO₂ dissolves in water)\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1:** `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C`. This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check.\n    *   The stable allotrope of solid sulfur (`A`) at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Gas `B` must be **Chlorine (Cl₂)** to form the chloride `C`.\n    *   Product `C` is **SCl₂**, which is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas `B` (Cl₂). This perfect match strongly confirms our identifications.\n\n3.  **Identify D and H with Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`.\n    *   We know `B` is chlorine gas (Cl₂). A common 1:1 addition reaction involving chlorine is with an alkene.\n    *   The reaction `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)` fits the description.\n    *   This identifies **D** as **Ethene (C₂H₄)** and **H** as **1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`.\n    *   We have `C = SCl₂` and `D = C₂H₄`.\n    *   The reaction is `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E`.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The product, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, is the chemical warfare agent **Mustard Gas**, which is extremely hazardous. This confirms the identity of **E**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E\n\nThe final task is to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the geometry around it is bent.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** We must consider the most stable, lowest-energy conformation of the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, so **D∞h** is incorrect.\n    *   It does not have the high symmetry of a square planar molecule, so **D4h** is incorrect.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance between the two large chloroethyl groups.\n    *   The most stable conformation of mustard gas is a staggered, non-planar structure. This structure possesses only one non-trivial symmetry element: a **two-fold rotational axis (C₂)** that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides the identity element, E) is a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) C2\nB) D∞h\nC) D4h\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and, ultimately, the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\nHere is a careful, step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Most Descriptive Clue (Clue 3):** The reaction `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` is the most informative starting point. The regeneration of the starting solid `A` suggests a disproportionation reaction. A well-known reaction that fits this pattern is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This hypothesis fits perfectly:\n    *   **A** = **S** (Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   **C** = **SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n    *   **F** = **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G** = **H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid, formed from SO₂ in water), a weak acid.\n\n2.  **Verify with the Stoichiometric Clue (Clue 1):** The reaction `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C` provides a crucial confirmation.\n    *   The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur (A) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   To form C (SCl₂), gas B must be **Cl₂** (Chlorine).\n    *   The product C (SCl₂) is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   Let's check the balanced equation: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of A (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of B (Cl₂). This perfect stoichiometric match strongly validates the hypothesis.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Compounds (Clues 4 and 2):**\n    *   **Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent`. We know B is Cl₂. A common 1:1 reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethene: `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`. The product, 1,2-dichloroethane, is a common solvent. Thus, **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene) and **H = C₂H₄Cl₂**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E`. Substituting our identified compounds: `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) → E`. This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a chemical warfare agent that is extremely hazardous.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (Mustard Gas):**\n    *   The molecule is **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n    *   The geometry around the central sulfur atom is bent due to its two lone pairs of electrons.\n    *   The molecule is not linear (ruling out D∞h) and does not have a highly symmetric square planar shape (ruling out D4h).\n    *   The key distinction is between C2v and C2. For a molecule to have C2v symmetry, it must possess two mirror planes in addition to a C₂ axis. This would require the molecule to adopt a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance.\n    *   The most stable, lowest-energy conformation of mustard gas is a non-planar, staggered structure. This structure lacks any mirror planes but does possess a single two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element (besides identity) is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The chemical puzzle consistently identifies E as mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, which has a molecular symmetry group of C₂.

The regeneration of the starting solid `A` points to a disproportionation reaction. The hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride is a classic example that fits this pattern.\n    *   Hypothesis: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **A** = Sulfur (**S**), a solid.\n        *   **C** = Sulfur dichloride (**SCl₂**).\n        *   **F** = Hydrochloric acid (**HCl**), a strong acid.\n        *   **G** = Sulfurous acid (**H₂SO₃**), a weak acid (formed from SO₂ dissolving in water).\n\n*   **Verifying with Clue 1:** The clue `solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C` provides a crucial stoichiometric check.\n    *   The most stable solid allotrope of sulfur (A) is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**.\n    *   Gas B must be **Chlorine (Cl₂)** to form C (SCl₂).\n    *   The product C, sulfur dichloride, is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red\" description.\n    *   The balanced reaction is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows a perfect 1:8 molar ratio between solid A (S₈) and gas B (Cl₂), which strongly confirms the hypothesis.\n\n*   **Identifying D and H with Clue 4:** The clue `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent` allows us to find the remaining compounds.\n    *   We know B is **Cl₂**.

F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\n    *   This hydrolysis reaction, where the starting solid `A` is regenerated, is characteristic of a disproportionation reaction. A well-known example that fits this pattern is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride.\n    *   Let's test the reaction for sulfur dichloride (SCl₂): `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`.\n    *   This reaction is a perfect match:\n        *   **C** is **SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n        *   **A** is elemental **Sulfur (S)**, a solid.\n        *   **F** is **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n        *   **G** is **H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when the gaseous product SO₂ dissolves in water.\n\n2.  **Verify with the stoichiometric clue (Clue 1):** \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\n    *   This clue provides a crucial check on our hypothesis. The stable solid allotrope of sulfur (`A`) at standard conditions is the crown-shaped ring, **S₈**. Gas `B` must be **Chlorine (Cl₂)** to form `C` (SCl₂).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   This equation shows that 1 mole of solid `A` (S₈) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of gas `B` (Cl₂).

A well-known example that fits this description is the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n    `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4HCl(aq)`\n    This reaction perfectly matches the clue's conditions:\n    *   **A** = **S** (Elemental Sulfur), a solid.\n    *   **C** = **SCl₂** (Sulfur dichloride).\n    *   **F** = **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n    *   **G** = **H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid), a weak acid formed when SO₂ dissolves in water.\n\n2.  **Verify with Clue 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    This clue provides a crucial stoichiometric check. The stable solid form of sulfur (A) is the crown-shaped `S₈` ring. To form `SCl₂` (C), gas B must be `Cl₂`. Let's check the balanced equation:\n    `S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)`\n    This equation shows that 1 mole of `A` (`S₈`) reacts with exactly 8 moles (equivalents) of `B` (`Cl₂`). This perfect 1:8 ratio strongly confirms our hypothesis. Additionally, `SCl₂` is a cherry-red liquid, matching the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n3.  **Identify D and H with Clue 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    We have identified `B` as `Cl₂`. A common 1:1 addition reaction involving chlorine gas is with ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This fits perfectly:\n    *   **D** = **C₂H₄** (Ethene).\n    *   **H** = **C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane), a common solvent.\n\n4.  **Identify E with Clue 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    Substituting our identified compounds:\n    `SCl₂ (C) + 2C₂H₄ (D) → E`\n    This is the well-known Levinstein process for synthesizing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`. This product is commonly known as **Mustard Gas**, a chemical warfare agent that is undeniably an \"extremely hazardous product\".\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E\n\nNow that we have confidently identified **E** as **Mustard Gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**, we must determine its molecular symmetry group (point group).\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to two lone pairs of electrons on the sulfur, the geometry around it is bent.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We must consider the molecule's most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n    *   The molecule is not linear, which rules out **D∞h**.\n    *   It does not have a high-symmetry shape like a square, which rules out **D4h**.\n    *   For the molecule to have **C2v** symmetry, it would require two mirror planes. This would force the molecule into a planar, eclipsed conformation, which is energetically unfavorable due to steric hindrance between the two chloroethyl groups.\n    *   The most stable conformation is a staggered, non-planar structure. This structure's only symmetry element (other than the identity element) is a single two-fold rotational axis (**C₂**) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nA molecule whose only non-trivial symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemical puzzle consistently identifies E as mustard gas. The molecular symmetry group for the stable conformation of mustard gas is **C₂**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
