Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1 and 2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nTo determine the final answer, a systematic analysis of each compound for chirality is required. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key is to check for sources of chirality (like chiral centers or a chiral axis) and the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Analyze `dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate`**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The critical feature to check for is atropisomerism, which arises from restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis**: The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. Analyze `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`**\n*   **Careful Point**: The most common source of chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. Analyze `benzophenone`**\n*   **Careful Point**: Check for elements of symmetry in the overall molecule.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. Analyze `dimethyl fumarate`**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is a *trans*-alkene. Check for elements of symmetry, especially those common to planar molecules.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThe question asks which compounds show optical isomerism. Based on the analysis, the correct answer includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 3 and 4\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is a prerequisite for optical activity. The analysis involves looking for elements of chirality (like chiral centers or chiral axes) and the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is a substituted biphenyl system. The key feature to check for is not a standard chiral carbon, but a phenomenon called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Analysis**: The positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃). The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Careful Point**: The key feature to check for is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Careful Point**: For molecules without an obvious chiral center, it is crucial to check for overall molecular **symmetry**.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is not a chiral center as it is only bonded to three groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Careful Point**: It is important to recognize that this is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, which has specific geometric and symmetry properties.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Reviewing the options:\n*   A) 1 and 2\n*   B) 3 and 4\n*   C) 2 and 3\n*   D) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct option is the one that lists compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n**1.

I will analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus based on correct chemical principles. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key factors to look for are:\n*   **Chirality:** The presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like a chiral axis (atropisomerism).\n*   **Achirality:** The presence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes a molecule superimposable on its mirror image and thus optically inactive.\n\n**2.

There is a strong and unanimous consensus in their chemical analysis, even if their final letter choices vary.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify this as a substituted biphenyl. They all point out that the bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause restricted rotation around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, creates a stable, non-planar, chiral molecule that lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3 (benzophenone):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify that this molecule is achiral. It does not have a chiral center, and it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and possesses both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane) and a **center of inversion**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**3.

The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Careful Point**: The critical feature to check in biphenyls is the potential for restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, occurs when the positions adjacent to the bond (*ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups.\n*   **Conclusion**: In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted with large groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

The most common source of chirality is a chiral center.\n*   **Careful Point**: A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups. We must carefully examine the groups attached to the carbon at position 2.\n*   **Conclusion**: The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. We must check for molecular symmetry.\n*   **Careful Point**: Although it has two large phenyl groups, the molecule is highly symmetric. The central carbon is sp² hybridized and is not a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.

Analysis of `dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate`**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The critical feature to check for is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings, a phenomenon known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Analysis**: The positions adjacent to the connecting bond (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃). This significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. The molecule is locked into a stable, twisted conformation. This twisted shape lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to this axial chirality. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. Analysis of `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`**\n*   **Careful Point**: The most common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. Analysis of `benzophenone`**\n*   **Careful Point**: For molecules without obvious chiral centers, one must carefully check for overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule has no chiral centers. It possesses a clear plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. Analysis of `dimethyl fumarate`**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is a *trans*-alkene, which has a rigid, planar geometry. This geometry often leads to high symmetry.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. This means the plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the unanimous analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is a prerequisite for optical activity. The analysis involves looking for elements of chirality (like chiral centers or chiral axes) and the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is a substituted biphenyl system. The key feature to check for is not a standard chiral carbon, but a phenomenon called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Analysis**: The positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the *ortho* positions: 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃). The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Careful Point**: The key feature to check for is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Careful Point**: For molecules without an obvious chiral center, it is crucial to check for overall molecular **symmetry**.\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is not a chiral center as it is only bonded to three groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Careful Point**: It is important to recognize that this is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, which has specific geometric and symmetry properties.\n*   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

I will analyze the provided candidate answers to find a consensus based on correct chemical principles. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key factors to look for are:\n*   **Chirality:** The presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like a chiral axis (atropisomerism).\n*   **Achirality:** The presence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes a molecule superimposable on its mirror image and thus optically inactive.\n\n**2.

This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, creates a stable, non-planar, chiral molecule that lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3 (benzophenone):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify that this molecule is achiral. It does not have a chiral center, and it possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):**\n    *   **Consensus Reasoning:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is planar and possesses both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane) and a **center of inversion**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**3.
