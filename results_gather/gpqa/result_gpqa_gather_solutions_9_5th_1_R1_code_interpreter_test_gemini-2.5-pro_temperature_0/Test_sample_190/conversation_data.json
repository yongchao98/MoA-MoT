A careful analysis of each step is required to determine the final product. The candidate answers all correctly identify the chemical transformations, indicating a strong consensus on the reaction pathway. The discrepancies in the final letter choice are due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Careful Point:** The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond, forming a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** n-Butyllithium acts as a strong *base*, not a nucleophile. It does not add a butyl group to the molecule. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The NH₄Cl workup simply protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The original ketone functionality is completely removed and replaced with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations.\n*   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is not selective and will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Transformation:** The molecule is fully saturated, and the protecting group is removed.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Now, we match this name to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from misunderstanding the Shapiro reaction and the final deprotection.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.** This name perfectly describes the final product.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, there is a clear and correct consensus on the chemical transformations occurring in each step. The variation in the final letter choice among the candidates is due to the randomization of the option order. The following is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material contains a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong base that reacts with the most acidic proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, protecting the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction that specifically targets the ketone functional group. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** The benzyl ether and alkene functional groups are stable under these acidic condensation conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and then quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize that the strong organometallic reagent n-BuLi acts as a *base*, not a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. A common mistake is to assume it adds a butyl group. The overall transformation replaces the original ketone with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and non-selective reduction step that performs two simultaneous transformations.\n*   **Careful Point:**\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** H₂/Pd-C reduces *all* carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming cyclohexane) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this correct chemical name to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name perfectly matches the structure of the final product.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This describes an intermediate-like structure, not the final product.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from incorrectly assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile and also fails to account for the final deprotection.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem.\n\n### **Plan and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1 (Alcohol Protection):** The starting material has a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene. The reagent is sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base.\n    *   **Careful Point:** I must identify the most acidic proton. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol. The resulting alkoxide will then react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis to protect the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2 (Tosylhydrazone Formation):** The product from step 1 (a ketone) reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond, forming a tosylhydrazone.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3 (Shapiro Reaction):** The tosylhydrazone is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a Shapiro reaction. It is critical to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a strong base, not a nucleophile. It does *not* add a butyl group. It causes the elimination of N₂ and the tosyl group, converting the original ketone position into an alkene. The aqueous workup simply protonates the intermediate.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 4 (Hydrogenation and Deprotection):** The product from step 3 is treated with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Hydrogenation):** H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reducing agent that will saturate *all* carbon-carbon double bonds. This includes the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain, converting them to a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Hydrogenolysis):** H₂/Pd-C is also the standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (a process called hydrogenolysis). This will remove the protecting group from the alcohol, regenerating the original hydroxymethyl group.\n\n5.  **Determine Final Product and Select Option:** By combining all transformations, I will determine the final structure and its chemical name.

Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, protecting the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction is specific to the ketone and does not affect the alkene or the protected benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common error is to mistake the role of n-BuLi. Here, it acts as a strong base, not a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The NH₄Cl workup simply protonates this intermediate. The original ketone is thus completely removed and replaced with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two crucial transformations simultaneously.\n*   **Careful Point:** One must recognize both functions of H₂/Pd-C in this context.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming cyclohexane) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** It cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). This is a standard and expected reaction for this reagent.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is correctly named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options against this correct structure:\n\n*   **A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It results from misunderstanding the Shapiro reaction (assuming n-BuLi adds a butyl group) and failing to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name perfectly matches the structure of the final product.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect. It would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step, which is an incomplete analysis of the reaction's power.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is incorrect. It describes an intermediate-like structure, not the final product of the four-step sequence.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a unanimous and correct consensus on the chemical transformations occurring in each step of the synthesis. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is a result of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The underlying chemical reasoning is sound across all responses.\n\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the correct structure for Product 4.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material contains a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Careful Point:** The most acidic proton is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18), not the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, protecting the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, replacing the C=O bond with a C=N-NHTs bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and then quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Careful Point:** The n-butyllithium acts as a strong base, not a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl simply protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two crucial transformations simultaneously.\n*   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is not selective in this case. It will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds (a process called hydrogenation) and also cleave the benzyl ether protecting group (a process called hydrogenolysis).\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both reduced to single bonds, creating a saturated cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this correct chemical name to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name perfectly matches the structure of the final product.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from incorrectly assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile and also failing to account for the final deprotection. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This describes an intermediate-like structure, not the final product. This is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. A careful analysis of each reaction is required to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4. The analysis confirms the unanimous chemical reasoning presented by all candidate agents.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n    *   **Reaction:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.

This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers.

This structure results from misunderstanding the Shapiro reaction (assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile) and also fails to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   **D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** **This is correct.** This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete four-step reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, there is a unanimous and correct consensus on the chemical transformations occurring in each step of the synthesis. The discrepancies in the final letter choice among the agents are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order. A definitive answer can be reached by performing a careful, independent analysis of the reaction sequence and matching the result to the specific options provided in the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol is now protected as a benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction is specific to the ketone and does not affect the protected alcohol or the alkene.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is critical to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a strong base, not a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The NH₄Cl workup simply protonates this intermediate. An incorrect analysis would assume n-BuLi adds a butyl group to the molecule.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations simultaneously.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard and highly effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). Failing to account for this deprotection is a common error.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is correctly named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this structure to the provided options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is an incorrect intermediate-like structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This is incorrect, resulting from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction and the final deprotection.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name perfectly matches the structure of the final product.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is incorrect. It would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step organic synthesis problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Analysis**: The starting material contains three distinct functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. The reaction begins with the addition of sodium hydride (NaH), a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Acidity)**: The most acidic proton in the molecule is the one on the hydroxyl group of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18), which is significantly more acidic than the protons on the carbon alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   **Transformation**: The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis. This protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether (-OBn), leaving the ketone and alkene functionalities untouched.\n*   **Product 1**: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Analysis**: This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group of Product 1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂).\n*   **Transformation**: The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond, forming a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2**: The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Analysis**: These are the classic conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Role of n-BuLi)**: It is critical to recognize that n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a very strong base, does not act as a nucleophile in this context. It acts as a base, deprotonating the tosylhydrazone twice. This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Transformation**: The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) workup serves to protonate the vinyllithium intermediate. The overall result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality and its replacement with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3**: 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.**\n\n*   **Analysis**: This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Multiple Reductions)**: The reagent H₂/Pd-C is not selective and will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation**: Both carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated to form a cyclohexane ring, and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is saturated to form an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis**: H₂/Pd-C is a standard and highly effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4**: Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Matching this name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This describes an intermediate-like structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This results from misinterpreting the Shapiro reaction and the final hydrogenation.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect.

The reagent is sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base.\n    *   **Careful Point:** I must identify the most acidic proton. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol. The resulting alkoxide will then react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis to protect the alcohol as a benzyl ether.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2 (Tosylhydrazone Formation):** The product from step 1 (a ketone) reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond, forming a tosylhydrazone.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3 (Shapiro Reaction):** The tosylhydrazone is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a Shapiro reaction. It is critical to recognize that n-BuLi acts as a strong base, not a nucleophile. It does *not* add a butyl group. It causes the elimination of N₂ and the tosyl group, converting the original ketone position into an alkene. The aqueous workup simply protonates the intermediate.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 4 (Hydrogenation and Deprotection):** The product from step 3 is treated with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Hydrogenation):** H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reducing agent that will saturate *all* carbon-carbon double bonds. This includes the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain, converting them to a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Hydrogenolysis):** H₂/Pd-C is also the standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (a process called hydrogenolysis).

A careful analysis of each reaction is required to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** n-Butyllithium is a very strong base and does not act as a nucleophile in this reaction. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride workup simply protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality and its replacement with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations.\n*   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is a strong reducing agent that is not selective in this case.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this name to the provided options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This name perfectly describes the final product.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile) and the final hydrogenation step.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule.\n*   **Careful Point:** The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group of Product 1 reacts with the hydrazide.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond, forming a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize that n-BuLi, a very strong base, does not act as a nucleophile in this context. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup simply protonates this intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene, effectively removing the carbonyl oxygen.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations on Product 3.\n*   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is a non-selective reducing agent for the functional groups present.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced (saturated) to single bonds. This affects both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming a cyclohexane ring) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard and highly effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this name to the provided options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect.

It describes an intermediate-like structure, not the final product.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect.

A definitive step-by-step analysis confirms the correct final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Careful Point:** The most acidic proton is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18), not the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, protecting the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone, replacing the C=O double bond with a C=N-NHTs double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Careful Point:** The strong organometallic reagent n-BuLi acts as a *base*, not a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the NH₄Cl workup. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations.\n*   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is a strong reducing agent that is not selective in this case. It will:\n    1.  **Hydrogenate Alkenes:** Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated, forming a cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group, respectively.\n    2.  **Perform Hydrogenolysis:** Cleave the benzyl ether protecting group. This is a standard and expected reaction for this reagent, which regenerates the primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Matching this correct chemical name to the provided options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect.

The variation in the final letter choice among the agents is due to the randomization of the multiple-choice options they received. A definitive answer can be reached by carefully analyzing the reaction sequence step-by-step and matching the final product to the specific list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule contains a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates the most acidic site.\n*   **Careful Point:** The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, protecting the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond.\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction is specific to the ketone and does not affect the alkene or the protected benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common error is to mistake the role of n-BuLi. Here, it acts as a strong base, not a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The NH₄Cl workup simply protonates this intermediate. The original ketone is thus completely removed and replaced with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two crucial transformations simultaneously.\n*   **Careful Point:** One must recognize both functions of H₂/Pd-C in this context.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. This saturates the double bond in the cyclohexene ring (forming cyclohexane) and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (forming an isopropyl group).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** It cleaves the benzyl ether protecting group, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).

Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Careful Point:** The most acidic proton is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18), not the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).

It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl simply protonates this intermediate.

This is an intermediate-like structure.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.** This name perfectly describes the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step organic synthesis problem to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material contains a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.\n*   **Careful Point:** The most acidic proton is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18), which is more acidic than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond. The other functional groups remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize that n-BuLi, a very strong base, acts as a base here, not as a nucleophile. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup simply protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the complete removal of the original ketone functionality.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful and non-selective catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations.\n*   **Careful Point:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for both alkene reduction and benzyl ether cleavage (hydrogenolysis).\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** Both C=C double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this name to the provided options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This results from misunderstanding the Shapiro reaction and the final deprotection.\n*   B) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure, not the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. A careful analysis of each step is required to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Alcohol Protection**\n    *   **Reaction**: The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Analysis**: The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18), rather than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting alkoxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn).\n    *   **Product 1**: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n    *   **Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a standard acid-catalyzed condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond. The other functional groups (benzyl ether, alkene) are unaffected.\n    *   **Product 2**: The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n    *   **Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   **Analysis**: These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. It is critical to recognize that n-BuLi, a very strong base, does not act as a nucleophile in this context. It deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the NH₄Cl workup. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n    *   **Product 3**: 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n    *   **Reaction**: Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations simultaneously:\n        1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation**: All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated to form a cyclohexane ring, and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced to form an isopropyl group.\n        2.  **Hydrogenolysis**: H₂/Pd-C is a standard and highly effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   **Product 4**: Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nMatching this structure to the provided options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure, not the final product.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is an expected reaction under these conditions.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile) and fails to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the provided answers, there is a unanimous and correct consensus on the chemical transformations occurring in each step of the synthesis.
