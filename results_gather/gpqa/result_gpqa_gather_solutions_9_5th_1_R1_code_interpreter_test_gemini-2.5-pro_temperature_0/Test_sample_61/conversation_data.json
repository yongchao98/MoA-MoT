Deconstruct the Starting Material and Final Product**\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Intermediate Identification:** The structure of the final product is a classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (mentally breaking the bond between the α and β carbons), we can identify the key intermediate required for this final step: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Stage 2:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n**3. Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1) and Identify Careful Points**\nThis stage involves transforming `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` into `C₆H₁₁-CHO`, which requires shortening the side chain by one carbon. The most effective method for this is ozonolysis of a specifically prepared alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation**\n    *   **Goal:** To create an internal alkyne that, upon cleavage, will yield the desired aldehyde.\n    *   **Reagents:** The acidic proton of the terminal alkyne is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`), and the resulting acetylide anion is alkylated with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The base must not react with the solvent. Using `NaNH₂` with an acidic solvent like methanol (as in option D) would fail, as the base would be neutralized by the solvent before it could deprotonate the alkyne.\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction**\n    *   **Goal:** To reduce the internal alkyne to an alkene without over-reducing it to an unreactive alkane.\n    *   **Reagents:** A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this selective reduction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Using a strong, unpoisoned catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (as in option C) would be incorrect, as it would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis**\n    *   **Goal:** To cleave the alkene's double bond to form the aldehyde intermediate.\n    *   **Reagents:** The alkene is treated with ozone (`O₃`), followed by a reductive workup.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The workup step is critical. A **reductive workup** using a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is necessary to produce the aldehyde. An **oxidative workup** using `H₂O` (as in option B) would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the final aldol reaction.\n\n**4. Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n*   **Goal:** To catalyze the self-condensation of two cyclohexanecarbaldehyde molecules.\n*   **Reagents:** A base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), is used to deprotonate the α-carbon of one aldehyde molecule, allowing it to attack a second molecule to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the correct pathway and careful points established above, we can evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway: Alkylation → Partial Reduction → Reductive Ozonolysis → Aldol Addition. **This is the correct sequence.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` is oxidative and would produce a carboxylic acid, not the required aldehyde.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The `H₂/Pd` catalyst would over-reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, a detailed step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Identify the Intermediate:** A retrosynthetic analysis of the final product shows that it is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThis transformation requires changing the functional group and shortening the carbon side-chain from two carbons (`-C≡CH`) to one (`-CHO`). This necessitates a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a C=C double bond to form carbonyl compounds. The strategy is therefore to convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene and then cleave it.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To obtain cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon cleavage, the alkene precursor should be `C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`. To create this, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively producing a *cis*-alkene. Using a stronger catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would lead to an alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** is essential. Dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is a standard reagent for this purpose. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would be incorrect as it would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction**\n\nThe cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition. A suitable base like **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)** is used to generate the enolate, which then attacks a second molecule of the aldehyde to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nBased on the correct four-step pathway established above, we can evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent, preventing the desired deprotonation of the alkyne. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride... 3. O3/ H2O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`) for the ozonolysis. This would produce a carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, a strong, unpoisoned catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane, making subsequent steps impossible. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway. Each step employs the correct reagents for the required transformation: alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis to the aldehyde intermediate, and a base-catalyzed aldol reaction. **This sequence is correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product to Determine the Overall Strategy**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (working backward from the product), we can identify the molecule that undergoes the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n*   **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, this intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed aldol reaction with itself to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThis stage involves converting ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires shortening the side chain from two carbons to one. A standard method for cleaving carbon-carbon bonds to form carbonyls is ozonolysis, which acts on alkenes. Therefore, the strategy is: Alkyne → Alkene → Aldehyde.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.

Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to first create this intermediate.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThe conversion of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) involves shortening the side chain from two carbons to one. This requires a reaction that cleaves a carbon-carbon bond. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, but it requires an alkene precursor.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne.

The overall synthesis must first produce this intermediate from the starting material.\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe process can be broken down into two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Synthesis of the Intermediate.** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This requires changing the functional group and shortening the carbon side-chain from two carbons to one.\n*   **Stage 2: Aldol Addition.** Use a base to catalyze the self-condensation of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Necessary Chemical Steps and Careful Points**\n\n**Stage 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis transformation requires several steps. The goal is to cleave the side chain to leave a single-carbon aldehyde group. Ozonolysis is the ideal reaction for this cleavage, but it requires an alkene precursor.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, the terminal alkyne must be converted into a specific internal alkyne.

This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is required for this selective reduction.

The most effective method for this is the ozonolysis of a specifically prepared alkene.\n\n*   **Sub-step 1: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Sub-step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively producing a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Sub-step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** with a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is essential.\n\n### **Step 4: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\nThe cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base, such as barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options and Identify Careful Points**\n\nBased on the correct pathway established above, we can evaluate the options provided.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Step 2 is incorrect. `H₂/Pd` is a strong, unpoisoned catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Step 1 is incorrect. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base that would react with the acidic proton of the methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction, rather than performing the intended deprotonation of the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Step 3 is incorrect. The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) is oxidative, which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway. Each reagent is correct for the intended transformation: 1. Alkylation, 2. Partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, 3. Reductive ozonolysis, and 4. Base-catalyzed aldol addition.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the correct chemical logic, even though their final letter choices vary (likely due to scrambled options in the original prompts they received). The only chemically viable pathway presented in the question's options is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the overall transformation step-by-step, paying close attention to the function of each reagent and the potential for incorrect side reactions or products.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal: Starting Material to Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). A key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** The final product's structure is the classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. This means the synthesis must first produce an aldehyde intermediate, which then reacts with itself in a second stage. By performing a retrosynthesis on the final product, we can identify this key intermediate as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Formulate the Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe overall process can be divided into two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n*   **Stage 2:** Induce the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### Careful Points for Each Transformation\n\n**Stage 1: Synthesis of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis stage requires shortening the two-carbon side chain to a one-carbon aldehyde group. This C-C bond cleavage is best achieved by ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Creating the Correct Alkene.** To get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ozonolysis, we must first create the alkene 1-cyclohexylpropene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`). This is done by first converting the starting terminal alkyne to the internal alkyne 1-cyclohexylpropyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 1 (Alkylation):** The acidic proton of ethynylcyclohexane is removed by a strong base, **`NaNH₂`** (sodium amide). The resulting acetylide anion is then alkylated with **`CH₃Cl`** (methyl chloride) to add the necessary methyl group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction of the Alkyne.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical *not* to reduce it all the way to an alkane, which would be unreactive to ozonolysis.\n    *   **Step 2 (Reduction):** A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required for this selective transformation. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent to stop the reduction at the alkene stage. Using a more active catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would lead to complete reduction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct Ozonolysis Workup.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). The resulting ozonide must be worked up correctly to yield the desired aldehyde.\n    *   **Step 3 (Ozonolysis):** A **reductive workup** is essential to produce the aldehyde. **Dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** is a standard reagent for this. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would be incorrect as it would produce a carboxylic acid (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n**Stage 2: The Aldol Reaction**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Catalyzing the Aldol Addition.** The self-condensation of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is catalyzed by a base.\n    *   **Step 4 (Aldol Addition):** A suitable base like **`Ba(OH)₂`** (barium hydroxide) is used to generate the enolate from one molecule of the aldehyde, which then attacks a second molecule to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nBased on these careful points, we can evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which is too strong and would over-reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane (violates Careful Point 2).\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is incorrect. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`H₂O`), which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the required aldehyde (violates Careful Point 3).\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Correct:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway established above. Each step uses the correct reagents to achieve the desired transformation without producing incorrect intermediates or side products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product step-by-step, paying close attention to the function of each reagent.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Transformation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** The structure of the final product is a classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. This means the synthesis must first create an aldehyde intermediate, which then reacts with itself in the presence of a base.\n*   **Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (mentally breaking the bond formed in the aldol reaction), we can identify the necessary intermediate as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Overall Synthetic Strategy**\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Synthesis and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Creating the Aldehyde Intermediate.** The conversion of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) involves shortening the side chain by one carbon. The most effective method for this is ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, the alkyne must first be converted into a suitable alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, the terminal alkyne must be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by removing the acidic terminal proton with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n    *   *Incorrect Reagents:* Using methanol (`CH₃OH`) with `NaNH₂` (Option D) would fail because the strong base would react with the acidic solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to stop the reaction at the alkene stage.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Choice of Catalyst.** A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is required to selectively stop the reduction at the alkene. Using a stronger, unpoisoned catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (Option C) would over-reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Choice of Workup.** To obtain the desired aldehyde product, a **reductive workup** with a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. An oxidative workup, such as with water (`H₂O`) alone (Option A), would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition. A base like barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is suitable for this transformation.\n\n**4. Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these careful points:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` is oxidative and would produce a carboxylic acid, not the required aldehyde.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Correct.** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway: 1. Alkylation, 2.

H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The `H₂/Pd` catalyst in step 2 is too strong and would over-reduce the alkyne to an alkane.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** In step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only one sequence of reagents is chemically viable.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify the key reaction.** The structure of the final product is a classic signature of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. This means the final step of the synthesis involves two molecules of an aldehyde intermediate reacting with each other in the presence of a base.\n*   **Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthesis (mentally breaking the bond formed in the aldol reaction), we can identify the necessary intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Stage 2: Aldol Reaction.** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThis stage requires converting `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` to `C₆H₁₁-CHO`. This involves shortening the side chain by one carbon.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Choose the right C-C cleavage reaction.** Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a carbon-carbon double bond to form carbonyl compounds. Therefore, the strategy is to convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene and then cleave it.\n\nThe detailed steps for Stage 1 are:\n1.  **Alkylation:** To set up the correct cleavage point, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic terminal proton with a strong base like **sodium amide (`NaNH₂`)** and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Avoid over-reduction.** It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage and not proceed to an unreactive alkane. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this specific transformation. Using a more powerful catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would produce an alkane.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Use a reductive workup.** To obtain the desired aldehyde product, a **reductive workup** is essential. A reagent like **dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** achieves this.

This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (working backward from the product), we can identify the molecule that undergoes the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to first create this intermediate.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two major stages:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThis stage involves converting ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires shortening the side chain from two carbons to one, which points to a carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, but it requires an alkene precursor.\n\n*   **Sub-step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne.

By mentally reversing this step, we can see that the final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must therefore proceed in two main stages:\n        *   **Stage 1:** Synthesize the intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane.\n        *   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on the intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Stage 1: Synthesis of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis stage requires converting the two-carbon alkyne side chain (`-C≡CH`) into a one-carbon aldehyde group (`-CHO`). This involves cleaving a carbon-carbon bond. The standard method for this is ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point, the terminal alkyne must be converted to an internal alkyne.\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotonate the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base, then add a methyl group.\n    *   **Reagents:** `NaNH₂` (strong base) followed by `CH₃Cl` (methyl chloride).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Compatibility.** The base (`NaNH₂`) is extremely strong and will react with any acidic protons available. Using a protic solvent like methanol (as in option D) would cause an acid-base reaction with the solvent, preventing the desired reaction with the alkyne. Using the wrong alkylating agent like ethyl chloride (as in option C) would lead to the wrong final product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`) must be reduced to an alkene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Catalyst Selectivity.** The reduction must stop at the alkene stage.

By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (mentally reversing the aldol reaction), we can identify this key intermediate as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two main stages:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** The primary goal is to convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** The intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, must then undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThe conversion of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) involves shortening the side chain from two carbons to one. This requires a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, but it requires an alkene as a starting material. Therefore, the strategy is to first convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene.\n\n*   **Sub-step 3a: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like **sodium amide (`NaNH₂`)** and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Sub-step 3b: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively producing a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Sub-step 3c: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** with a reagent like **dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** is essential.\n\n### **Step 4: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\nThe cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base, such as **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)**, to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options and Identify Careful Points**\n\nBased on the correct four-step pathway established above, we can now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`), which would produce a carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, a strong, unpoisoned catalyst that would fully reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, making subsequent steps impossible. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Step 1 is invalid. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent in an acid-base reaction instead of deprotonating the alkyne. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly matches the derived plan. It correctly performs alkylation (Step 1), partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst (Step 2), reductive ozonolysis to the aldehyde intermediate (Step 3), and a base-catalyzed aldol reaction (Step 4). **This sequence is chemically correct.**\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the correct chemical logic, even though their final letter choices vary (likely due to scrambled options in their prompts). The only chemically viable pathway presented in the question's options is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, a comprehensive step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Identify the Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (mentally working backward from the product), we can identify the precursor for the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to first create this aldehyde intermediate from the starting material.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This involves changing the functional group and shortening the carbon side-chain from two carbons to one.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThis stage requires a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a C=C double bond to form carbonyl compounds. The strategy is therefore to convert the alkyne into a specific alkene and then cleave it.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To obtain cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon cleavage, the alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne with a methyl group on one side (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`). This is achieved by first deprotonating the terminal alkyne with a strong base like **sodium amide (`NaNH₂`)**. The resulting acetylide anion is then reacted with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to stop the reaction at the alkene stage and not proceed to an unreactive alkane. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this specific transformation, as it selectively stops the reduction at the alkene. Using a more powerful catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would produce an alkane.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** is essential. **Dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** is a standard reagent for this purpose. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O`) would be incorrect as it would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n### **Step 4: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Base-Catalyzed Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate undergoes a self-condensation reaction. This is catalyzed by a base, such as **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)**, which is strong enough to form the necessary enolate to initiate the reaction and form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nBased on the correct four-step pathway established above, we can evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is incorrect. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride... 3. O3/ H2O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is incorrect. The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) is oxidative, which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 is incorrect. `H₂/Pd` is a strong, unpoisoned catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Correctness:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway. Each step employs the correct reagents for the required transformation: alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis, and a base-catalyzed aldol addition.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The proton on the terminal carbon is acidic and can be removed by a strong base.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name, while potentially ambiguous, describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n    *   **Key Intermediate:** To form the final product via an aldol reaction, two molecules of an aldehyde intermediate must react. Through retrosynthesis, this intermediate is identified as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n    The synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n    *   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This involves changing the functional group and shortening the side chain by one carbon.\n    *   **Stage 2:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n3.  **Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n    The conversion of `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` to `C₆H₁₁-CHO` requires cleaving a carbon-carbon bond. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, which requires an alkene as a precursor.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct aldehyde, the terminal alkyne is first converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage.\n    *   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`) to form the aldehyde.\n\n4.  **Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-condensation reaction, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n### Careful Points and Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on this plan, we can identify several critical points and evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Catalyst for Alkyne Reduction.** The reduction of the alkyne must stop at the alkene. A standard catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (used in option A) is too strong and would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is required for this selective transformation. Option **D** correctly uses this catalyst.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Compatibility.** A strong base like `NaNH₂` cannot be used with a protic solvent like methanol (used in option B). The base would react with the solvent in a simple acid-base reaction instead of deprotonating the alkyne. Option **B** is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Ozonolysis Workup.** To obtain an aldehyde from ozonolysis, a **reductive workup** (e.g., with `(CH₃)₂S` or `Zn/H₂O`) is essential. An oxidative workup, such as with `H₂O` alone (used in option C), would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the subsequent aldol reaction. Option **C** is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Aldol Catalyst.** A suitable base is needed to catalyze the aldol reaction. Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), as used in option D, is a strong base appropriate for this step.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly one sequence correctly navigates all the chemical requirements:\n\n*   **A)** Fails due to over-reduction of the alkyne.\n*   **B)** Fails due to an incompatible base/solvent combination in the first step.\n*   **C)** Fails due to an incorrect (oxidative) workup for the ozonolysis step.\n*   **D)** Correctly uses alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis to form the aldehyde intermediate, and a base-catalyzed aldol reaction to form the final product.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, a comprehensive step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation is necessary.\n\n### **Analysis of the Overall Transformation**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon.\n2.  **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a self-**aldol addition reaction**.\n3.  **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (working backward from the product), we can identify the molecule that undergoes the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n4.  **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, this intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed aldol reaction with itself to form the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis Plan and Careful Points**\n\nThe synthesis can be broken down into four critical steps.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Creating the Correct Carbon Skeleton (Step 1: Alkylation)**\n    The starting material has a two-carbon side chain (`-C≡CH`), while the aldehyde intermediate has a one-carbon side chain (`-CHO`). This means a carbon atom must be cleaved off. A standard method for this is ozonolysis of an alkene. To set up the correct alkene for cleavage, the terminal alkyne is first converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating with a strong base like **sodium amide (NaNH₂)** and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **methyl chloride (CH₃Cl)**. This creates 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne, which has the correct structure (`Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`) for the subsequent steps.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* Using a strong base like `NaNH₂` with a protic solvent like methanol (Option B) would cause an acid-base reaction, destroying the reagent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Forming the Alkene Precursor (Step 2: Partial Reduction)**\n    The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst. **Lindlar's catalyst (H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* Using a strong, unpoisoned catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (Option D) would over-reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Cleaving to the Aldehyde (Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis)**\n    The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** is essential. **Dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S)** is a standard reagent for this, ensuring the product is an aldehyde.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* An oxidative workup, such as with water (`H₂O`) for an internal alkene (Option C), would produce a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) instead of an aldehyde. A carboxylic acid cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Final Aldol Reaction (Step 4: Base Catalysis)**\n    The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate undergoes a self-condensation reaction. This is catalyzed by a base, such as **barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂)**, which is strong enough to generate the enolate required for the reaction.\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on these careful points, we can evaluate the given sequences:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway derived above.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Goal: Starting Material to Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). A key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** The final product's structure is the classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.

Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe overall process can be divided into two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n*   **Stage 2:** Induce the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde using a base to form the final product.\n\n### **3. Careful Points for Each Transformation**\n\n**Stage 1: Synthesis of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis stage requires shortening the two-carbon side chain to a one-carbon aldehyde group. This C-C bond cleavage is best achieved by ozonolysis of an alkene. Therefore, the strategy is: **Alkyne → Alkene → Aldehyde**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation (Step 1).** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, we must first convert the terminal alkyne to an internal alkyne. This is done by removing the acidic proton with a strong base (**`NaNH₂`**) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **`CH₃Cl`** (methyl chloride) to add a single carbon.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* Using a protic solvent like methanol (Option D) would cause the `NaNH₂` to react with the solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction (Step 2).** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene.

This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Intermediate Identification:** The structure of the final product is a classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (mentally breaking the bond between the α and β carbons), we can identify the key intermediate required for this final step: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Stage 2:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n**3. Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1) and Identify Careful Points**\nThis stage involves transforming `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` into `C₆H₁₁-CHO`, which requires shortening the side chain by one carbon. The most effective method for this is ozonolysis of a specifically prepared alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation**\n    *   **Goal:** To create an internal alkyne that, upon cleavage, will yield the desired aldehyde.\n    *   **Reagents:** The acidic proton of the terminal alkyne is removed by a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`), and the resulting acetylide anion is alkylated with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The base must not react with the solvent. Using `NaNH₂` with an acidic solvent like methanol (as in option D) would fail, as the base would be neutralized by the solvent before it could deprotonate the alkyne.\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction**\n    *   **Goal:** To reduce the internal alkyne to an alkene without over-reducing it to an unreactive alkane.\n    *   **Reagents:** A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this selective reduction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Using a strong, unpoisoned catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (as in option C) would be incorrect, as it would reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis**\n    *   **Goal:** To cleave the alkene's double bond to form the aldehyde intermediate.\n    *   **Reagents:** The alkene is treated with ozone (`O₃`), followed by a reductive workup.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The workup step is critical. A **reductive workup** using a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is necessary to produce the aldehyde. An **oxidative workup** using `H₂O` (as in option B) would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the final aldol reaction.\n\n**4.

NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, a detailed step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Identify the Intermediate:** A retrosynthetic analysis of the final product shows that it is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 2: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThis transformation requires changing the functional group and shortening the carbon side-chain from two carbons (`-C≡CH`) to one (`-CHO`). This necessitates a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a C=C double bond to form carbonyl compounds. The strategy is therefore to convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene and then cleave it.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To obtain cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon cleavage, the alkene precursor should be `C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`. To create this, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is achieved by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively producing a *cis*-alkene. Using a stronger catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would lead to an alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** is essential. Dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is a standard reagent for this purpose. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would be incorrect as it would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction**\n\nThe cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition. A suitable base like **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)** is used to generate the enolate, which then attacks a second molecule of the aldehyde to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nBased on the correct four-step pathway established above, we can evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** In Step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent, preventing the desired deprotonation of the alkyne. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride... 3. O3/ H2O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O`) for the ozonolysis. This would produce a carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, a strong, unpoisoned catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane, making subsequent steps impossible. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway. Each step employs the correct reagents for the required transformation: alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis to the aldehyde intermediate, and a base-catalyzed aldol reaction. **This sequence is correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product to Determine the Overall Strategy**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (working backward from the product), we can identify the molecule that undergoes the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n*   **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, this intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed aldol reaction with itself to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThis stage involves converting ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires shortening the side chain from two carbons to one. A standard method for cleaving carbon-carbon bonds to form carbonyls is ozonolysis, which acts on alkenes. Therefore, the strategy is: Alkyne → Alkene → Aldehyde.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.

Deconstruction of the Chemical Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde.

The overall synthesis must first produce this intermediate from the starting material.\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe process can be broken down into two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Synthesis of the Intermediate.** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Analysis of the Necessary Chemical Steps and Careful Points**\n\n**Stage 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis transformation requires several steps. The goal is to cleave the side chain to leave a single-carbon aldehyde group. Ozonolysis is the ideal reaction for this cleavage, but it requires an alkene precursor.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, the terminal alkyne must be converted into a specific internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is required for this selective reduction. A stronger catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (as in option C) would incorrectly reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** with a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is essential.

The most effective method for this is the ozonolysis of a specifically prepared alkene.\n\n*   **Sub-step 1: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Sub-step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane.

Deconstruct the Goal: Starting Material to Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). A key feature is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** The final product's structure is the classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. This means the synthesis must first produce an aldehyde intermediate, which then reacts with itself in a second stage. By performing a retrosynthesis on the final product, we can identify this key intermediate as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Formulate the Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe overall process can be divided into two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n*   **Stage 2:** Induce the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n### Careful Points for Each Transformation\n\n**Stage 1: Synthesis of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis stage requires shortening the two-carbon side chain to a one-carbon aldehyde group. This C-C bond cleavage is best achieved by ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Creating the Correct Alkene.** To get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ozonolysis, we must first create the alkene 1-cyclohexylpropene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`). This is done by first converting the starting terminal alkyne to the internal alkyne 1-cyclohexylpropyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 1 (Alkylation):** The acidic proton of ethynylcyclohexane is removed by a strong base, **`NaNH₂`** (sodium amide). The resulting acetylide anion is then alkylated with **`CH₃Cl`** (methyl chloride) to add the necessary methyl group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction of the Alkyne.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical *not* to reduce it all the way to an alkane, which would be unreactive to ozonolysis.\n    *   **Step 2 (Reduction):** A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required for this selective transformation. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent to stop the reduction at the alkene stage. Using a more active catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would lead to complete reduction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Correct Ozonolysis Workup.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). The resulting ozonide must be worked up correctly to yield the desired aldehyde.\n    *   **Step 3 (Ozonolysis):** A **reductive workup** is essential to produce the aldehyde. **Dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** is a standard reagent for this. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would be incorrect as it would produce a carboxylic acid (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n**Stage 2: The Aldol Reaction**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Catalyzing the Aldol Addition.** The self-condensation of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is catalyzed by a base.\n    *   **Step 4 (Aldol Addition):** A suitable base like **`Ba(OH)₂`** (barium hydroxide) is used to generate the enolate from one molecule of the aldehyde, which then attacks a second molecule to form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\nBased on these careful points, we can evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which is too strong and would over-reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane (violates Careful Point 2).\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is incorrect. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`H₂O`), which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the required aldehyde (violates Careful Point 3).\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Correct:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway established above. Each step uses the correct reagents to achieve the desired transformation without producing incorrect intermediates or side products.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product step-by-step, paying close attention to the function of each reagent.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Transformation**\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This structure is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Key Insight:** The structure of the final product is a classic result of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. This means the synthesis must first create an aldehyde intermediate, which then reacts with itself in the presence of a base.\n*   **Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (mentally breaking the bond formed in the aldol reaction), we can identify the necessary intermediate as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n**2. Overall Synthetic Strategy**\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n*   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Synthesis and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Creating the Aldehyde Intermediate.** The conversion of ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) involves shortening the side chain by one carbon. The most effective method for this is ozonolysis, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, the alkyne must first be converted into a suitable alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, the terminal alkyne must be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by removing the acidic terminal proton with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n    *   *Incorrect Reagents:* Using methanol (`CH₃OH`) with `NaNH₂` (Option D) would fail because the strong base would react with the acidic solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to stop the reaction at the alkene stage.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Choice of Catalyst.** A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is required to selectively stop the reduction at the alkene. Using a stronger, unpoisoned catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (Option C) would over-reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Choice of Workup.** To obtain the desired aldehyde product, a **reductive workup** with a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) is essential. An oxidative workup, such as with water (`H₂O`) alone (Option A), would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the final aldol reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition. A base like barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is suitable for this transformation.\n\n**4. Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these careful points:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` is oxidative and would produce a carboxylic acid, not the required aldehyde.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Correct.** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway: 1. Alkylation, 2. Partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, 3. Reductive ozonolysis to the aldehyde, and 4. Base-catalyzed aldol addition.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Incorrect.** The `H₂/Pd` catalyst in step 2 is too strong and would over-reduce the alkyne to an alkane.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Incorrect.** In step 1, the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only one sequence of reagents is chemically viable.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify the key reaction.** The structure of the final product is a classic signature of a **self-aldol addition reaction**. This means the final step of the synthesis involves two molecules of an aldehyde intermediate reacting with each other in the presence of a base.\n*   **Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthesis (mentally breaking the bond formed in the aldol reaction), we can identify the necessary intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two main stages:\n1.  **Stage 1: Intermediate Synthesis.** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Stage 2: Aldol Reaction.** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThis stage requires converting `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` to `C₆H₁₁-CHO`. This involves shortening the side chain by one carbon.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Choose the right C-C cleavage reaction.** Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a carbon-carbon double bond to form carbonyl compounds. Therefore, the strategy is to convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene and then cleave it.\n\nThe detailed steps for Stage 1 are:\n1.  **Alkylation:** To set up the correct cleavage point, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic terminal proton with a strong base like **sodium amide (`NaNH₂`)** and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Avoid over-reduction.** It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage and not proceed to an unreactive alkane. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this specific transformation. Using a more powerful catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would produce an alkane.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Use a reductive workup.** To obtain the desired aldehyde product, a **reductive workup** is essential. A reagent like **dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** achieves this. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`) would incorrectly produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n### **Step 4: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Select a suitable base.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition. A base such as **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)** is effective for this transformation.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this chemically sound, multi-step pathway.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is incorrect. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2.

The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) is oxidative, which would produce a carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only one option provides a complete and chemically viable pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents for the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the terminal alkyne, which has an acidic proton.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (working backward from the product), we can identify the molecule that undergoes the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to first create this intermediate.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two major stages:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThis stage involves converting ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires shortening the side chain from two carbons to one, which points to a carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, but it requires an alkene precursor.\n\n*   **Sub-step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point for ozonolysis, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Sub-step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to stop the reaction at the alkene stage and not proceed to an unreactive alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively producing a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Sub-step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** with a reagent like **dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** is essential. This step cleaves the alkene to yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n\n### **Step 4: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\nThe cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base, such as **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)**, to catalyze the self-aldol addition reaction, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options and Identify Careful Points**\n\nBased on the correct four-step pathway established above, we can evaluate the given options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation Reagent.** The alkylating agent must be methyl chloride to add only one carbon. Option A uses ethyl chloride, which is incorrect.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Solvent Compatibility.** A strong base like `NaNH₂` cannot be used with a protic solvent like methanol (Option D), as they would react in an acid-base reaction.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reduction Catalyst.** The reduction of the alkyne must be stopped at the alkene. Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-CaCO₃`) is required. A stronger catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (Option C) would over-reduce the alkyne to an alkane, making the synthesis fail.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Ozonolysis Workup.** A reductive workup (e.g., `(CH₃)₂S`) is needed to produce the aldehyde. An oxidative workup (`O₃/H₂O` as in Option A) would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\nNow, let's check the options against these points:\n\n*   **A) 1.

By mentally reversing this step, we can see that the final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must therefore proceed in two main stages:\n        *   **Stage 1:** Synthesize the intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane.\n        *   **Stage 2:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition on the intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Stage 1: Synthesis of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThis stage requires converting the two-carbon alkyne side chain (`-C≡CH`) into a one-carbon aldehyde group (`-CHO`). This involves cleaving a carbon-carbon bond. The standard method for this is ozonolysis of an alkene.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To set up the correct cleavage point, the terminal alkyne must be converted to an internal alkyne.\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotonate the acidic alkyne proton with a strong base, then add a methyl group.\n    *   **Reagents:** `NaNH₂` (strong base) followed by `CH₃Cl` (methyl chloride).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Compatibility.** The base (`NaNH₂`) is extremely strong and will react with any acidic protons available. Using a protic solvent like methanol (as in option D) would cause an acid-base reaction with the solvent, preventing the desired reaction with the alkyne. Using the wrong alkylating agent like ethyl chloride (as in option C) would lead to the wrong final product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`) must be reduced to an alkene (`C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Catalyst Selectivity.** The reduction must stop at the alkene stage. A standard hydrogenation catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (as in option B) is too reactive and would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis. A \"poisoned\" catalyst is required.\n    *   **Reagents:** **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard choice for selectively reducing an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved to form the aldehyde.\n    *   **Reaction:** Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a workup.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Workup Conditions.** The workup must be reductive to yield an aldehyde. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O` or `H₂O₂`, as in option C) would produce a carboxylic acid (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n    *   **Reagents:** `O₃` followed by a reductive workup agent like **dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)**.\n\n### **Stage 2: Aldol Addition**\n\n*   **Step 4: Base-Catalyzed Condensation.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate reacts with itself in the presence of a base.\n    *   **Reagents:** A suitable base like **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)** or sodium hydroxide (`NaOH`) is used to generate the enolate and catalyze the reaction.\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe correct, chemically sound sequence is:\n1.  `NaNH₂`, `CH₃Cl`\n2.  `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`\n3.  `O₃` / `(CH₃)₂S`\n4.  `Ba(OH)₂`\n\nComparing this to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 1.

This requires a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, but it requires an alkene as a starting material. Therefore, the strategy is to first convert the alkyne into a suitable alkene.\n\n*   **Sub-step 3a: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct product, the terminal alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating the acidic alkyne with a strong base like **sodium amide (`NaNH₂`)** and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**. This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne.\n*   **Sub-step 3b: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to prevent over-reduction to an unreactive alkane. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively producing a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Sub-step 3c: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`).

The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). Therefore, the primary goal of the synthesis is to first create this aldehyde intermediate from the starting material.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This involves changing the functional group and shortening the carbon side-chain from two carbons to one.\n2.  **Final Aldol Reaction:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n\nThis stage requires a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the standard method for cleaving a C=C double bond to form carbonyl compounds. The strategy is therefore to convert the alkyne into a specific alkene and then cleave it.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Alkylation.** To obtain cyclohexanecarbaldehyde upon cleavage, the alkyne must first be converted to an internal alkyne with a methyl group on one side (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`). This is achieved by first deprotonating the terminal alkyne with a strong base like **sodium amide (`NaNH₂`)**. The resulting acetylide anion is then reacted with **methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`)**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is critical to stop the reaction at the alkene stage and not proceed to an unreactive alkane. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst. **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is the standard reagent for this specific transformation, as it selectively stops the reduction at the alkene. Using a more powerful catalyst like `H₂/Pd` would be incorrect as it would produce an alkane.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** is essential. **Dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`)** is a standard reagent for this purpose. An oxidative workup (e.g., with `H₂O`) would be incorrect as it would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n### **Step 4: Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Base-Catalyzed Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate undergoes a self-condensation reaction. This is catalyzed by a base, such as **barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`)**, which is strong enough to form the necessary enolate to initiate the reaction and form the final β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nBased on the correct four-step pathway established above, we can evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is incorrect. The strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the acidic methanol solvent instead of the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride... 3. O3/ H2O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is incorrect. The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) is oxidative, which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the aldehyde required for the final aldol reaction.\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 is incorrect. `H₂/Pd` is a strong, unpoisoned catalyst that would reduce the alkyne completely to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Correctness:** This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway. Each step employs the correct reagents for the required transformation: alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis, and a base-catalyzed aldol addition.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). The proton on the terminal carbon is acidic and can be removed by a strong base.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name, while potentially ambiguous, describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition reaction**.\n    *   **Key Intermediate:** To form the final product via an aldol reaction, two molecules of an aldehyde intermediate must react. Through retrosynthesis, this intermediate is identified as **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n    The synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n    *   **Stage 1:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This involves changing the functional group and shortening the side chain by one carbon.\n    *   **Stage 2:** Use a base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\n3.  **Plan the Synthesis of the Intermediate (Stage 1)**\n    The conversion of `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH` to `C₆H₁₁-CHO` requires cleaving a carbon-carbon bond. Ozonolysis is the standard method for this, which requires an alkene as a precursor.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To create an alkene that will cleave to the correct aldehyde, the terminal alkyne is first converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating with a strong base like sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) and then reacting the resulting acetylide with methyl chloride (`CH₃Cl`). This forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (`C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage.\n    *   **Step 3: Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved with ozone (`O₃`) to form the aldehyde.\n\n4.  **Plan the Final Aldol Reaction (Stage 2)**\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate is treated with a base to catalyze the self-condensation reaction, forming the final β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n\n### Careful Points and Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on this plan, we can identify several critical points and evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Catalyst for Alkyne Reduction.** The reduction of the alkyne must stop at the alkene. A standard catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (used in option A) is too strong and would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like **Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`)** is required for this selective transformation. Option **D** correctly uses this catalyst.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Compatibility.** A strong base like `NaNH₂` cannot be used with a protic solvent like methanol (used in option B). The base would react with the solvent in a simple acid-base reaction instead of deprotonating the alkyne. Option **B** is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Ozonolysis Workup.** To obtain an aldehyde from ozonolysis, a **reductive workup** (e.g., with `(CH₃)₂S` or `Zn/H₂O`) is essential. An oxidative workup, such as with `H₂O` alone (used in option C), would produce a carboxylic acid, which cannot undergo the subsequent aldol reaction. Option **C** is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Aldol Catalyst.** A suitable base is needed to catalyze the aldol reaction. Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`), as used in option D, is a strong base appropriate for this step.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly one sequence correctly navigates all the chemical requirements:\n\n*   **A)** Fails due to over-reduction of the alkyne.\n*   **B)** Fails due to an incompatible base/solvent combination in the first step.\n*   **C)** Fails due to an incorrect (oxidative) workup for the ozonolysis step.\n*   **D)** Correctly uses alkylation, partial reduction with Lindlar's catalyst, reductive ozonolysis to form the aldehyde intermediate, and a base-catalyzed aldol reaction to form the final product.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reagents, a comprehensive step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation is necessary.\n\n### **Analysis of the Overall Transformation**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). The key reactive site is the acidic proton on the terminal carbon.\n2.  **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a β-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic product of a self-**aldol addition reaction**.\n3.  **Key Intermediate:** By performing a retrosynthetic analysis (working backward from the product), we can identify the molecule that undergoes the aldol reaction. The final product is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n4.  **Overall Strategy:** The synthesis must first convert ethynylcyclohexane into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, this intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed aldol reaction with itself to form the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Synthesis Plan and Careful Points**\n\nThe synthesis can be broken down into four critical steps.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Creating the Correct Carbon Skeleton (Step 1: Alkylation)**\n    The starting material has a two-carbon side chain (`-C≡CH`), while the aldehyde intermediate has a one-carbon side chain (`-CHO`). This means a carbon atom must be cleaved off. A standard method for this is ozonolysis of an alkene. To set up the correct alkene for cleavage, the terminal alkyne is first converted to an internal alkyne. This is done by deprotonating with a strong base like **sodium amide (NaNH₂)** and then reacting the resulting acetylide anion with **methyl chloride (CH₃Cl)**. This creates 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne, which has the correct structure (`Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`) for the subsequent steps.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* Using a strong base like `NaNH₂` with a protic solvent like methanol (Option B) would cause an acid-base reaction, destroying the reagent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Forming the Alkene Precursor (Step 2: Partial Reduction)**\n    The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. It is crucial to stop the reaction at the alkene stage. This requires a \"poisoned\" catalyst. **Lindlar's catalyst (H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate)** is specifically designed for this purpose, selectively reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* Using a strong, unpoisoned catalyst like `H₂/Pd` (Option D) would over-reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane, halting the synthesis.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Cleaving to the Aldehyde (Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis)**\n    The alkene is cleaved using ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde intermediate, a **reductive workup** is essential. **Dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S)** is a standard reagent for this, ensuring the product is an aldehyde.\n    *   *Flaw to avoid:* An oxidative workup, such as with water (`H₂O`) for an internal alkene (Option C), would produce a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) instead of an aldehyde. A carboxylic acid cannot undergo an aldol reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Final Aldol Reaction (Step 4: Base Catalysis)**\n    The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate undergoes a self-condensation reaction. This is catalyzed by a base, such as **barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂)**, which is strong enough to generate the enolate required for the reaction.\n\n### **Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on these careful points, we can evaluate the given sequences:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the chemically sound pathway derived above. Each step uses the correct reagents for the required transformation. **This is the correct sequence.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 1 fails because the strong base `NaNH₂` would react with the methanol solvent.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 3 uses an oxidative workup (`H₂O`), which would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the required aldehyde.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   This is incorrect. Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which would over-reduce the alkyne to an unreactive alkane.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
