When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K.

What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?

The key assumption is that the stellar photosphere is in **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)**. This allows the use of the **Boltzmann equation**. All candidate answers correctly identified this as the fundamental principle.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`) is given by:\n    $$ R = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n    where `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Factor to be Calculated**: The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This requires calculating the ratio of the population ratios at the two given temperatures:\n    *   Temperature without spots: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   Temperature with spots: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{\\text{nospots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} $$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**: When we take the ratio of the two population ratios, the statistical weight term (`g₂/g₁`) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), the formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{nospots}}}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}}}} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right)} $$\n    All candidate answers correctly derived this final formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon from the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. We use the relation `ΔE = hc/λ`. It is convenient to work in electron-volts (eV).\n    *   Wavelength `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n    *   The product `hc` is approximately `1240 eV·nm`.\n    *   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: We substitute all known values into the simplified factor equation.\n    *   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n    *   Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K`\n    *   First, calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n        $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} $$\n    *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n    *   Now, compute the exponent:\n        $$ \\text{Exponent} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right) \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} \\times \\frac{1}{66,000 \\text{ K}} \\approx 1.5057 $$\n    *   Finally, calculate the factor:\n        $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers agree on the physical principles (Boltzmann equation), the derived formula, the calculation steps, and the final numerical result of **~4.5**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the numerical answer.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage are contextual details that are not needed for the calculation, as the two effective temperatures are provided directly. All agents correctly identified and ignored this information.\n*   **Qualitative Sanity Check**: The problem states that the population ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., as the temperature drops). This is physically correct, as higher temperatures are required to excite more atoms to higher energy levels. Therefore, the factor `Ratio(hotter)/Ratio(cooler)` must be greater than 1. The calculated result of `~4.5` is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Mapping Discrepancy**: The candidate answers select different letters (A, B, C, D) despite agreeing on the numerical result. As noted by the agents themselves, this is an artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The crucial task is to match the unanimously agreed-upon numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a factor of approximately **4.5**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a list of careful points, and a final decision based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The problem asks for the factor by which the population ratio of two atomic energy levels changes with temperature. The key assumption is that the stellar photosphere is in **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)**. This allows the use of the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`) is given by:\n    $$ R = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n    where `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Factor to be Calculated**: The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This requires calculating the ratio of the population ratios at the two given temperatures:\n    *   Temperature without spots: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   Temperature with spots: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{\\text{nospots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} $$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression**: When we take the ratio of the two population ratios, the statistical weight term (`g₂/g₁`) cancels out. The formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{nospots}}}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}}}} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right)} $$\n    All candidate answers correctly derived this final formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon from the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. We use the relation `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   Wavelength `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n    *   The product `hc` is approximately `1240 eV·nm`.\n    *   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: We substitute all known values into the simplified factor equation.\n    *   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n    *   Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K`\n    *   First, calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n        $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} $$\n    *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n    *   Now, compute the exponent:\n        $$ \\text{Exponent} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right) \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} \\times \\frac{1}{66,000 \\text{ K}} \\approx 1.5057 $$\n    *   Finally, calculate the factor:\n        $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers show a remarkable consensus. They all correctly identify the Boltzmann equation, derive the correct formula for the factor, and arrive at the same numerical result of **~4.5**. This provides extremely high confidence in the result.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem includes details like the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage. As all candidate answers correctly noted, this information is irrelevant to the calculation since the two effective temperatures are provided directly.\n*   **Qualitative Sanity Check**: The problem states that the population ratio *decreases* when spots are present (i.e., as the temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K). This is physically correct, as higher temperatures are required to excite more atoms to higher energy levels. Therefore, the factor `Ratio(hotter)/Ratio(cooler)` must be greater than 1. The calculated result of `~4.5` is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Randomization**: The candidate answers select different letters (A, B, C, D) despite agreeing on the numerical result. This is a clear artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The crucial takeaway is the unanimous agreement on the numerical value, not the letter.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation, verified by all 15 candidate answers and independent analysis, robustly yields a factor of approximately **4.5**.

This assumption is the physical basis that allows the use of the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of these energy levels.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation for the Factor**: The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`):\n    $$ R = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT)} $$\n    where `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n    The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This requires calculating the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n    *   Temperature without spots: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   Temperature with spots: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{\\text{nospots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{\\text{nospots}})}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{\\text{spots}})}} $$\n    The statistical weight term (`g₂/g₁`) is constant for the transition and cancels out. Using the property of exponents `eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`, the formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right)} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Necessary Values**:\n    *   **Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. We use the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`. It is most convenient to work in electron-volts (eV).\n        *   Convert wavelength: `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n        *   Use the physical constant `hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm`.\n        *   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n    *   **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: `k ≈ 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute all the known values into the simplified factor equation.\n    *   First, calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n        $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} $$\n    *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n    *   Now, compute the exponent:\n        $$ \\text{Exponent} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right) \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1}\\right) \\approx 1.5057 $$\n    *   Finally, calculate the factor:\n        $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus on Methodology and Result**: All provided candidate answers correctly identify the Boltzmann equation as the necessary physical principle. They all derive the correct formula and, most importantly, arrive at the same numerical result of **~4.5**. This unanimous agreement provides extremely high confidence in the calculation.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation, such as the star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the percentage of spot coverage (40%). These are distractors, as the two effective temperatures are given directly.\n*   **Qualitative Sanity Check**: The problem states that the population ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., is cooler). This is physically correct, as a hotter gas will have more atoms excited to higher energy states. Therefore, the ratio `R(6000K)/R(5500K)` must be greater than 1. Our result of `~4.5` is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Mapping**: The candidate answers select different letters (A, B, C, D) despite agreeing on the numerical result.

The key assumption provided is that the stellar photosphere is in **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)**. This assumption is crucial as it validates the use of the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the relative populations of these energy levels. All candidate answers correctly identified this as the fundamental principle.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation for the Factor**: The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio `R` of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (`N₂`) to a lower energy level (`N₁`):\n    $$ R = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT)} $$\n    where `g₂/g₁` is the ratio of statistical weights, `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n    The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This requires calculating the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures:\n    *   Temperature without spots: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    *   Temperature with spots: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_{\\text{nospots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{\\text{nospots}})}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (kT_{\\text{spots}})}} $$\n    The statistical weights term (`g₂/g₁`) is constant for the transition and cancels out. Using the property of exponents `eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ`, the formula simplifies to:\n    $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}}\\right)} $$\n    There is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers on this final formula.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. We use the Planck-Einstein relation, `ΔE = hc/λ`. It is most convenient to work in electron-volts (eV).\n        *   Convert wavelength: `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n        *   Use the convenient physical constant `hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm`.\n        *   `ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Exponent:** Now, we substitute the known values into the exponent of the factor equation.\n        *   `ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n        *   Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K`\n        *   First, calculate the term `ΔE/k`:\n            $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} $$\n        *   Next, calculate the temperature term:\n            $$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{nospots}}} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n        *   Combine these to find the full exponent:\n            $$ \\text{Exponent} = (99379 \\text{ K}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{66,000} \\text{ K}^{-1}\\right) \\approx 1.5057 $$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Final Factor:**\n        $$ \\text{Factor} = e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The star's radius (1.5 solar radii), mass (1.1 solar masses), and the 40% spot coverage are contextual details that are not needed for the calculation. The problem is simplified by the direct provision of the two effective temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K).\n*   **Qualitative Sanity Check**: The problem states that the population ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., is cooler). This is physically correct, as a hotter gas will have more atoms excited to higher energy states. Therefore, the ratio `N₂/N₁` must be higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K. The factor we calculated, `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`, must be greater than 1. Our result of `~4.5` is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Consensus of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify the physical principle, the formula, and the calculation steps. They all arrive at the same numerical result of **~4.5**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the numerical value.\n*   **Discrepancy in Options**: The only discrepancy among the candidate answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is an artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The key takeaway is their unanimous agreement on the numerical result, not the letter.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a factor of approximately **4.5**.
