This is a critical step where isomers must be distinguished.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   Assembling these fragments correctly identifies the substituent as a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. This is distinct from an isobutyl group, which would have a different NMR spectrum (e.g., a doublet for 6H).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThis step requires knowledge of the specified chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagent Function.** The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagent systems that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.

This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagent systems that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Predicting the Transformation.** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl side chain are stable under these conditions and remain unchanged.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Final Product Structure.** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided multiple-choice options and eliminate the incorrect choices.\n\n*   **Careful Point 8: Matching the Product and Analyzing Distractors.**\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This perfectly matches the derived final product.\n        *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an incorrect structure.\n        *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), a common distractor.\n        *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data confirmed a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-step analysis: first, to identify the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from its spectroscopic data, and second, to determine the final product after its reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThis step involves a careful and systematic interpretation of the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.** The IR data provides crucial information about the functional groups present.\n    *   The very broad absorption in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** range, combined with the strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, is a definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded dimer, and the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.** The NMR spectrum allows for the complete structural determination of the molecule's framework.\n    *   The broad singlet far downfield at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the characteristic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR (so far):** The molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Structure Determination.** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the second substituent. It is critical to distinguish between structural isomers.\n    *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   Assembling these fragments [Ring-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃] correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl group**. This is distinct from an isobutyl group [-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂], which would have a different NMR spectrum (e.g., a doublet for 6H).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThis step requires knowledge of the specified chemical transformation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Function.** The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Chemical Transformation.** This reagent system is known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) directly to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**. The stable aromatic ring and the existing sec-butyl group are unaffected by these conditions.\n*   **Conclusion for the Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided multiple-choice options, paying close attention to potential distractors.\n\n*   **Derived Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   **Analysis of Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an incorrect structure.\n    *   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This perfectly matches the derived final product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning from all candidate answers confirms that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a two-step analysis based on the provided spectroscopic data and reaction conditions.
