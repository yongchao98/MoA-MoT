    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with a specific transition energy in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term, `<H>`:**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman energy splitting, is given by the formula:\n  \n  $$ \\langle H \\rangle = \\Delta E_{Zeeman} = m \\mu_B B $$\n\nWhere:\n*   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it has \"small values\". For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can take the maximum non-zero value for the relevant transition, or simply `m = 1`.\n*   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton. Its value is approximately $$9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$$ or $$5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$$.\n*   `B` is the magnetic field strength, given as `B = 1 T`.\n\nLet's calculate `<H>` for `m = 1` and `B = 1 T` in units of Joules (J):\n\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = 1 \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} $$\n\n**2. Calculate the transition energy, `ΔE`:**\n\nThe energy of a photon (`ΔE`) is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the formula:\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is Planck's constant, $$6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$$.\n*   `c` is the speed of light, $$3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$$.\n*   `λ` is the given wavelength, $$0.4861 \\mu m = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$.\n\nNow, let's calculate `ΔE`:\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} $$\n\n**3. Compare the magnitudes:**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $$ \\langle H \\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} $$\n*   Transition energy: $$ \\Delta E = 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} $$\n\nTo compare them, we can find their ratio:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\langle H \\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThis ratio is very small ($$2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$$), which means that the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\n<<<A>>>"
