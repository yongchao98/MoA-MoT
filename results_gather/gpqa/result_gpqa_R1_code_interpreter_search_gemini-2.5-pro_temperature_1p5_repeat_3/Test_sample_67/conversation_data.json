    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state.**\n    The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its state can be described by a two-component spinor.\n    Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_z` in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_i = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    The energy levels are `E = -γ * m_s * ħ * B`, where `m_s = ±1/2` are the spin quantum numbers.\n    \"Aligned with the field\" means the particle is in the lowest energy state. Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest possible value of `m_s`, which is `m_s = +1/2`. This is the spin-up state along the Z-axis.\n    So, the initial state vector at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this is represented by the spinor `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian for t > 0.**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction. The new field is `B_y`. The magnitude `B` remains the same. The new Hamiltonian `H_f` that governs the time evolution for `t>0` is:\n    `H_f = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`.\n    The spin operator `S_y` for a spin-1/2 particle is given by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So, `H_f = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution of the state.**\n    The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i * H_f * t / ħ) * |ψ(0)⟩`.\n    Let's evaluate the time evolution operator `U(t)`:\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) = exp(i * γ * B * t * S_y / ħ)`\n    `U(t) = exp(i * (γ * B * t / 2) * σ_y)`.\n    Let `θ = γ * B * t / 2`. The operator is `exp(i * θ * σ_y)`.\n    Using the property of Pauli matrices that `σ_y^2 = I` (the identity matrix), we can expand the exponential using its Taylor series, which simplifies to:\n    `exp(i * θ * σ_y) = I * cos(θ) + i * σ_y * sin(θ)`.\n    Substituting the matrices for `I` and `σ_y`:\n    `U(t) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] * cos(γBt/2) + i * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * sin(γBt/2)`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`.\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n    `|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment operator is `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n    `S_z = (ħ/2) * σ_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    The expectation value `<μ_z>` at time `t` is given by `<ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    First, let's find `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    The bra vector `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`, which is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]`.\n    `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    `= (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`.\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`, we get:\n    `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n    Now, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the oscillation frequency.**\n    The expression for the average of the z-component of the moment is `<μ_z>(t) = A * cos(ωt)`, where the amplitude is `A = γħ/2` and the angular frequency is `ω = γB`.\n    This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nThe calculated oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
