    "*   **Analysis of the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that *eliminates* the anti-nutritional compound. This means we are looking for a \"knockout\" mutation, one that will most likely render the protein, which synthesizes the compound, completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes a DNA codon, but the new codon codes for the same amino acid. No effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a codon to one that codes for a different amino acid. This alters the protein, but it may or may not disable it. The effect can range from negligible to complete loss of function.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA in DNA). This causes the ribosome to stop translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated, and almost always non-functional, protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons, usually resulting in a completely different and non-functional amino acid sequence, often ending in a premature stop codon.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that *is* a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but leaves the rest of the reading frame intact. It may or may not disable the protein.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Mutants:** We will translate the beginning of each gene sequence into its amino acid sequence to see the effect of the mutation. The genetic code is read in triplets (codons), starting from `ATG`.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...\n        *   mRNA: 5'-AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU...\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n        *   This is the functional gene that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...\n        *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n        *   Type: This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. While this *might* inactivate the protein, it's not a guarantee.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...\n        *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: The DNA codon `TAA` corresponds to the mRNA codon `UAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Translation will stop after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...\n        *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   Type: These are **missense mutations**. A full-length protein is produced with two altered amino acids. Again, this is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Original: `...GCT GGT ACT...` (Ala - Gly - Thr)\n        *   Mutant: `...GCT --- ACT...`\n        *   Changes: A comparison of the full strings for the intact gene and Mutant 4 reveals that the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n        *   Type: This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine). The rest of the protein will be synthesized in the correct reading frame. Removing one amino acid can be disruptive, but it is less likely to completely abolish function than a premature stop codon that eliminates almost the entire protein.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) very early in the gene sequence. This will result in a severely truncated protein that is virtually certain to be non-functional. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
