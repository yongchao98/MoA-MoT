    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Elucidating the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → Product 1:**\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is brominated at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group). Acetic anhydride likely serves to form an acyl bromide intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base.\n    *   Reactant: CH3-COOH\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n2.  **Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4, heat → Product 2:**\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid (bromoacetic acid) reacts with an alcohol (ethanol, CH3CH2OH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) to form an ester.\n    *   Product 1: Br-CH2-COOH\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN → Product 3:**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the alpha-carbon.\n    *   Product 2: Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3\n    *   Product 3: NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH, then 1,5-dibromopentane → Product 4:**\n    *   This is a multi-step process within one reaction vessel.\n    *   **a. Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from ethyl cyanoacetate. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the resulting negative charge on the carbon is stabilized by resonance with both the nitrile (-CN) group and the ester (-COOEt) group.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **b. First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-Br) in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH(COOEt)]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n    *   **c. Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the product from the first alkylation, which still has one acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n        *   (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n    *   **d. Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a six-membered ring (the alpha-carbon + the five carbons from the pentane chain).\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the same carbon (C1). The chemical name is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n           CN\n          /\n     (C1)----COOCH2CH3\n    /   \\\n H2C(C2)--CH2(C6)\n/           \\\nH2C(C3)         CH2(C5)\n\\           /\n ----CH2(C4)----\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, due to rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring and free rotation of the substituents, the molecule possesses an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester's C=O and ether oxygen.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Ethyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n        1.  **-CH₃ protons:** The three hydrogens of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n        2.  **-OCH₂- protons:** The C1 carbon is a prochiral center (it is attached to four different groups if we consider the ring pathways). Therefore, the two methylene hydrogens of the ethyl group are diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Cyclohexane ring:**\n        3.  **C2 and C6 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6. However, on C2 itself, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation). Thus, there is one set of two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C6) and another set of two equivalent protons (the other one on C2, the other on C6). **(2 signals)**\n        4.  **C3 and C5 protons:** The same logic applies as for C2/C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives two distinct signals from these four protons. **(2 signals)**\n        5.  **C4 protons:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. The plane bisects the H-C4-H angle, making the two protons on C4 mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are homotopic and chemically equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH₃) + 2 (OCH₂) = 3 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 1 (C4) = 5 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = 8**\n\n<<<C>>>"
