    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is an anhydride derived from a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data provided for this anhydride (¹H: single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   The single ¹H peak at 7 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent vinylic protons.\n        *   The ¹³C peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent alkene carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n        *   The *cis* geometry of the precursor (maleic acid) is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride upon dehydration.\n\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The *endo* product is usually the major product formed under kinetic control due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, while the *exo* product is the minor (and usually more thermodynamically stable) product. The question explicitly states a major and a minor product are formed.\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclic adduct. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene derivative.\n        *   The cyclopentadiene provides the C1-C4 and C7 carbons of the bicyclic system. The methyl groups from the diene are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3). The methylene group (CH₂) of the diene becomes the C7 bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride moiety fuses to the C5 and C6 positions. The two protons from the maleic anhydride are now attached to C5 and C6.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) → Adduct (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and the NOESY Spectrum:**\n    *   The key difference between the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products lies in the spatial arrangement of the fused anhydride ring. A NOESY spectrum shows through-space correlations (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) between protons that are close to each other (< 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates the corresponding protons are in close proximity.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of proton groups that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons on the anhydride ring (at C5 and C6) are spatially close to the methyl groups attached to the double bond (the vinylic methyls at C2 and C3).\n\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the C2=C3 double bond. In this conformation, the protons at C5 and C6 are far from the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3.\n\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak that is strong in the major product and weak/absent in the minor product must be the one connecting the **protons at C5/C6** and the **vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3**.\n\n4.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry in both isomers, pairs of groups are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Protons at C5 and C6:** These two protons are equivalent. They are on sp³ carbons, but they are alpha to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in the anhydride ring. This deshielding effect will shift their resonance significantly downfield. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is very reasonable for these protons. Since they are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons), they will appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Groups (at C2 and C3):** These two methyl groups are equivalent. They are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinylic methyls is in the range of 1.6-2.0 ppm. Therefore, the signal at **~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Groups (at C1 and C4):** These two methyl groups are also equivalent. They are attached to saturated tertiary carbons. Their chemical shift would be further upfield, around **~1.0-1.2 ppm**. The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** in option D corresponds to this group.\n    *   The \"1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" mentioned in options A and B does not correspond to any of the major symmetric groups and likely represents one of the non-equivalent methylene bridge protons at C7.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Answer:**\n    *   The key NOE cross-peak connects the protons at C5/C6 and the vinylic methyl groups at C2/C3.\n    *   Based on our assignment, this corresponds to the cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nLet's review the choices:\nA) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (Incorrect group)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. (Incorrect groups; NOE between bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton would not be the defining difference)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. (This correctly identifies the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which show the characteristic NOE difference between endo and exo isomers).\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. (This would be an NOE between bridgehead and vinylic methyls, which should be present in both isomers).\n\n<<<C>>>"
