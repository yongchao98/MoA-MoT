    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Define variables and parse the given information**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. The problem states it is \"2 times more massive than the other\". This is interpreted as `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the rest masses and rest-mass energies of the fragments**\n\nFirst, let's find the masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This is also the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments (`T1 + T2`).\n\n`Q = E_initial - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n`|p1| = |p2|` => `p1^2 = p2^2`\n\nUsing the classical formula:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n\nSubstitute the mass relationship `m1 = 2 * m2`:\n`(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `1000 MeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe kinetic energy `T` is given by `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1^2 = p2^2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`. We also know `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Let's substitute these values (all energies are in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * 198 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * 99`\n`T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396 * T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600 * T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a short python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Initial rest mass energy\nM_c2 = 300\n\n# Fragment rest mass energies\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Total kinetic energy (Q-value)\nQ = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Classical T1 calculation\n# T1_cl + T2_cl = Q\n# m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl => 2 * T1_cl = T2_cl\n# 3 * T1_cl = Q\nT1_cl = Q / 3\n\n# Relativistic T1 calculation\n# Equation derived in reasoning: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_rel = 603 / 600\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_rel - T1_cl) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_cl * 1000} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_rel * 1000} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\n```\nClassical T1: 1000.0 MeV\nRelativistic T1: 1005.0 MeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n```\nThe python script confirms the manual calculation.\n\n### **6. Find the difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` value and the classical `T1` value.\n\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Parse Given Information**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment `m1` is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2*m*T`.\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2` implies:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between momentum `p`, kinetic energy `T`, and rest mass energy `m*c^2` is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nAgain, from momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
