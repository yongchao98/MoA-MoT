We will use relativistic energy formulas to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. Its energy is effectively its rest mass energy, $E_{\\bar{p}} = m_{\\bar{p}}c^2$.\n*   The proton is assumed to be at rest, so its energy is its rest mass energy, $E_p = m_p c^2$.\n*   Protons and antiprotons have the same mass. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The initial energy is converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All four have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy released will be distributed among these four particles. Due to the symmetry of the products, we can assume the energy is shared equally.\n*   The energy of each moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n*   We are given that $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Solve for Velocity (v)**\n\n*   First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n\n*   Now, use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$\n\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v = 0.77c$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The annihilation process is governed by the principle of conservation of energy. We will use relativistic energy formulas to solve for the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1. Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. The proton is assumed to be at rest.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$. Protons and antiprotons have identical mass.\n*   $E_{initial} = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Define the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The initial energy is converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. These four particles all have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   By the law of conservation of energy, the total energy released will be distributed among these four particles. Due to the symmetry of the final products (starting from a near-zero momentum state), we can assume the energy is shared equally among them, and they all have the same speed, $v$.\n*   The energy of each moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n*   We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   Equate the initial energy and the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Velocity ($v$)**\n\n*   First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n*   Next, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n*   Since $\\beta = v/c$, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated value of 0.7688c is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>"
