    "This problem requires identifying the correct reagents for two separate organic reactions. Let's analyze each reaction individually.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (butan-2-one) reacting with a cyanide source (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The sodium cyanide (NaCN) dissociates to provide the cyanide ion (:C≡N⁻), which is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   The cyanide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   The π-bond of the carbonyl group breaks, and the electrons move onto the oxygen atom, forming a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate:\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + :C≡N⁻  →  CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺  →  CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). In a typical laboratory procedure, this can be achieved by generating hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in situ by adding a mineral acid to the NaCN solution, or by performing an acidic workup after the nucleophilic addition step. `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion) is the general representation for a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4 in water), which serves as an excellent proton source. `NaHSO3` (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to carbonyls but is not used as the proton source in cyanohydrin formation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Therefore, `A = H3O⁺` is the most suitable choice.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. The rest of the molecule (the α-hydroxy group and the aromatic rings) remains unchanged.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating in the presence of either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction is carried out with water, and reagent B acts as a catalyst.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Requires a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Requires a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting carboxylate salt.\n3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent B must be a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is commonly used for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n    *   `CH3COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze this reaction, which requires more forcing conditions.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Therefore, `B = HCl` is the appropriate reagent.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, `A = H3O⁺`.\n*   For the second reaction, `B = HCl`.\n\nCombining these results, the correct pair of reagents is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
