    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the Reactions\n\nWe are given four chemical reactions and descriptions of the substances involved. The goal is to identify substance E and its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Most Constraining Clues\n\nReaction 3 is very specific. The hydrolysis of a substance (C) regenerates the starting material (A) and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). This is characteristic of a disproportionation reaction of a non-metal halide in an intermediate oxidation state.\n\nLet's hypothesize based on common elements. Sulfur compounds often exhibit this behavior. Consider the hydrolysis of a sulfur chloride:\n`2 SCl₂ + 2 H₂O → S(s) + SO₂(g) + 4 HCl(aq)`\n\nLet's see if this fits the description:\n*   **A = S (Sulfur)**: Elemental sulfur is a solid. The product of the reaction is elemental sulfur (precipitated). This fits.\n*   **F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**: HCl is a strong acid. This fits.\n*   **G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)**: The gaseous product SO₂ dissolves in water to form H₂SO₃, a weak acid. This fits.\n*   **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**: If the hydrolysis reaction is correct, then C must be SCl₂.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Hypothesis with Other Reactions\n\nNow we check if this assignment works for the other reactions.\n\n*   **Substance C:** C is sulfur dichloride (SCl₂). SCl₂ is a cherry-red liquid. This matches the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C\n    If A = Sulfur (whose stable allotrope is S₈) and C = SCl₂, we need to find B. The reaction to form SCl₂ from S₈ is:\n    `S₈(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → 8 SCl₂(l)`\n    This reaction shows that 1 mole of solid A (S₈) reacts with 8 moles (equivalents) of gas B to form 8 moles of product C (SCl₂), which is consistent with the problem statement if C refers to the monomer unit.\n    So, **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)**.\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n    We know B = Cl₂. So, `D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(l)`.\n    A common 1:1 addition reaction between a gas (D) and chlorine gas (Cl₂) that produces a liquid solvent (H) is the chlorination of ethene:\n    `C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)`\n    This identifies:\n    *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethene/Ethylene gas)**\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane, a common solvent)**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)\n    Now we can identify E.\n    *   C = SCl₂\n    *   D = C₂H₄\n    The reaction is: `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E`\n    This is a known reaction, the Levinstein process, for the synthesis of mustard gas:\n    `SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S`\n    So, **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or Mustard Gas)**.\n    Mustard gas is a chemical warfare agent and fits the description \"extremely hazardous product\".\n\nAll pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E\n\nThe final task is to find the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E, which is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a central sulfur atom bonded to two identical chloroethyl groups. Due to the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the C-S-C bond is bent, similar to the H-O-H bond in water.\n2.  **Conformation:** The two `-CH₂CH₂Cl` arms are flexible due to free rotation around the single bonds (S-C and C-C). The molecule will adopt a minimum energy conformation. Experimental studies (gas electron diffraction) and computational chemistry have shown that the most stable conformer does not have high symmetry.\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** There is no mirror plane in the stable conformation of mustard gas. The molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n    *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** The most stable conformation possesses a single two-fold rotation axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the identification of E as mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`, and the analysis of its molecular structure, the point group is C₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
