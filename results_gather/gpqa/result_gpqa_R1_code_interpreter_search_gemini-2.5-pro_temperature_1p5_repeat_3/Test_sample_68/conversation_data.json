    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   A relativistic particle ($X^0$) is created and moves through a detector (Bubble Chamber).\n*   Due to its high speed, its lifetime in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) because of time dilation.\n*   The particle decays exponentially. The number of particles surviving after a time $t$ in the lab frame is given by $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$, where $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n*   A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance $L$ that is large enough for the detector to distinguish the decay point (vertex) from the creation point. This distance $L$ is the resolution.\n*   The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30%* of the decays. This means we are looking for a resolution length $L$ such that the fraction of particles that travel a distance $x \\ge L$ before decaying is at least 0.30.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equations**\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its rest mass $m_0$ by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n    $ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} $\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by:\n    $ \\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 $\n*   **Velocity ($\\beta = v/c$):** The velocity can be found from the Lorentz factor:\n    $ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\implies \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} $\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n    $ \\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau_0 $\n*   **Decay Probability:** The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ before decaying follows an exponential distribution $p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-x/\\lambda}$. The probability of traveling a distance *at least* $L$ is:\n    $ P(x \\ge L) = \\int_L^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-x/\\lambda} dx = e^{-L/\\lambda} $\n*   **Condition:** We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to:\n    $ P(x \\ge L) \\ge 0.30 \\implies e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30 $\n\n**3. Solve for the Resolution L**\n\nFrom the condition $e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$:\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$ -\\frac{L}{\\lambda} \\ge \\ln(0.30) $\nMultiplying by $-\\lambda$ (and reversing the inequality sign):\n$ L \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) $\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". In the context of detectors, a better resolution means a smaller resolvable distance. However, the problem asks for the resolution *needed*, which implies finding the boundary condition. The condition $L \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$ gives the requirement on the detector resolution $L$. Any detector with a resolution smaller than or equal to this value will observe at least 30% of the decays. A \"minimum resolution\" in this context refers to the maximum allowed value for this distance $L$ (the coarsest resolution that still works). Therefore, we calculate the maximum allowed value for L:\n$ L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) $\n\n**4.

The order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is correct. The numerical difference is approximately 9%, which is likely due to a small rounding or typo in the values given in the problem statement or the options.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution `L` of a detector required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle X⁰. Observing a decay means that the particle travels a distance `L` or greater before it decays, so the decay vertex is distinguishable from the creation vertex.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physics Concepts:**\n    *   **Special Relativity:** The particle X⁰ is moving at a relativistic speed. This means we need to account for time dilation and length contraction.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ_0`) by a factor of gamma (`γ`).\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle survives after traveling a distance `x` is related to the mean decay length (`λ`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Necessary Equations:**\n\n    a.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor relates the total energy (`E`) of a particle to its rest mass energy (`m₀c²`).\n        $ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} $\n\n    b.  **Mean Decay Length (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is the product of the particle's velocity (`v`) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`).\n        $ \\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} $\n        We know that `τ_lab = γτ_0` (time dilation) and `v = βc`, where `β` is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light `c`.\n        So, $ \\lambda = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0 $\n        A useful relativistic identity is $ \\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} $.\n        Therefore, $ \\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} $.\n\n    c.  **Decay Probability:** The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` before decaying follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle travels a distance *greater than or equal to* `L` is given by:\n        $ P(x \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda} $\n\n4.  **Apply the Condition from the Problem:**\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of a particle traveling a distance `L` or more must be at least 0.30.\n    $ P(x \\ge L) \\ge 0.30 $\n    $ e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30 $\n\n5.  **Solve for the Resolution (L):**\n    To solve for `L`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality:\n    $ \\ln(e^{-L/\\lambda}) \\ge \\ln(0.30) $\n    $ -\\frac{L}{\\lambda} \\ge \\ln(0.30) $\n    Multiplying by `-λ` reverses the inequality sign:\n    $ L \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.30) $\n    The question asks for the minimum resolution required. This corresponds to the boundary condition, or the maximum length `L` that still satisfies the condition of observing *at least* 30% of the decays.

    "**Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the minimum resolution, which we'll call `L`, needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰. Observing a decay means the particle must travel a distance of at least `L` before it decays.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Effects:** The particle X⁰ is highly relativistic because its total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). This means we must use principles of special relativity.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor quantifies the relativistic effects. It is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n    $ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} $\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    $ \\gamma = \\frac{27 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 7.9179 $\n\n4.  **Time Dilation:** Due to its high speed, the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the factor $\\gamma$.\n    $ \\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 $\n\n5.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n    $ \\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} $\n    We know that $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ is $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$, which can be rearranged to $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    Substituting everything in, we get:\n    $ \\lambda = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0 $\n    We can use the identity $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n    $ \\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} $\n    Let's calculate this value:\n    $ \\lambda = (3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.9179)^2 - 1} $\n    $ \\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} $\n    $ \\lambda \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) \\times \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx (2.4 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 7.854 $\n    $ \\lambda \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} $\n    (The code output provides a more precise value of $1.882 \\times 10^{-6}$ m).\n\n6.  **Decay Probability Condition:** The number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $x$ follows an exponential decay law: $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}$. The probability of a single particle traveling a distance of at least `L` before decaying is $P(x \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$.\n    The problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed, which means:\n    $ P(x \\ge L) \\ge 0.30 $\n    $ e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30 $\n\n7.  **Solving for Resolution L:** To find the minimum resolution `L` (which corresponds to the maximum travel distance that satisfies the condition), we solve the equality:\n    $ e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30 $\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $ \\ln(e^{-L/\\lambda}) = \\ln(0.30) $\n    $ -\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204 $\n    Solve for `L`:\n    $ L = - \\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30) $\n    $ L = - (1.882 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\times (-1.204) $\n    $ L \\approx 2.267 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} $\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. We compare this result to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\n    The value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The order of magnitude is correct, and it is the closest numerical match. The small difference can be attributed to rounding or slight variations in the problem's input values versus the values used to generate the options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
