    "This problem requires us to find the pH of a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). We will solve this by first calculating the moles of each species, then determining the net amount of acid or base after neutralization reactions, and finally calculating the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2 OH-.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of hydroxide ions, moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Perform neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will first neutralize the strong acid (H+), and any remaining strong base will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   Reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining after this reaction = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- (a strong base) and 0.050 moles of acetate (CH3COO-, a weak base). The pH will be dominated by the concentration of the strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167)\n\nLet's use a script for the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\nmoles_excess_oh = 0.050\ntotal_volume = 1.2\n\nconc_oh = moles_excess_oh / total_volume\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pOH of the solution is: {pOH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\nThe pOH of the solution is: 1.38\nThe pH of the solution is: 12.62\n\nThe pOH of the solution is approximately 1.38.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.38 (This is the pOH value)\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62 (This matches our calculation)\nD) 8.92\n\nThe correct answer is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the number of moles of H+ ions from the strong acid (HCl) and weak acid (CH3COOH), and the moles of OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2).**\n\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n\n    *   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), so moles of H⁺ = **0.080 mol**.\n\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it dissociates completely and yields two moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**.\n\n2.  **Determine the result of the neutralization reaction.** The strong base (OH⁻) will react with all the available acid protons, neutralizing the strong acid's H⁺ first, and then the weak acid's protons.\n\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ (protons) available for reaction:**\n        *   Total H⁺ = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n    *   **Reaction:** OH⁻ will react with H⁺.\n        *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n        *   Initial moles of total acid (H⁺) = 0.130 mol\n        *   Since there are more moles of base than acid, the acid will be completely consumed.\n        *   **Moles of excess OH⁻** = Initial OH⁻ - Total H⁺ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution.** The final solution contains excess strong base (OH⁻). Therefore, we first calculate the concentration of OH⁻, then the pOH, and finally the pH.\n\n    *   **Total volume of the solution:**\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**.\n\n    *   **Concentration of excess OH⁻:**\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        *   pH + pOH = 14\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
