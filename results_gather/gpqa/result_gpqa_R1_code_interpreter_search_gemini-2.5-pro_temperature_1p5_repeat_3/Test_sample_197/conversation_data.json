    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    In a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions, a series of complexation reactions occur, forming various cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. The species containing cobalt are:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ion\n    *   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n    *   [Co(SCN)₂] (the complex of interest)\n    *   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n    *   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂) of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex:**\n    The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is the ratio of the concentration of that specific complex to the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed for this calculation, as we are asked for a relative percentage and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is given.\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    First, calculate the denominator (let's call it D):\n    *   `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n    *   `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    *   `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    *   `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator (N), which corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` term:\n    *   `N = β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `N = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01`\n    *   `N = 0.4`\n\n    Finally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n    *   `α₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert the mole fraction to a percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a script for the calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# Denominator term of the mole fraction equation\n# D = 1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4\nD = 1 + beta1*SCN_conc**1 + beta2*SCN_conc**2 + beta3*SCN_conc**3 + beta4*SCN_conc**4\n\n# Numerator term for the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2]\n# N = beta2*[SCN-]^2\nN = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = N / D\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
