    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C2 position of the ring. By IUPAC convention for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1, so the carbonyl carbon is adjacent to it.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R)- or (S)-**: This indicates the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone (Î´-lactone), which is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid.\n\nLet's draw the product and number the ring atoms according to IUPAC rules:\n```\n      O(1)\n     /  \\\n C(6)H2  C(2)=O\n |       |\nC(5)H2  C(3)H2\n \\      /\n   C(4)H-CH2CH3  <-- Chiral Center\n```\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provided are all stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon carboxylic acid chain.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3. This is the chiral center of the starting material.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that the molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The carboxyl group at C1 is a free acid (-COOH), while the carboxyl group at C5 has been converted to an isobutyl ester (-COOCH2CH(CH3)2).\n\nThe structure is:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\nThe chiral center is C3.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it typically does not reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(LiBH4)--> `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n    The intermediate is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid at C1. This is an intramolecular esterification, which forms a stable six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from C5-OH), C5, C4, C3, C2, C1(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. In the IUPAC name of the lactone product, this position is C4. So the product is indeed 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: Neither the reduction of the ester nor the subsequent lactonization involves breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)-configuration**.\n*   So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis eliminates options A and C.\n\n### **4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: B\n*   **Reagents**: BH3 (Borane), followed by H+ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\n**Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH3) is a powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   Carboxylic acid group at C1 (`-COOH`) will be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n*   Ester group at C5 (`-COOiBu`) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Reaction Pathway**:\n1.  **Reduction**:\n    `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu` --(BH3)--> `HO-CH2(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)O-iBu`\n    The intermediate is **isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**. (Note: IUPAC naming starts from the ester C1, so the OH is on C5).\n2.  **Lactonization**: During the acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group (originally from C1) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester at C5. This is an intramolecular transesterification, which also forms a six-membered ring (a delta-lactone).\n    Ring formation involves atoms: `O(from the new OH), C1, C2, C3, C4, C5(=O)`.\n3.  **Mapping to Product**: The resulting lactone also has the ethyl group on the carbon that was C3 of the starting chain. As established before, this corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product. Thus, this reaction also produces 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**Stereochemistry**: As in Reaction 1, the reduction and lactonization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is **retained**.\n*   To get the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)-configuration**.\n*   So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** isomer.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to the following choice:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<B>>>"
