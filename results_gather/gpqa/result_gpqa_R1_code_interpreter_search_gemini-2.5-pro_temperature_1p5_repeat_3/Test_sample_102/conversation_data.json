    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,3,5. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct new ones to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding -COCH3):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings. A ring with a -NO2 group is too deactivated. It also does not work on rings with an -NH2 group (aniline) because the amine is a Lewis base that reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst.\n*   **1,3,5-Substitution:** To achieve this pattern, we generally need to use *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitutions, or use a \"placeholder\" group that can be modified or removed later (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction sequence).\n\n**4. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to the ring. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3. This successfully creates a 1,3 substitution pattern.\n*   **Step iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. We now have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects are conflicting, the position meta to both groups (C5) is the least deactivated overall. The reaction is known to proceed with good yield to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. **At this point, the target molecule has been synthesized.**\n*   The remaining steps (iv-vii) seem extraneous and chemically flawed (e.g., nitrating a sensitive aniline derivative), but the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target product.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride**\n*   **Step iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene:** This sequence of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) results in converting benzene back into benzene. This pathway is nonsensical.\n\n**Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product):** The -Br group is *ortho, para*-directing, with the *para* product favored.\n*   **Step iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ???** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on aniline. The lone pair of the -NH2 group (a Lewis base) will react with the AlCl3 catalyst (a Lewis acid), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. **This reaction will fail.** Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule. The sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The first three steps of Option A represent the most effective synthesis among the choices. The superfluous steps at the end are likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>"
