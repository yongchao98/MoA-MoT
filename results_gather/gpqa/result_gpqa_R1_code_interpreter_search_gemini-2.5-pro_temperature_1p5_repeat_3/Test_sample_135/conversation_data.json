    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\n\nThe problem states that the vector field `f(r)` falls off radially as `1/r^2`. This means:\n*   The field has a component only in the radial direction (`r_hat`).\n*   The magnitude of the field is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n\nSo, we can write the vector field `f` in spherical coordinates as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Goal**\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**3. Choose the Method: Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where the magnitude `1/r^2` goes to infinity. Directly calculating the divergence `∇ . f` can be tricky because of this singularity.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is the ideal tool for this situation. It relates the volume integral of the divergence to a surface integral over the boundary of the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = ∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`\n\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n*   `n_hat` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`. For a sphere, this is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n*   `dS` is the differential surface area element.\n\nThe advantage of this theorem is that the surface integral is evaluated on the surface of the sphere (`r=R`), where the field is well-behaved and finite.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n\nLet's compute the components of the surface integral `∮_S (f . n_hat) dS`.\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product `(f . n_hat)`:**\n    `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    `n_hat = r_hat`\n    `f . n_hat = ((1/r^2) * r_hat) . r_hat = 1/r^2` (since `r_hat . r_hat = 1`)\n\n*   **Evaluate the dot product on the surface `S`:**\n    The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`. On this entire surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    So, on the surface, `f . n_hat = 1/R^2`.\n\n*   **Set up and solve the integral:**\n    `∮_S (f . n_hat) dS = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    Since `1/R^2` is a constant with respect to the surface integration, we can pull it out of the integral:\n    `= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n\n*   **Interpret the remaining integral `∮_S dS`:**\n    This integral is simply the total surface area of the sphere `S`. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is given by the formula `4πR^2`.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    `= (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    `= 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n`∫_V (∇ . f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n**(Alternative reasoning using Dirac Delta Function)**\nFor those familiar with it, the divergence of this specific field is known to be `∇ . (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The integral of the delta function over a volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore, `∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`. This confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem.\n\n<<<D>>>"
