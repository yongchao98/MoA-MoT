    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the physical system:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. This oscillating charge distribution will create time-varying electric and magnetic fields, which results in the radiation of electromagnetic waves. The wavelength of this radiation is given as `λ`.\n\n2.  **Model the radiation source:** Any oscillating charge distribution can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The lowest order and typically dominant term in this expansion is the electric dipole, followed by the magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole, and then higher-order terms.\n\n    *   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** This is the most fundamental and often the strongest type of radiation. It occurs when the electric dipole moment `**p**` of the charge distribution oscillates. An example would be a rigid charged spheroid oscillating back and forth along the z-axis.\n    *   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** This term becomes dominant if the electric dipole moment remains constant (e.g., zero due to symmetry). An example would be a spheroid that deforms (e.g., from prolate to oblate and back) while its center of charge remains fixed.\n    *   **Magnetic Dipole Radiation:** This term can also be a leading term and involves an oscillating magnetic dipole moment `**m**`.\n\n3.  **Determine the functional form of radiated power `f(λ, θ)`:** We need to find the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) on the wavelength `λ` and the angle `θ`.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Electric Dipole Radiation**\n        If we model the source as an oscillating electric dipole with its moment `**p**` aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is given by:\n        `dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n        Here, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. The relationship between `ω` and `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n        Substituting this into the power equation, we see the dependence on `λ` and `θ`:\n        `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ * sin²(θ) = λ⁻⁴ sin²(θ)`\n        So, for an electric dipole, the power has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation**\n        If the source is an oscillating electric quadrupole (e.g., a deforming spheroid), the radiated power is proportional to `ω⁶`.\n        `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁶ ∝ (1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`\n        The angular dependence for a common type of quadrupole oscillating along the z-axis (like a prolate-oblate deformation) is `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. So, `f(λ, θ) ∝ λ⁻⁶ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the fraction of maximum power:** The problem states that `A` is the maximum radiated power per unit solid angle. We need to find the power at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of `A`.\n\n    *   **Applying Case 1 (Dipole Model):**\n        The power is `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n        The maximum power `A` occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°`.\n        So, `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n        The power at `θ = 30°` is `f(λ, 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n        Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n        The fraction of the maximum power is `f(λ, 30°) / A = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n    *   **Applying Case 2 (Quadrupole Model):**\n        The power is `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ) = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`.\n        The maximum power `A` occurs when `sin²(2θ)` is maximum, which is 1. This happens at `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n        `A ∝ sin²(45°)cos²(45°) = (1/√2)²(1/√2)² = 1/4`.\n        The power at `θ = 30°` is `f(λ, 30°) ∝ sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)²(√3/2)² = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16`.\n        The fraction of the maximum power is `f(λ, 30°) / A = (3/16) / (1/4) = 3/4`.\n\n5.  **Match with the options:**\n    *   Our dipole model calculation gives a fraction of `1/4` and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`. This matches option **C)**.\n    *   Our quadrupole model calculation gives a fraction of `3/4` and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁶`. This matches option **A)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The problem is somewhat ambiguous, as the \"oscillating spheroid\" could be interpreted as a dipole or a quadrupole source. However, in the absence of information that forces the dipole moment to be zero, the electric dipole radiation is the lowest-order and dominant radiation mechanism. Standard physics problems typically test this fundamental case unless a more complex source is explicitly stated. Therefore, the most plausible intended answer is based on the electric dipole model.\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at 30° = **1/4**\n*   Possible form of f includes `λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's double-check the calculation for the fraction using a simple code.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Dipole radiation model\n# Power is proportional to sin(theta)^2\ntheta_deg = 30\n# Maximum power is at theta = 90 degrees\ntheta_max_deg = 90\n\n# Convert degrees to radians\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\ntheta_max_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_max_deg)\n\n# Calculate the power at 30 degrees relative to the maximum power\nfraction = (np.sin(theta_rad)**2) / (np.sin(theta_max_rad)**2)\n\nprint(fraction)\n```\nExecution of the code will yield:\n```\n0.25\n```\nThe fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. The wavelength dependence for dipole radiation is `λ⁻⁴`. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the fraction of maximum power radiated at a specific angle and for the functional form of the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`. The source is an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroidal shape and symmetry along the z-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Modeling the Radiating Source\nAny oscillating charge distribution can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The lowest-order (and usually dominant) term is the electric dipole radiation, which arises from an oscillating electric dipole moment.\n\nA spheroid with its symmetry axis along the z-axis that is oscillating as a whole (e.g., its center of charge moving up and down the z-axis) will have an oscillating electric dipole moment `p(t)` directed along the z-axis. This is the simplest and most common physical scenario for an \"oscillating charge distribution\" of this shape. We will proceed with this electric dipole model, as it is the leading-order contribution to the radiation.\n\n### Step 2: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\nFor electric dipole radiation, the time-averaged power `P` radiated per unit solid angle `Ω` is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀²ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nHere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`. Substituting this into the power equation, we see the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` term. This narrows down the options to C and D.\n\n### Step 3: Angular Dependence and Fraction of Maximum Power\nThe angular dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle is given by the `sin²(θ)` term.\n`f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians), perpendicular to the axis of oscillation.\n*   `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1² = 1`\n\nWe need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of this maximum power `A`.\nAt `θ = 30°`:\n*   The power is proportional to `sin²(30°)`.\n*   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n*   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n`Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (proportionality constant * sin²(30°)) / (proportionality constant * sin²(90°))`\n`Fraction = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence in `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
