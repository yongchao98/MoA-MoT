    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a center of inversion.\n    ```\n       H      C3H7\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7    H\n    ```\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation. This reaction is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **trans-alkene + syn-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. Let's call them E(R,R) and E(S,S).\n\n*   **Step 1b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+).** The acid protonates the epoxide's oxygen, making it a good leaving group. Water then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the epoxide ring. This nucleophilic attack occurs with an inversion of configuration at the site of attack (SN2-like mechanism). This is an **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the ring-opening for each enantiomeric epoxide:\n        *   **For the (4R,5R)-epoxide (E(R,R))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (R → S). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are designations for the same **meso** compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n        *   **For the (4S,5S)-epoxide (E(S,S))**:\n            *   Water attacks C4: Inversion at C4 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4R, 5S).\n            *   Water attacks C5: Inversion at C5 (S → R). The configuration becomes (4S, 5R).\n            *   Again, both attacks lead to the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Therefore, the final product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    ```\n       H      H\n        \\    /\n         C==C\n        /    \\\n      C3H7  C3H7\n    ```\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA (syn-addition).**\n    *   The stereochemical rule is: **cis-alkene + syn-addition → meso compound**.\n    *   The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene produces a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Ring-opening with aqueous acid (H3O+) (anti-addition).**\n    *   We start with the single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic.\n    *   Water attacks the protonated epoxide:\n        *   Attack at C4 (which has S configuration): Inversion at C4 (S → R). The product configuration is (4R, 5R).\n        *   Attack at C5 (which has R configuration): Inversion at C5 (R → S). The product configuration is (4S, 5S).\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at either enantiotopic carbon is equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts, resulting in a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nNote that the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like the meso-diol compared to the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol (which is achiral) will elute as a single peak. Since it is a diastereomer of the other two, its retention time will be different from both.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
