    "This question asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` generated by a moving point charge `q`. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Define the Variables\n\nLet's first clarify the notation used in the problem, which is standard in this context:\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `tr`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the charge emitted the signal (electromagnetic field) that reaches the observer at point `r` at time `t`.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t=tr`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`: The distance between the charge's retarded position and the observation point.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in vacuum.\n*   `epsilon_o`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `mu_o`: The permeability of free space.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` is that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, covers the distance `d` in the time interval `t - tr`.\n`t - tr = d / c`\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\n\nThe potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `rho(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nwhere the source time is the retarded time `tr = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be represented using the Dirac delta function:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nSubstituting the delta-function densities into the retarded potential integrals is not straightforward due to the dependence of `tr` on the integration variable `r'`. A standard, rigorous derivation involves a change of variables or using the Green's function method.\n\nLet's perform the derivation for the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\nThe retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`. This makes the argument of the delta function dependent on `r'`.\n\nA more direct approach is to integrate over time with another delta function:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\iint \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} \\delta(t' - (t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c)) dt' d^3r'$\n\nFirst, we integrate over the spatial coordinates `d^3r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(t'))` sets `r'` to `s(t')`.\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\delta(t' - t + |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|/c) dt'$\n\nNow we use the property of the delta function: `∫f(x)δ(g(x))dx = f(x₀)/|g'(x₀)|`, where `g(x₀)=0`.\nHere, `x = t'`, `f(t') = 1/|r - s(t')|`, and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(t')=0` gives `t - t' = |r - s(t')|/c`, which is precisely the definition of the retarded time `tr`. So, `t' = tr`.\n\nNext, we need the derivative `g'(t')`:\n$g'(t') = \\dfrac{d}{dt'} \\left( t' - t + \\frac{1}{c}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{c} \\dfrac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|$\nThe derivative of the magnitude is:\n$\\dfrac{d}{dt'}|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')| = \\dfrac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')) \\cdot (-\\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} = - \\dfrac{(\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t')|} \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') = - \\hat{d}(t') \\cdot \\vec{v}(t')$\nwhere `d` is the vector from `s(t')` to `r`, and `d_hat` is its unit vector.\n\nSo, `g'(t') = 1 - (d_hat(t') . v(t'))/c`.\nEvaluating this at `t' = tr`, and using the problem's notation (`d = r-s(tr)`, `d=|d|`, `v=v(tr)`):\n$|g'(t_r)| = 1 - \\dfrac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = 1 - \\dfrac{(\\vec{d}/d) \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}$\n\nNow we assemble the result for `V(r,t)`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{f(t')}{|g'(t')|} \\right]_{t'=t_r} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1/|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|}{(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/(dc)} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1/d}{(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})/(dc)}$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{dc}{d(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nA similar calculation for the vector potential `A` yields:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t) \\right]_{\\text{retarded}}$\nSubstituting the expression for `V`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relation `c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)`, we have `1/(\\epsilon_o c) = \\mu_o c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived potentials with the given options.\n\n*   `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n*   `\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`\n\nThese expressions exactly match the results in option A.\n\n*   **Option B** presents the Coulomb potential `V = q/(4πε₀r)` and relates `A` to it. The Coulomb potential is for a static charge and is an invalid form for a moving charge's potential, which must depend on the retarded position and velocity.\n*   **Option C** has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`). This corresponds to the advanced potentials, which are mathematically valid but physically rejected because they violate causality.\n*   **Option D** uses the incorrect static potential and a dimensionally incorrect form for `A`.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
