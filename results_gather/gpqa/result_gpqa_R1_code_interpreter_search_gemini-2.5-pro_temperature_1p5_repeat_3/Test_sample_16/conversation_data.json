    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that was prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:**\n    The problem involves the equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution. The complex can dissociate into its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA (we'll represent the fully deprotonated form as $Y^{4-}$). The reaction for this dissociation is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:**\n    The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is for the reverse reaction (dissociation) and is the reciprocal of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no free calcium or EDTA initially. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x:**\n    Now, we use the expression for the dissociation constant ($K_d$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n    Substituting the equilibrium values from the ICE table:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Make a Simplifying Approximation:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is extremely small. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the equation by assuming that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The simplified equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    Now, solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    Since x represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Verify the Approximation and Conclusion:**\n    The calculated value for x ($6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M) is indeed much, much smaller than 0.02 M, so our approximation was valid. Comparing our result to the given options:\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated concentration matches option D. The provided code output `6.32e-07` also confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
