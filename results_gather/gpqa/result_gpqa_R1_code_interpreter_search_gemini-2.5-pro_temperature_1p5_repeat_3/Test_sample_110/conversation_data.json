    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically hindered base.\n\n*   **Step 1: Enolate Formation**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   The C2 position is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3), so it has no α-protons.\n        *   The C6 position is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5), so it has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The enolate anion is nucleophilic at the C6 carbon.\n    *   This nucleophilic C6 attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group). Ethyl acrylate is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After the attack, a new enolate is formed on the acrylate moiety, which is then protonated (e.g., during aqueous workup) to give the final product.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product A**\n    *   The starting ketone (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one) is modified by the addition of a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group at the C6 position.\n    *   The resulting structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the naming convention in the options, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring. We need to number the ring for naming, starting from the point of attachment. Let's call the attachment carbon C1'.\n        *   The original C6 of the ketone is now C1'. It has a methyl group.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon, C=O) is now C2'. So, it is a 2'-oxo group.\n        *   The original C2 (with ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3'. It has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   So the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   Putting it all together, the IUPAC name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This structure for product A matches the one given in options **C** and **D**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction.\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n*   **Step 1: Nucleophile Formation**\n    *   The α-hydrogens of a nitroalkane (hydrogens on the carbon bearing the nitro group) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the C1 of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate anion: `[CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻`. This anion is the nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step 2: Michael Addition**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   An intermediate enolate/nitrile anion is formed, which is subsequently protonated by water.\n\n*   **Step 3: Structure and Naming of Product B**\n    *   The structure is formed by connecting the C1 of the 1-nitropropyl group to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)) - (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the CN group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   There is a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This structure for product B matches the one given in options **B** and **C**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates option D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
