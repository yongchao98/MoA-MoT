    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle.** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the populations of different energy levels as a function of temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation.** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level `j`) to the number of atoms in a lower state (level `i`):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in levels `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to the two stars.** The problem compares the excitation of the same type of atom (iron) in the same specific energy level for two different stars, star_1 and star_2. Let's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited level to the number of atoms in the ground state as `R`.\n\n    For star_1 (with temperature T_1):\n    R_1 = (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    For star_2 (with temperature T_2):\n    R_2 = (N_excited / N_ground)_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    The term `C = g_excited / g_ground` is the ratio of statistical weights. Since we are considering the same transition in the same atomic species, this term is the same for both stars. `ΔE` is also the same.\n\n4.  **Use the information given in the problem.** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio `R_1` is twice the ratio `R_2`:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Set up the equation and solve for the temperatures.** Substitute the expressions for `R_1` and `R_2` into this relationship:\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    The constant `C` cancels out from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we can isolate the exponential terms:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\n    Using the rule of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n    exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n6.  **Substitute the given numerical values.** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE` and we know the value of the Boltzmann constant `k`.\n    *   Given ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Now, let's compute the pre-factor `(ΔE / k)`:\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Although the value for an energy level difference is physically unrealistic (it's extremely small), we must use the numbers provided in the problem. The value appears to be chosen specifically to make this pre-factor equal to 1.\n\n7.  **Finalize the equation.** Substituting the value `(ΔE / k) = 1 K` into our derived equation:\n    ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    \n    The units on the right side are `K * (K / K²) = K / K`, which is dimensionless, matching the dimensionless nature of `ln(2)`. The equation simplifies to:\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options.** This result matches option B.\n    A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
