    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (a triplet means 2 adjacent protons).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (a doublet means 1 adjacent proton). This corresponds to the aldehyde proton. So, we have confirmed the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (benzene is ~7.3 ppm), which suggests the ring is substituted with an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen in the molecular formula and the electron-donating nature required to explain the upfield aromatic shifts confirm this assignment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CHO, -CH2-, 1,4-disubstituted benzene, -NH2), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Formula check: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. This matches.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n          H2N--[Benzene Ring]--CH2--CHO\n        ```\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The first set of reagents (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  The second reagent (H2O, often with gentle warming) is used to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   This two-step process effectively converts the amino group into a hydroxyl group.\n    *   **Product after Step 2:** **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        ```\n          HO--[Benzene Ring]--CH2--CHO\n        ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) in water, with heating.\n    *   The substrate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   These conditions (aldehyde with α-hydrogens + strong base + heat) are classic for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the Aldol Condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process:\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   Let's denote the 4-hydroxyphenyl group as Ar-OH. The reaction is:\n        Ar-OH-CH2-CHO  +  Ar-OH-CH2-CHO  --(KOH)-->  Ar-OH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar-OH)-CHO\n    *   The systematic name of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond. This is highly favorable as it creates a stable, conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde).\n    *   Ar-OH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar-OH)-CHO  --(Heat)-->  Ar-OH-CH2-CH=C(Ar-OH)-CHO + H2O\n    *   The systematic name of this final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the reaction is heated, the reaction will proceed to completion to form the more thermodynamically stable dehydrated product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the full aldol condensation.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
