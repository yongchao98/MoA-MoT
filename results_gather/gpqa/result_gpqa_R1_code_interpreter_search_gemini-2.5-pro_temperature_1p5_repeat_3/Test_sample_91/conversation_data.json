    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds. The given condensed formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Counting Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2**C**: 1 central carbon + 2 carbons in the methyl groups = 3\n    *   =**C**H-: 1 carbon\n    *   -**C**H2-: 1 carbon\n    *   -**C**H(**C**H3)-: 1 carbon in the chain + 1 carbon in the methyl group = 2\n    *   -**C**H2-: 1 carbon\n    *   -**C**H=: 1 carbon\n    *   =**C**(CH3)2: 1 central carbon + 2 carbons in the methyl groups = 3\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Counting Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (C**H3**)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   =C**H**-: 1\n    *   -C**H2**-: 2\n    *   -C**H**(C**H3**)-: 1 + 3 = 4\n    *   -C**H2**-: 2\n    *   -C**H**=: 1\n    *   =C(C**H3**)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22**\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\n\nWe need to count all the covalent bonds within the molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `C=C`.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can deduce the number of C-C single bonds. Let's trace the carbon skeleton:\n    *   (CH3)2C= : Two C-C bonds connecting the two methyl groups to the chain. (2 bonds)\n    *   =C-CH2- : One C-C bond. (1 bond)\n    *   -CH2-CH(- : One C-C bond. (1 bond)\n    *   -CH(CH3)- : One C-C bond for the methyl branch. (1 bond)\n    *   -CH-CH2- : One C-C bond. (1 bond)\n    *   -CH2-CH= : One C-C bond. (1 bond)\n    *   =C(CH3)2 : Two C-C bonds connecting the two methyl groups. (2 bonds)\n    *   **Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9**\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   22 × (C-H)\n*   9 × (C-C)\n*   2 × (C=C)\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following formula, based on Hess's Law:\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\n    The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n    The reactants must be converted to gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n    *   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the product (C12H22).**\n    This is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in one mole of the product.\n    *   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * (BE of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * (BE of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * (BE of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   **Total bond energy of the product = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate ΔHf in kJ/mol.**\n    *   ΔHf = (13100 kJ/mol) - (11200 kJ/mol) = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Convert the Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g or kJ/mol. Our calculated answer is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check if this value or its kJ/g equivalent matches any option.\n\n*   **Calculate the molar mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol** (using integer masses as the given data is simplified).\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf from kJ/mol to kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value is correct for kJ/mol, but the unit is wrong.)\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculation perfectly.)\nD) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy of the product, a common distractor.)\n\nThe correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n```python\n# Values from the problem statement\nH_atom_C = 1000      # Enthalpy of atomization of carbon in kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100          # Bond energy of H-H in kJ/mol\nBE_CC = 200          # Bond energy of C-C in kJ/mol\nBE_C_double_C = 300  # Bond energy of C=C in kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400          # Bond energy of C-H in kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Stoichiometry from molecular formula C12H22\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H_atoms / 2\n\n# Step 2: Enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g))\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C_atoms * H_atom_C) + (num_H2_molecules * BE_HH)\n\n# Step 3: Total bond energy of the product molecule C12H22\n# Bond counts determined from the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_double_C_bonds = 2\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + (num_CC_bonds * BE_CC) + (num_C_double_C_bonds * BE_C_double_C)\n\n# Step 4: Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol\ndelta_H_f_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 5: Conversion to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 = 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1\ndelta_H_f_gram = delta_H_f_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(delta_H_f_gram)\n```\n\n11.44578313253012\n\n<<<C>>>",
