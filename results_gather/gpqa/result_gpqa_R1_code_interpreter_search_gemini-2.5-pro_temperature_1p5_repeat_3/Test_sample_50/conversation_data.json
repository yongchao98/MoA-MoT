    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere are identical to the field and potential that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image\" charge `q'` placed inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is replaced by this image charge in the model.\n\n1.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:**\n\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the origin.\n    *   The grounded sphere has a potential of zero. The image charge `q'` and its position `d'` must be chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n    *   Through standard derivation, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are found to be:\n        *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, along the same line as `q`). Since `d > R`, `d'` will be less than `R`, so the image charge is inside the sphere.\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`. The image charge has the opposite sign to the original charge.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the attraction of the grounded sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let the charge `q` be at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center as it is brought in from infinity (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n    *   At this position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `x' = R^2/x`.\n    *   The force `F(x)` on the charge `q` due to the image charge `q'(x)` is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * 1 / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n        `F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R) / x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        `F(x) = - k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        This is the attractive force on charge `q`.\n\n    *   The work done `W` by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d` is the integral of the external force `F_ext = -F(x)`:\n        `U = W = integral(F_ext dx) from ∞ to d = - integral(F(x) dx) from ∞ to d`\n        `U = - integral_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * integral_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n    *   To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du / 2`.\n        `integral [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = integral [1 / u^2] (du/2) = (1/2) * integral(u^-2 du) = (1/2) * (-u^-1) = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    *   Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `x = ∞` to `x = d`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - 0]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   Alternatively, the energy can be found using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the position of `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. This potential is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d') = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
