    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula is given by:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area for a collision to occur. A larger cross-section means a higher probability of collision and thus a shorter mean free path.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ1: The MFP of Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   This scenario describes gas molecules colliding with each other.\n*   In the kinetic theory of gases, when considering the motion of all particles, the formula is slightly modified to account for the relative motion between the colliding molecules.\n*   **Formula for λ1:** λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is essentially determined by the physical size (kinetic diameter) of the molecules. For example, σ_gg ≈ πd², where 'd' is the molecular diameter.\n\n### **3. Analyze λ2: The MFP of Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   This scenario describes a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n*   In this case, the gas molecules can be considered almost stationary compared to the extremely high-speed electrons (accelerated at 1000 kV, their speed is close to the speed of light). Therefore, the √2 factor (which accounts for target motion) is not used.\n*   **Formula for λ2:** λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   The crucial difference between λ₁ and λ₂ lies in their respective collision cross-sections.\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is a \"kinetic\" or \"geometric\" cross-section. It's relatively large because it's based on the physical size of the electron shells of the molecules.\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This is a \"scattering\" cross-section. An electron is a fundamental point-like particle. A \"collision\" in this context is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) that significantly deflects the electron from its path. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV), the probability of such an interaction with a light gas atom (like N₂ or O₂) is very low. The electron is moving so fast that it often passes through the atomic electron cloud with negligible interaction. The effective target for the electron is much, much smaller than the physical size of the gas molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** The electron-gas scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section.\n    *   **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### **5. Conclude the Relationship between λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   We have:\n    *   λ₁ ∝ 1 / (√2 * σ_gg)\n    *   λ₂ ∝ 1 / σ_eg\n*   Since `σ_eg` is much smaller than `σ_gg`, its inverse (`1/σ_eg`) will be much larger than the inverse of `σ_gg`.\n*   Therefore, λ₂ will be much larger than λ₁.\n    *   **λ₂ >> λ₁**\n\n### **6. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation:** Incorrect. The physics dictates they must be different.\n*   **B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁:** Incorrect. This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. Our analysis shows λ₂ should be *much* larger.\n*   **C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁:** This is the only option that aligns with our conclusion that **λ₂ > λ₁**. Although the actual ratio λ₂/λ₁ is expected to be much greater than 1.22, this statement is mathematically and physically correct because it establishes the correct relationship (λ₂ is larger than λ₁) and provides a lower bound.\n*   **D) λ₂ < λ₁:** Incorrect. This would imply that an electron is *more* likely to collide with a gas molecule than another gas molecule is, which is contrary to the physics of high-energy scattering.\n\nThe final conclusion is that the mean free path for the high-energy electrons (λ₂) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ₁).\n\n<<<C>>>"
