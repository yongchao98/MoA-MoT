    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a system of two astronauts with different masses and relativistic speeds, moving in the same direction. We need to calculate two quantities:\n*   The relative speed between the two astronauts.\n*   The total energy of the system as observed from a stationary reference frame.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$): 2m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$): 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$): 3m\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$): 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   c: speed of light\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the velocities are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. Let's find the velocity of astronaut 1 as observed from the reference frame of astronaut 2.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts, as measured in the initial stationary frame.\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**Energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   $m_1 = 2m$\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Calculate $\\gamma_1$:\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Calculate $E_1$:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   $m_2 = 3m$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Calculate $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Calculate $E_2$:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nNow, calculate the numerical value of the coefficient $(2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3})$. We can use a calculator for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n# Calculate the coefficient for the total energy\ntotal_energy_coeff = 2.5 + 2 * math.sqrt(3)\nprint(f\"{total_energy_coeff=:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\ntotal_energy_coeff=5.9641\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation gives approximately 5.9641.\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy: $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to apply the principles of special relativity to calculate the relative speed between two objects and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, we would simply subtract the velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). However, at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. The formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) of an object moving at velocity $v_1$ with respect to an observer moving at velocity $v_2$ in the same direction is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts as measured from a stationary reference frame.\n\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**For astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass, $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy, $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass, $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n*   Energy, $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy:**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 2 \\times 1.732) mc^2 = (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
