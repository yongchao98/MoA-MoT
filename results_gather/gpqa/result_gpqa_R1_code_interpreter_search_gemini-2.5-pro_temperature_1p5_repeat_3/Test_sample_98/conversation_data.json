    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1\" rule states that a proton signal is split into n+1 lines by n equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being coupled by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **q**uartet, 3+1=4 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a proton is coupled to:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving a **d**oublet, 1+1=2 lines).\n        *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving a **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n        *   Another different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (giving another **t**riplet, 2+1=3 lines).\n    *   For this to occur, a methine proton (-CH-) must be adjacent to another methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a second, non-equivalent methylene group (-CH₂-).\n\nThe problem states that the compound's spectrum contains **both** of these signals. We must find the molecule that has two different protons matching these descriptions.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's draw and analyze the structure for each option, numbering the carbon chain starting from the carboxylic acid carbon (C1).\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n         Et   Et\n         |    |\nC₅H₃-C₄H₂-C₃H--C₂H--C₁OOH\n```\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the -CH₂- of its ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). **Signal: dt**.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, gives doublet), the -CH₂- at C4 (2H, gives triplet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). **Signal: dtt**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule shows a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n       Me   Me\n       |    |\nC₅H₃-C₄H₂-C₃H--C₂H--C₁OOH\n```\n*   **H at C2:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the methyl group at C2 (3H, gives quartet). **Signal: dq**.\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C2 (1H, gives doublet), the -CH₂- at C4 (2H, gives triplet), and the methyl group at C3 (3H, gives quartet). **Signal: dqt**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule shows a `dqt` (same as `dtq`) but not a `dtt`. Incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n       Me   Me\n       |    |\nC₅H₃--C₄H--C₃H--C₂H₂--C₁OOH\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Coupled to H at C4 (1H, gives doublet), the -CH₂- at C2 (2H, gives triplet), and the methyl group at C3 (3H, gives quartet). **Signal: dqt**.\n*   **H at C4:** Coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives doublet), the methyl group at C5 (3H, gives quartet), and the methyl group at C4 (3H, gives quartet). **Signal: dqq**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule shows a `dqt` but not a `dtt`. Incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n*Note: The condensed formula in the option `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` represents 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid when assembled logically.*\n```\n       Et   Et\n       |    |\nC₅H₃--C₄H--C₃H--C₂H₂--C₁OOH\n```\nLet's analyze the two key methine protons:\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-C3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H) → **d**oublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the methylene (-CH₂-) group at C2 (2H) → **t**riplet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the methylene (-CH₂-) group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H) → **t**riplet.\n    *   **Signal for H-C3: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-C4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H) → **d**oublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the methylene (-CH₂-) group of the ethyl substituent at C4 (2H) → **t**riplet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group at C5 (3H) → **q**uartet.\n    *   **Signal for H-C4: doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has protons that produce **both** the `dtt` and `dtq` signals described.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is consistent with all the provided data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
