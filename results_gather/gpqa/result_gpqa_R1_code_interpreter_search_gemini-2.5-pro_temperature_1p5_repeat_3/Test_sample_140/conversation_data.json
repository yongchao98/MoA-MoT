    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products in the given reaction.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where a bromine (Br) atom is at position C1 and a deuterium (D) atom is at position C2. The other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). This is a very strong base (amide ion, NH₂⁻) used in a polar solvent.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe strong base (NH₂⁻) abstracts an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C2:** This position is occupied by a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Position C6:** This position is occupied by a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe base can abstract either the H from C6 or the D from C2, leading to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This forms a **deuterated benzyne intermediate**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuterium (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion.\n    2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This forms a **non-deuterated benzyne intermediate** (regular benzyne).\n\n*   **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is kinetically favored and occurs faster than Pathway B (abstraction of D). However, both pathways are possible and will occur.\n\n**4. Step 2: Addition (Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The attack can occur at either carbon atom of the benzyne \"triple bond\".\n\n*   **Addition to the Deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C1. A negative charge forms on C6, which is then protonated by the ammonia solvent. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group attaches to C6. A negative charge forms on C1, which is protonated. The resulting product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Thus, Pathway A produces **two different deuterated products**.\n\n*   **Addition to the Non-deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    *   This intermediate is simply benzyne, with a triple bond between C1 and C2 and no deuterium.\n    *   The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2. Regardless of where it attacks, the subsequent protonation results in the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n    *   Thus, Pathway B produces **one non-deuterated product**.\n\n**5. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible initial elimination pathways, we identify three unique organic products that can be formed:\n\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
