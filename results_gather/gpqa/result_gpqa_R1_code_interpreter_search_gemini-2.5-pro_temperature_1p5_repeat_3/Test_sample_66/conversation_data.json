    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, and its state is described in the coupled angular momentum basis. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:** The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for both electrons, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled basis state $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:** The probability of finding the system in the state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ when it is initially in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection (inner product) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Probability $P = | <(l_1=1, m_1=-1), (l_2=1, m_2=-1) | (l_1=1, l_2=1, l=2, m=-1)> |^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component quantum number, $m$, must be the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Apply the Conservation Rule to the Problem:**\n    *   For the initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total z-component quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the state is $|1, -1>|1, -1>$. For this state, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result:** The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum quantum number $m = -1$. The state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{outcome} = -2$.\n    Since $m \\neq m_{outcome}$, the state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ cannot be a component of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\n7.  **Formal Justification (Orthogonality):** The total z-component angular momentum operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The outcome state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n    *   Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) that correspond to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, the inner product is zero: $<(1,-1),(1,-1) | (1,1,2,-1)> = 0$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Probability:** The probability is the square of the inner product.\n    *   $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
