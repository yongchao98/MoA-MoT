    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Number of stars in a volume:** The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is given by `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Relating Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The fundamental relation is `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Note: For simplicity, we assume units are chosen appropriately (e.g., `d` in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Consider a Shell of Stars:** Let's find the number of stars `dN` located at a specific distance. We can do this by considering a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and an infinitesimal thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin spherical shell `dV` is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area of Sphere) * (thickness)`\n        `dV = (4πd²) * dd`\n\n5.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` within this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n6.  **Express everything in terms of Parallax (`plx`):** The question asks for the relationship with parallax, so we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship between the infinitesimals: `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can use `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n7.  **Substitute into the `dN` equation:** Now we replace `d` and `dd` in our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is precisely the term `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation in the previous step, we can rearrange to find this quantity:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `(Number of stars per unit parallax range) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result means that the number of stars found in a small, fixed-size parallax interval drops very steeply as the parallax itself gets larger (i.e., as we look at closer stars).\n\n<<<D>>>"
