    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This is a strong clue that we are dealing with deuterium. Normal water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0 °C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine possible diatomic gases related to the context:\n    *   H₂ (molecular hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (molecular deuterium): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (p = n).\n    This confirms that the gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, both the reagent (X) and the protic solvent it reacts with (Y) must contain only deuterium, not protium (normal hydrogen). Therefore, liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O). Substance X must be a deuterated reagent. The problem mentions X and its analog are used in organic chemistry and that the reaction is violent. This points towards a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The two most common are Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n4.  **Differentiate between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄:** The reaction between X and Y (D₂O) forms a precipitate G. Let's write the reactions:\n    *   `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    *   `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    Sodium borate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate forms. However, aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will precipitate. This means G is Al(OD)₃, and **Substance X must be LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify with other clues:**\n    *   **Heating G:** The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃. When heated, metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose. `2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g)`. This releases substance B, which we identified as D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   **Keto acid reaction:** The problem states \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It can reduce both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A typical α-keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH (containing 3 oxygen atoms). LiAlD₄ would reduce it to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This is also consistent.\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must sum the mass of the single Aluminium atom and the four Deuterium atoms in the LiAlD₄ molecule.\n    *   Since the answer options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The isotope Deuterium is ²H, with a mass number of 2.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
