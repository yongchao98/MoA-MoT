    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's break down the name to draw its structure:\n    *   **nona**: The main carbon chain has 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   **-2,6-diene**: There are two double bonds in the chain, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   **5-butyl**: A butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    Let's number the carbon chain from left to right:\n    CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n\n    This structure can be represented as:\n    `CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(C₄H₉)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    The reactant, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, contains a 1,5-diene system. The sequence of bonds C=C-C-C-C=C is present in the backbone (from C2 to C7). When a 1,5-diene is heated, it undergoes a characteristic pericyclic reaction known as the **Cope rearrangement**, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift.\n\n3.  **Understand the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    In a Cope rearrangement, a 1,5-diene rearranges by breaking the sigma bond between carbons 3 and 4 (in the generic 1,5-diene numbering) and forming a new sigma bond between carbons 1 and 6, while the two pi bonds shift their positions.\n\n    Let's apply this to our molecule. The 1,5-diene system is composed of atoms C2 through C7 of the nonane chain.\n    *   Generic atom 1 corresponds to C7.\n    *   Generic atom 2 corresponds to C6.\n    *   Generic atom 3 corresponds to C5.\n    *   Generic atom 4 corresponds to C4.\n    *   Generic atom 5 corresponds to C3.\n    *   Generic atom 6 corresponds to C2.\n\n    The rearrangement involves:\n    *   **Breaking** the sigma bond between C4 and C5.\n    *   **Forming** a new sigma bond between C2 and C7.\n    *   **Shifting** the pi bond from C2=C3 to C3=C4.\n    *   **Shifting** the pi bond from C6=C7 to C5=C6.\n\n4.  **Construct the Product Structure:**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule. We can build the new structure fragment by fragment:\n    *   The bond between C4 and C5 is broken. C4 was -CH₂-, and it becomes part of a new double bond with C3. It is now a terminal `CH₂=` group.\n    *   C3 was -CH=, and it's now single-bonded to C2 and double-bonded to C4. So it becomes `-CH=CH₂`.\n    *   C2 was `CH₃-CH=`. It is now single-bonded to C3, C1(methyl group), and the newly connected C7. So it becomes a `-CH(CH₃)-` unit in the new chain.\n    *   C7 was `=CH-CH₂CH₃`. It is now single-bonded to C6, C8(ethyl group), and the newly connected C2. So it becomes a `-CH(CH₂CH₃)-` unit.\n    *   C6 was `-CH=`. It is now single-bonded to C7 and double-bonded to C5. Its hydrogen atom remains, so it becomes a `=CH-` unit.\n    *   C5 was `-CH(C₄H₉)-`. It is now double-bonded to C6. Its hydrogen and butyl group remain attached. It becomes a `=C(C₄H₉)(H)` unit.\n\n    Now, let's assemble these pieces. The new sigma bond links C2 and C7.\n    The resulting molecule's backbone can be drawn as:\n    `CH₂=CH - CH(CH₃) - CH(CH₂CH₃) - CH=C(H)(C₄H₉)`\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    To name the product, we need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the two double bonds).\n    *   The chain starts with `CH₂=CH-`, passes through the substituted `CH-CH` bridge, and continues through the second double bond `=CH-C(H)(C₄H₉)`.\n    *   To find the longest chain, we must include the four carbons from the butyl group.\n    *   The main chain is: `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH(5)=C(6)-C(7)-C(8)-C(9)-C(10)`\n    *   Let's draw this out with the substituents:\n            CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n            |     |\n      `CH₂=CH--CH--CH--CH=C(H)--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH₃`\n\n    Now, we name this structure according to IUPAC rules:\n    *   **Main chain**: 10 carbons long, so it's a \"deca-\" derivative.\n    *   **Functional groups**: Two double bonds starting at C1 and C5. So it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   **Substituents**: There is a methyl group (-CH₃) on C3 and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) on C4.\n    *   **Assembling the name**: Alphabetize the substituents (ethyl before methyl). The full name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check the given choices:\n    A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    C) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (duplicate of A)\n    D) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
