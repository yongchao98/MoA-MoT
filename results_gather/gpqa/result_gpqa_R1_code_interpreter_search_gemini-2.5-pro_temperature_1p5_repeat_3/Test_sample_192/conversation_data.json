    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, as:\n    `N ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\n    This `N` represents the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For a star at distance `r`, its parallax `plx` is given by:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice-versa. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars with parallax `≥ plx` is the same as the cumulative number of stars with distance `≤ r`.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** We can substitute the distance relationship into the given star count formula. Let `N(r)` be the number of stars within a distance `r`.\n\n    `N(r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N(r) ∝ r^5`\n\n    This tells us that the total number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with `r`. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative:** We differentiate the relationship `N(r) ∝ r^5` with respect to `r`.\n    Let `N(r) = C * r^5`, where `C` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (C * r^5)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * C * r^4`\n\n6.  **Find the Final Proportionality:** From the differentiation, we see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:** Comparing our result with the given choices:\n    A) ~ r^5\n    B) ~ r^2\n    C) ~ r^4\n    D) ~ r^3\n\n    The calculated relationship `~ r^4` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
