    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data are key.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The starting material, Compound X, is C₁₁H₁₂O. Since the reaction is described as a rearrangement (isomerization), the product will have the same molecular formula, C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C₁₁H₁₂O is calculated as: DoU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone or an aldehyde.\n    *   There are eight signals in the **δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm** range, which corresponds to sp² hybridized carbons (alkenes and aromatic rings). The note that two signals account for two carbons each (126.9 (2C) and 129.1 (2C)) means there are a total of 8 sp² carbons.\n    *   Signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic sp³ carbon region, corresponding to two methyl groups.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two separate signals, each integrating to 3 protons and appearing as a singlet. This indicates two methyl (-CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, are characteristic of two protons on a double bond (vinyl protons) that are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  The para-substituted benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons and 4 protons (C₆H₄). One of the CH₃ singlets (e.g., δ 2.31) and one of the aliphatic ¹³C signals (e.g., δ 21.3) must be a methyl group attached to this ring. This forms a *para*-tolyl group (p-Me-C₆H₄-). This fragment accounts for C₇H₇ of the formula and fits the aromatic NMR signals.\n    2.  The remaining atoms are C₄H₅O.\n    3.  We have a ketone group (C=O, δ 197.7), another methyl group (-CH₃, δ 2.28), and a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-, δ 6.75 and δ 7.68).\n    4.  Assembling these remaining pieces gives an enone fragment: -CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    5.  Connecting the *p*-tolyl group to this fragment gives the final structure:\n        **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n\n        `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\n    6.  This structure perfectly matches all the NMR data and has the correct formula, C₁₁H₁₂O. The DoU is 6 (benzene ring=4, C=C=1, C=O=1).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Starting Materials**\n\nNow that we know the product, we can work backward to identify the starting material, Compound X. The reaction is an isomerization of X to the product. Therefore, X must be an isomer of 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one and must contain a *p*-tolyl group.\n\nLet's examine the options provided for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a *phenyl* group (C₆H₅-), not a *p*-tolyl group. An isomerization cannot add a methyl group to the ring. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** A \"styryl\" group is phenylvinyl (C₆H₅-CH=CH-). This compound also contains a *phenyl* group. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This name is ambiguous but also implies a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** A \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`. This compound contains the required *p*-tolyl group and has the correct molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O. It is a vinyl epoxide. This is the only plausible starting material.\n\n**3. The Reaction Mechanism (Confirmation)**\n\nThe reaction transforms 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane into 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is a known type of vinyl epoxide rearrangement.\n\n*   **Starting Material (X):** `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` (This is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)\n*   **Product:** `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\nA plausible mechanism catalyzed by the base (DABCO) is as follows:\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The base removes the acidic proton on the carbon adjacent to both the vinyl group and the epoxide oxygen.\n    `...-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂ + Base ⇌ ...-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH₂ + Base-H⁺`\n2.  **Rearrangement:** The resulting anion rearranges in an elimination-like step. The negative charge forms a C=O double bond, cleaving the C-O bond and placing a negative charge on the terminal carbon.\n    `...-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH₂ → ...-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂⁻`\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting carbanion is rapidly protonated (e.g., by the `Base-H⁺` formed in step 1) to yield the final ketone product.\n    `...-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂⁻ + Base-H⁺ → ...-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃ + Base`\n\nThis mechanism explains the transformation from the vinyl epoxide in option D to the product deduced from the NMR spectra.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the product of the reaction is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material listed that has the correct atoms (specifically, a *p*-tolyl group) to form this product via isomerization is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
