    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the flux variation due to stellar spots.**\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted hemisphere. We need to calculate the amplitude of this change. The flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to its projected area and the fourth power of its effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: F ∝ A * T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, T_eff.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴`\n    where A_disk is the projected area of the star's disk (πR_star²).\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The problem states this hemisphere has a spot filling factor `f` of 20% (or 0.2). This means 20% of the visible disk is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining 80% (1-f) has the normal effective temperature.\n    *   Temperature of spots: T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part of the disk.\n    `F_min ∝ (1-f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux from the maximum.\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    Amplitude = `(A_disk * T_eff⁴ - [(1-f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]) / (A_disk * T_eff⁴)`\n    By canceling out `A_disk`, we get:\n    Amplitude = `(T_eff⁴ - (1-f) * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    Amplitude = `(T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    Amplitude = `(f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    Amplitude = `f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)`\n    Amplitude = `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the numerical value of the amplitude.**\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 = 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness drops by about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere is visible.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the amplitude to a transiting exoplanet.**\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude signal if it transited a non-spotted version of the star. The dip in brightness caused by a transiting planet (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's projected area (A_pl) to the star's projected area (A_star).\n\nTransit Depth = `A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**Step 4: Equate the spot amplitude and the transit depth to find the planet's relative radius.**\n\nWe set the two amplitudes to be equal:\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot properties from the problem\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0 # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20         # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# --- Part 1: Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation due to spots ---\n# The formula for the amplitude (relative flux drop) is: f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\nspot_amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# --- Part 2: Relate this amplitude to a transiting exoplanet ---\n# The transit depth (amplitude) is given by (R_planet / R_star)**2\n# We set the spot amplitude equal to the transit depth to find the required planet size.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = spot_amplitude\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\nrelative_planet_radius = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\n# Print the final result rounded to a few decimal places\nprint(f\"{relative_planet_radius:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>0.32\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.32. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem requires us to equate the drop in brightness caused by stellar spots with the drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the brightness drop due to stellar spots:**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). We need to find the relative flux difference between the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n    *   `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. 20% (f=0.2) of the surface is covered by cooler spots, and the remaining 80% (1-f=0.8) has the normal effective temperature.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool parts: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The relative drop in brightness is calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   `Amplitude_spot = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   `= (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   `= (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   `= f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   `Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n*   `Amplitude_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n*   `Amplitude_spot ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n*   `Amplitude_spot ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the brightness drops by about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere is visible.\n\n**2. Calculate the equivalent exoplanet size:**\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe need this amplitude to be the same as the one caused by the spots.\n\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spot ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root:\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32. The code execution confirms this calculation, yielding an output of `0.32`.\n\nComparing our result to the options provided:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
