    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Possible Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, let's assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two required carbon atoms.\n*   A very common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**. It has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO.\n*   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. (Correct)\n*   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). It is di-substituted. (Correct)\n*   Functional Groups: It has an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group. (Correct)\n*   Total Protons: The benzene ring has 4 protons (C₆H₄), and the methyl group has 3 protons (-CH₃). The total is 4 + 3 = 7 protons.\n\nAnother possibility could be a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond. We will evaluate the NMR data for both possibilities.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nThe correct 1H NMR spectrum must account for 7 protons and match the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for our proposed structure(s). Aromatic protons typically appear in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** The chemical shifts at δ 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons. Only one aromatic proton (1H) is listed. This is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring which must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at δ 4.6-4.8 are not characteristic of aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: Correct region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: A pattern of two doublets (each 2H) is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: Plausible region for the methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Splitting Error:** However, in the structure X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO, the methylene (-CH₂) protons are adjacent to the aldehyde (-CHO) proton. Due to spin-spin coupling, they must split each other's signals. The -CH₂- signal should be a **doublet**, and the -CHO signal should be a **triplet**. The data incorrectly lists them both as **singlets (s)**. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**.\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield into the correct range.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the characteristic signal for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH**₃**). It is a **singlet (s)** because it is not adjacent to any other protons. The chemical shift around δ 2.3-2.6 ppm is expected.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone, a molecule that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option C contains an error in the splitting pattern that makes it inconsistent with its corresponding structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
