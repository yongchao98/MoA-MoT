    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The question is about distinguishing two energy levels (E1 and E2) which have finite lifetimes. The finite lifetime of a quantum state introduces an inherent uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is described by the **Heisenberg's Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle**.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Principle:** The time-energy uncertainty principle is given by the formula:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n    For practical calculations, especially in problems like this, we can use the approximation:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n    Here, ΔE represents the \"natural linewidth\" or energy spread of the quantum state, and Δt is its lifetime (τ).\n\n3.  **Define \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties.\n    Let ΔE1 be the energy uncertainty for the state with lifetime τ1, and ΔE2 for τ2.\n    The condition for resolvability is: |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2).\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of the first state, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   Lifetime of the second state, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainties (Linewidths):**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. It's more convenient to use it in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) since the options are in eV.\n        *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   Calculate ΔE1 for the first state:\n        ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   Calculate ΔE2 for the second state:\n        ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n6.  **Apply the Resolvability Condition:**\n    *   We need to find the larger of the two uncertainties: max(ΔE1, ΔE2).\n    *   Comparing ΔE1 (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) and ΔE2 (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV), it is clear that ΔE1 is the larger uncertainty. This makes sense, as the state with the *shorter* lifetime has the *larger* energy uncertainty.\n    *   Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is: |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    We need to find which of the given options satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV:  10⁻⁹ is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷. Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV:  10⁻⁴ is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷. Clearly resolvable.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV:  10⁻⁸ is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷. Not resolvable.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: 10⁻¹¹ is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷. Not resolvable.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference that is large enough to allow the two states to be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo verify the precise numerical values, I will use a Python script.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV.s\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The condition for the levels to be resolved is that their energy difference\n# must be larger than the largest of their individual energy uncertainties.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (τ = {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (τ = {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"To be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than: {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The provided options\noption_A = 1e-9\noption_B = 1e-4\noption_C = 1e-8\noption_D = 1e-11\n\nprint(f\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nprint(f\"Is Option A ({option_A} eV) > {required_separation:.3e} eV? {option_A > required_separation}\")\nprint(f\"Is Option B ({option_B} eV) > {required_separation:.3e} eV? {option_B > required_separation}\")\nprint(f\"Is Option C ({option_C} eV) > {required_separation:.3e} eV? {option_C > required_separation}\")\nprint(f\"Is Option D ({option_D} eV) > {required_separation:.3e} eV? {option_D > required_separation}\")\n\n```\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (τ = 1e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (τ = 1e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than: 6.582e-07 eV\n\nChecking the options:\nIs Option A (1e-09 eV) > 6.582e-07 eV?

    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Formulation**\n\n*   **Principle:** The core concept is the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is approximately ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ (the reduced Planck constant).\n*   **Interpretation:** This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is often called the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. It's not a single, sharp value but rather a small range of energies.\n*   **Resolvability Condition:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their energy uncertainties. A common criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the half-widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2) / 2, or more simply, greater than the larger of the two individual linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, so that's the one we need to focus on.\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   **Constant:** The reduced Planck constant, ħ, in electron-volt-seconds is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state.**\n    *   ΔE = ħ / τ\n    *   For the first state: ΔE1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the second state: ΔE2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n2.  **Determine the minimum required energy separation.**\n    *   The state with the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1 = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n    *   To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than this larger uncertainty.\n    *   So, we need |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV:**  This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  This is much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Clearly resolvable.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:**  This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nThe code execution confirmed these calculations. It found that the required separation must be greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV and that only option B (10⁻⁴ eV) satisfies this condition.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n<<<B>>>"
