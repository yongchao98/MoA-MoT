    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity:** In this system, the total energy is conserved. The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n    $E_{total} = K + U(x) = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Define the kinetic and potential energies:**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n        $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\n        where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F = -kx$) is:\n        $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n        where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at two specific points in the oscillation:**\n    *   **At the point of maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        At $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $K = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        Therefore, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:**\n    The total energy must be the same at both points. So, we equate the two expressions for $E_{total}$:\n    $E_{total}(x=A) = E_{total}(x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$:**\n    First, solve the equation for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we rearrange the equation. First, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max}^2 = c^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} \\right)$\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
