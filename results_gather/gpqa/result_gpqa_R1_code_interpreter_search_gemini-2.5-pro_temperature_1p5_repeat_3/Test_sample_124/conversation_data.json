    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, this potential corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means the restoring force is the same in all directions, so the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The energy levels of a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the i-th direction (i = x, y, z).\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_x + E_y + E_z = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, ...$). The energy levels can then be written as:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$. Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$. Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$. Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$. Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of distinct combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that yield the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ that sum to 3.\n\n    This can be found using the degeneracy formula for an n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    Alternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x+n_y+n_z=3$:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) --- (3 states)\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) --- (6 states)\n    *   The combination (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy level $E_3$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. Let's check the given options:\n    A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\n    B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\n    C) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n    D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\n    Option B matches our findings perfectly. The energy expression in options C and D is incorrect for a harmonic oscillator; it resembles the energy levels for a particle in an infinite spherical well.\n\n<<<B>>>"
