    "This problem requires understanding the behavior of fermions in a quantum system, specifically within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Key Principle:** Fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum States:** For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up, ↑) or `-1/2` (spin down, ↓).\n\n### **2. Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy for the `n`-th level simplifies to:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n*   Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n### **3. Calculation of State Energies**\n\nWe need to find the total energy of the system for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state by filling the energy levels with the four fermions according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n#### **Ground State ($E_{gs}$)**\n\nTo achieve the ground state (the state of minimum possible energy), we fill the lowest available energy levels.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** We place two fermions (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n2.  **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two fermions (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    $E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n#### **First Excited State ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n1.  **Promotion:** In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3. We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n2.  **New Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles (Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$)\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle (Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times 4E = 4E$)\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle (Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times 3^2 E = 9E$)\n\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n#### **Second Excited State ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state and find the one with the lowest energy.\n\n*   **Possibility 1: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 3: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
