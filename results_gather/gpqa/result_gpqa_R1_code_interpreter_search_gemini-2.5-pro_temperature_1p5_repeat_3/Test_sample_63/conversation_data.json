    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated, producing only a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the effect on each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The mass did not change, which means no such acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) trapped by Cu = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The source of this oxygen could be O₂ gas (reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO) or an oxygen-containing gas like nitrous oxide, N₂O (reaction: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂). Both scenarios involve 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms being transferred.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas passed through all tubes unreacted, it must be inert. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is a very likely candidate.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of the Salts**\n\nLet's work backward from the products to identify the original salts.\nThe decomposition produced H, N, and O atoms. This means salts A and B must be compounds containing these elements. The fact that they decompose completely into gases suggests they might be ammonium salts.\n\nLet's consider two plausible chemical scenarios for the decomposition. Both lead to the same answer.\n\n**Scenario A (Decomposition to N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is O₂.\n*   Moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol, so moles of O₂ molecules = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   The gas mixture produced was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂ (Gas C).\n*   The molar ratio of products is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20. Dividing by 0.025 gives a simple integer ratio of **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\n**Scenario B (Decomposition to N₂, N₂O, H₂O - Chemically more likely at 200°C):**\nThis scenario assumes the gas reacting with Cu is N₂O.\n*   The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To trap 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of the N₂ from this reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was initially produced and passed through Tube 3 unreacted.\n*   Initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n*   So, the original gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.05 mol N₂O.\n\n**3. Test the Hypothesized Salts**\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) ** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** fits our data.\n\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (at ~200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet the equimolar amount of each salt in the initial mixture be 'n' moles.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n moles\n*   Total N₂O = n moles\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nNow, we match this with the products derived in Scenario B:\n*   Total N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol\n\nThe results match perfectly. Thus, the mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass matches the value given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃ is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
