    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence and Identify Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Step 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C to form Product 1.\n        *   The IR spectrum of Product 1 shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n        *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 1 is given. The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂), also has 14 hydrogens. Assuming the reaction involves substituting the two Br atoms with one O atom, the formula for Product 1 is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n    *   **Step 2:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide to form Product 2.\n        *   This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction reduces a ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). So, Product 2 is the alcohol corresponding to the ketone in Product 1.\n\n    *   **Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n        *   This two-step process is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n        *   The fact that this reaction occurs proves that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**.\n        *   Since Product 2 is formed by a simple reduction of Product 1, **Product 1 must also contain a C=C double bond**.\n        *   Therefore, Product 1 is an unsaturated ketone.\n\n2.  **Determine the Nature of the C=C Bond:**\n    *   We need to determine what kind of aldehyde or ketone is formed upon ozonolysis to identify the most deshielded proton in Product 3. The ozonolysis products depend on the substitution pattern of the alkene in Product 2:\n        *   `R-CH=CH-R'` → `R-CHO` + `R'-CHO` (two aldehydes)\n        *   `R₂C=CH-R'` → `R₂C=O` + `R'-CHO` (a ketone and an aldehyde)\n        *   `R₂C=CH₂` → `R₂C=O` + `CH₂O` (a ketone and formaldehyde)\n        *   `R₂C=CR'₂` → `R₂C=O` + `R'₂C=O` (two ketones)\n    *   The question asks for the coupling pattern of the *most deshielded* non-exchangeable proton in Product 3. Aldehyde protons (`-CHO`) are extremely deshielded, appearing at δ = 9-10 ppm. If Product 3 contained an aldehyde group, its proton would be the most deshielded one.\n    *   However, let's look at the ¹H NMR data for Product 1 again: `4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)`. The signal at 4.79 ppm integrates to 2H. A C=C double bond with two protons on it could be `-CH=CH-` or `C=CH₂`. In a `-CH=CH-` system within a complex, asymmetric molecule, the two protons are unlikely to be chemically equivalent and have the same chemical shift. A signal for two equivalent protons in the vinylic region is most characteristic of a terminal methylene group, `C=CH₂`.\n    *   Assuming the alkene is a `C=CH₂` group, ozonolysis of Product 2 (`...C=CH₂`) would yield a ketone (`...C=O`) and formaldehyde (`CH₂O`).\n    *   In this scenario, **Product 3 does not contain an aldehyde group**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton in Product 3:**\n    *   Since no aldehyde group is formed, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 must be another type.\n    *   Product 3 is the result of cleaving the C=C bond in Product 2. The alcohol functional group (`-CH-OH`) from Product 2 remains intact in Product 3.\n    *   The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, `-CH-OH`) typically resonates at δ = 3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the newly formed ketone will be in the δ = 2.1-2.7 ppm range. Other aliphatic protons will be further upfield.\n    *   Therefore, the **carbinol proton is the most deshielded proton** in Product 3.\n\n4.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of the Carbinol Proton:**\n    *   The question now simplifies to: what is the splitting pattern of the `-CH-OH` proton in Product 3?\n    *   This proton's environment is defined by the rigid carbon skeleton formed during the initial rearrangement from adamantane. Complex coupling patterns like `doublet of triplets` or `triplet of triplets` are common for protons in such rigid bicyclic or tricyclic systems.\n    *   Let's analyze the options based on the neighbors of the carbinol carbon (`*CH-OH`):\n        *   **Triplet of triplets (tot):** Arises if the carbinol proton is coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons. This would imply a `CH₂ — *CH(OH) — CH₂` environment.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets (dot):** Arises if the carbinol proton is coupled to one unique proton and one set of two equivalent protons. This would imply a `CH — *CH(OH) — CH₂` environment.\n    *   The adamantane starting material is built from `CH` (bridgehead) and `CH₂` (bridge) units. Any rearrangement is likely to produce a skeleton with similar units. A ketone is formed at what was originally a `CH₂` position. When reduced to `*CH(OH)`, this carbon is very likely to be adjacent to both bridgehead (`CH`) and bridge (`CH₂`) type carbons.\n    *   The `CH — *CH(OH) — CH₂` motif is a very common structural feature in rearranged cage-like alcohols (e.g., in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane or bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane systems, the C2 alcohol is adjacent to the C1 bridgehead and the C3 methylene bridge).\n    *   In this common `CH — *CH(OH) — CH₂` environment, the carbinol proton is split by the single proton on the `CH` group into a **doublet**. Each line of this doublet is then split by the two protons on the `CH₂` group into a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis detailed analysis, based on interpreting the reaction sequence and the resulting molecular features, strongly supports \"doublet of triplets\" as the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
