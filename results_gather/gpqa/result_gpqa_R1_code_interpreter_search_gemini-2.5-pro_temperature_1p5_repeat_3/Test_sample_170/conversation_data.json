    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of six different substituted benzene compounds. We need to arrange these compounds in order of *increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer*. The weight fraction of an isomer is directly proportional to its mole fraction (percentage yield), as all monobromo-isomers for a given starting material have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to rank the compounds based on the percentage yield of the para-product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring can be classified based on their effect on the reaction rate (activating/deactivating) and the position of substitution (directing effect).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (in Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho-, Para-directing group:** Halogens are an exception. They withdraw electron density via induction (deactivating) but direct to ortho and para positions via resonance.\n    *   3) -Cl (in Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   6) -COOH (in Benzoic acid)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the para-isomer yield for each group.**\n\n*   **Meta-directors (compounds 4, 2, 6):** These substances will yield the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of ortho- and para-isomers will be very low. To rank them, we consider that a stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse of this: C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2).\n    *   Approximate para-yields: Nitrobenzene (~0.1%), Benzoic acid (~1-2%), Ethyl benzoate (~2-3%).\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directors (compounds 1, 5, 3):** These substances will yield significant amounts of both ortho- and para-isomers. The ratio between the ortho and para products is primarily determined by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent on the ring will block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the sterically accessible para position.\n    *   Let's compare the sizes of the substituents: -C2H5 is significantly bulkier than -CH3. The -Cl atom is similar in size to the -CH3 group.\n    *   **Toluene (1, -CH3):** The methyl group offers some steric hindrance. Bromination yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (5, -C2H5):** The bulkier ethyl group provides much more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer, about 94%.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (3, -Cl):** The chloro group's size and strong inductive deactivation at the ortho position favor para substitution. The para-isomer yield is high, about 89%.\n    *   Comparing the percentage yields: 67% (Toluene) < 89% (Chlorobenzene) < 94% (Ethylbenzene).\n    *   So, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the groups and determine the final order.**\nThe meta-directors (4, 6, 2) will have much lower para-yields than the ortho-, para-directors (1, 3, 5). Combining the orders from Step 3 gives the complete sequence:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the derived order with the given options.**\nThe theoretically correct order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 3 < 5.\nLet's check the options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect.\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - This option correctly orders the meta-directors (4<6<2) and correctly identifies toluene (1) as the o,p-director with the lowest para-yield. However, it incorrectly swaps the positions of ethylbenzene (5) and chlorobenzene (3), stating that the para yield of (5) is less than (3) (94% < 89% is false).\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect. It gets the order of meta-directors wrong (2<6) and o,p-directors wrong (3<1).\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect. It gets the order of meta-directors wrong and o,p-directors wrong (5<1).\n\nAmong the given choices, option B has the most correct elements. It correctly groups and orders the meta-directors and correctly places toluene relative to the other o,p-directors. The only error is the inversion of the last two compounds. In the context of a multiple-choice question with a likely error in the options, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
