    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OCH(CH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates the stereocenter is at C5, and its configuration is (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) can occur from either the Re face or the Si face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule already has a stereocenter at C5 (which remains unchanged), the products will be diastereomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** We obtain **2 distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and does not have any stereocenters. It is achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a diketone with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that converts ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   Starting with an achiral molecule and an achiral reagent, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers. They will be produced as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just rotated.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** We obtain **3 distinct stereoisomeric products** (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the total mixture of products**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. The stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **can be separated** and will give distinct peaks.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. They will elute together as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and produce a separate peak (**1 peak**).\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will give a total of 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (one -OH, one ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (two -OH groups) and will have significantly different polarities. Thus, it's safe to assume their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Since we have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our final mixture, and chiral HPLC can resolve them all, we expect to see one peak for each compound.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (It will have a diastereomeric interaction with the CSP relative to the chiral isomers, so it will also be separated).\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
