    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random process. For a single unstable nucleus, it's impossible to predict exactly when it will decay. However, we can determine the probability of it decaying over a certain period. This process is governed by the exponential decay law. A key feature of this law is that it is **\"memoryless\"**. This means the probability of decay per unit time is constant, regardless of how long the nucleus has already existed. The nucleus does not \"age\".\n\n2.  **Define the Decay Law Mathematically:**\n    Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t`. This is also called the survival probability. The formula is:\n    P(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where:\n    *   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a measure of how quickly the atom decays.\n    *   `t` is time.\n\n    The probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is therefore:\n    P_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P_decay(100) = 0.32\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\n    From this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    We don't need to calculate `λ` explicitly. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property to the Question:**\n    The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, *given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes*.\n    Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. The \"clock\" essentially resets.\n\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a brand-new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, which is P_decay(150).\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n    To find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`, we can use the relationship we found in Step 3:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    Using the properties of exponents:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n    e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Now, substitute this back into our probability formula:\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Let's compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# Let this be S_100.\n# S_100 = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n#\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of\n# decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the past 50 minutes.\n# This is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom decays\n# within 150 minutes.\n#\n# P_decay(150) = 1 - S_150 = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n#\n# We can express S_150 in terms of S_100:\n# S_150 = exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5)\n# S_150 = (exp(-lambda * 100))**1.5\n# S_150 = (0.68)**1.5\n#\n# So, the final probability is 1 - (0.68)**1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\n# Convert to percentage\nprobability_percentage = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is {probability_percentage:.1f}%.\")\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the probability is approximately 44.0%.

    "The user wants to find the probability of a radioactive atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. The decay probability in the first 100 minutes is known.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Understand Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The \"clock\" effectively resets at every moment. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Mathematical Model:** The probability of an atom *not* decaying (surviving) up to a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability of the atom decaying within a time `t` is:\n    P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ) from Given Data:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P_decay(100) = 0.32\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\n    This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply P_decay(150).\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n    We can find the value of e^(-λ * 150) using the result from Step 3 and the properties of exponents:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\n    Substitute the value from Step 3:\n    e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n    The Python code executed this calculation:\n    `1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)` gives approximately `0.439`, which is `43.9%`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated probability is 43.9%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
