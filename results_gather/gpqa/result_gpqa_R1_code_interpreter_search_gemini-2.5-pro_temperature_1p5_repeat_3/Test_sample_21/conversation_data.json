    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the thermodynamic aspect of the statement.**\n    The first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ______ oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n    The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher, more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic solution to its potential in acidic solution.\n\n    *   The reduction half-reaction in **acidic** solution is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n    *   The reduction half-reaction in **basic** solution is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\n    Comparing the two values, +0.40 V is significantly lower than +1.23 V. This means that oxygen is a much stronger oxidant in acidic solution than it is in basic solution. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the kinetic aspect of the statement.**\n    The second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts ______ in acidic solutions.\"\n    Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. Even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable (i.e., has a positive E° value), it may proceed very slowly if it has a high activation energy.\n\n    *   The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) to water (H₂O) is a complex process. It requires the breaking of a strong O=O double bond.\n    *   Furthermore, it is a four-electron transfer process. Multi-electron transfer reactions rarely occur in a single step and usually proceed through a series of intermediates. This complex mechanism leads to a high activation energy.\n    *   Because of this high activation energy, the reduction of oxygen is notoriously slow, or \"kinetically sluggish.\" This is a well-known phenomenon in electrochemistry and is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells.\n\n    Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower**. This is true in both acidic and basic solutions, but the question specifically asks about acidic solutions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the findings.**\n    *   From Step 1, the first blank is \"weaker\".\n    *   From Step 2, the second blank is \"slower\".\n\n    The correct combination is **weaker - slower**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
