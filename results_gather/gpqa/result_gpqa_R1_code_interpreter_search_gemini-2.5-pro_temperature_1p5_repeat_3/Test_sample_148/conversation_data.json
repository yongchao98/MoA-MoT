    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:** Let's list the key pieces of experimental evidence provided:\n    *   **Sample:** A chemically synthesized small peptide.\n    *   **Â¹H NMR:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   The two peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal (1:1 ratio), and their sum is correct (1H).\n        *   The peak splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **LC-MS (at elevated temperature):**\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   The intensities (areas) of the two peaks are equal (1:1 ratio).\n        *   Both peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum.\n        *   The mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate from an earlier step in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different molecular weight.\n        *   The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the *expected product*. This observation directly contradicts the possibility of contamination with a precursor. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral (non-chiral) environment.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks, not two. You would only see two sets of peaks if you used a chiral solvent or a chiral shift reagent.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard, achiral LC column, enantiomers are not separated. They would co-elute as a single peak. You would need a chiral stationary phase to separate them.\n        *   Since both the NMR and LC show two distinct signals under what we assume are standard (achiral) conditions, this cannot be a mixture of enantiomers. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, this is a common side reaction where an amino acid's alpha-carbon stereocenter inverts (epimerizes) during the harsh conditions of activation or coupling. For example, if you are making a dipeptide from two L-amino acids (L-AA1 and L-AA2), epimerization of L-AA1 could lead to a mixture of the desired L-L peptide and the undesired D-L peptide. These two peptides (L-L and D-L) are diastereomers.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties because the relative spatial arrangement of their atoms is different. This means their nuclei experience different magnetic environments. Consequently, they will have distinct NMR spectra. A specific proton, like the alpha-proton mentioned, will have a different chemical shift in each diastereomer, leading to two separate peaks, as observed. A 1:1 ratio of integrals suggests the epimerization process was extensive.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers (same atoms, just arranged differently), they have the identical molecular formula and thus the identical molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n        *   This explanation fits all the provided evidence perfectly.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   \"Double coupling\" would imply that an extra molecule has been added to the peptide, for example, a second peptide chain attaching to the first.\n        *   This would create a new product with a significantly different and larger molecular weight.\n        *   The MS data shows that the mass of the compounds in both peaks corresponds to the *expected* molecule, not a larger one. This rules out double coupling. So, D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable species by standard LC that have the same mass but different NMR spectra is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a well-known problem in peptide synthesis caused by epimerization at a chiral alpha-carbon.\n\n<<<C>>>"
