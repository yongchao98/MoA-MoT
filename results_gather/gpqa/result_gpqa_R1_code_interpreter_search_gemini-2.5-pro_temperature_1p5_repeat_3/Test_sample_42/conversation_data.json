    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Molecular Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description into a list of substituents and their relative positions on a benzene ring.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Functional Groups:**\n    1.  Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    2.  Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n    3.  Cyano group (-CN)\n    *   These three groups are **meta** to one another (e.g., at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n*   **Other Substituents (relative to the carboxylic acid):**\n    4.  Hydroxyl group (-OH), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    5.  Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    6.  Methoxy group (-OCH₃), **para** to -COOH.\n*   **Additional Positional Constraints:**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the relevant groups is:\n\n**Carboxylic acid** > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol (Hydroxyl) > Amine > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given information.\n\n1.  Place the **-COOH** group at position **C1**.\n2.  Since the methoxy group is **para** to the -COOH, place the **-OCH₃** group at position **C4**.\n3.  The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are **meta** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n4.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\nOur ring currently looks like this:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C2/C6:** One is -OH, the other is -N(CH₃)₂\n*   **C3/C5:** One is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\nNow, we use the final constraints to determine the exact positions:\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. Its ortho positions are C3 and C5. So the cyano group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the position of -CN:\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for the -OH group.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position for the -OH group.\n\nThese two cases (Case A and Case B) actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective (they are enantiomers, but achiral due to a plane of symmetry if we consider the substituents themselves as points, but they are indeed the same molecule by rotation around the C1-C4 axis). Let's proceed with the structure from Case A, which is sufficient to determine the single correct IUPAC name.\n\nBased on Case A:\n*   If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n    *   The remaining meta position, C5, must be the **-CHO** group.\n    *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must be the **-N(CH₃)₂** group.\n\nThe final, unique structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH\n*   **C3:** -CN\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C5:** -CHO\n*   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂\n\n### 4. Number the Ring and Name the Molecule\n\nThe numbering starts with C1 for the -COOH group. We need to number the rest of the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n*   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince there is a tie, IUPAC rules state that we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent (cyano) gets in each numbering scheme:\n*   With our derived structure (C2=-OH, C3=-CN, etc.), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the positions would be C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH₃, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. In this case, the cyano group would be at C5.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering scheme is the one that assigns C3 to the cyano group. This corresponds to the structure as we derived it.\n\nThe final positions are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\nFinally, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
