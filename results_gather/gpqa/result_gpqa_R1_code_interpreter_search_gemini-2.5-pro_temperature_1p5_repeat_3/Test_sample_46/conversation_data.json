    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n    *   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n    *   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which is 1 DBE).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of absorptions is highly characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aromatic ester (conjugated with a benzene ring). It's too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group) shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester group, -COOEt) deshields its adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verification with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂), which would have a different IR C=O stretch (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex (meta-substitution).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- group would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also have a distinct formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8.2 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C₉H₁₁NO₂ formula, primary amine N-H stretches, conjugated ester C=O stretch, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with one donating and one withdrawing group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
