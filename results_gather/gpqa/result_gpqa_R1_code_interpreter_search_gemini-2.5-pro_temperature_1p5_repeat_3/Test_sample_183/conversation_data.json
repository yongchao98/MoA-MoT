    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt). This is a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu). This is a moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky.\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2). This is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three groups are adjacent on the ring (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a crucial observation. An electrophilic substitution on a ring containing an ethoxy (or hydroxyl) group will not occur at the meta position. This implies that the nitro group was likely present on the ring *before* the ethoxy (or its precursor, hydroxyl) group was introduced in its final form.\n\n### 2. Formulate a General Strategy\n\nBased on the above analysis, a likely strategy is:\n1.  Establish the relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. Since they are *ortho* to each other, this needs to be planned carefully.\n2.  Introduce a precursor to the ethoxy group. The sequence of reactions involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis to OH), and `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) is a standard method to convert a nitro group into an ethoxy group (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`). This suggests that one of the nitro groups in an intermediate will be converted to the final ethoxy group.\n\nSo, the key intermediate we need to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-1,3-dinitrobenzene**, which can then be selectively reduced at one nitro group (the less hindered one, at C1), followed by conversion to the ethoxy group.\n\nLet's see if any option builds this intermediate. A high-yield synthesis of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` is required, which is difficult as nitration of tert-butylbenzene favors the para product. A blocking group strategy is the best approach.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this strategy. The use of a sulfonic acid blocking group is the most effective method to control regiochemistry in this context. Option A is the only one that uses this strategy correctly at the beginning.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Sulfonation. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the sulfonation occurs predominantly at the *para* position. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to -SO3H). This is a high-yield step that correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAt this point, we have `tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, and `SO3H` at C4.\n\nThe sequence of the remaining steps in option A seems unusual, especially step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` after a diazotization. Let's propose a corrected, logical order of the remaining reagents from Option A to complete the synthesis. A plausible, high-yield pathway would proceed as follows from our key intermediate `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`:\n\n*   **Corrected next step: Second Nitration (using reagent vi)**: Let's nitrate our intermediate again. The ring is deactivated, but under forcing conditions, another nitration is possible. The existing groups (`tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, `SO3H` at C4) will direct an incoming electrophile. `tBu` directs to C6 (the other ortho position), `NO2` directs to C6 (meta), and `SO3H` also directs to C6 (meta). All groups direct to position C6. So, we get **`2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Reduction (reagent iv)**: `Fe/HCl` is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the less sterically hindered nitro group preferentially. The nitro group at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2 (which is between tBu and NO2). So, selective reduction gives **`2-nitro-6-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Desulfonation (reagent viii)**: Heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4`) removes the sulfonic acid group. This yields **`3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**. Let's check the structure: NH2 is at C1, tBu at C2, and NO2 at C3. This is precisely the precursor needed for the final steps!\n\n*   **Next: Diazotization (reagent v)**: `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amino group (`-NH2`) into a diazonium salt (`-N2+`).\n\n*   **Next: Hydrolysis (reagent vii)**: `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`**.\n\n*   **Final Step: Etherification (reagent ix)**: `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the desired ethyl ether.\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps provided in Option A successfully produces the target molecule in high yield. The list of reagents is correct, though their numbered order in the option is slightly illogical.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Option B**: Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic and gives mainly the para product, failing to create the 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Option C**: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene directly, which gives a poor yield of the ortho isomer required. The subsequent steps are also nonsensical (e.g., sulfonating/desulfonating the final product).\n*   **Option D**: The order of reactions is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization without an amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the correct set of reagents and the essential blocking group strategy required for this challenging synthesis. While the exact ordering of the later steps as listed is confusing, the reagents themselves allow for a logical, high-yield pathway. The initial steps (i, ii, iii) are perfectly logical and are the only viable way presented to create the necessary *ortho-tert-butyl-nitro* intermediate. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
