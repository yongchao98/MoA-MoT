    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to substitute one of the alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom. Since both alpha-carbons are chemically equivalent, the reaction yields a single product.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the other α-proton (from C6), which is acidic, to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropane ring fused to a cyclohexane ring).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the adjacent carbon (C6) to relieve the strain of the three-membered ring. This ring contraction leads to a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n5.  A final protonation step (assumed during workup) gives the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\nWhile elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, the subsequent reaction steps strongly suggest the Favorskii rearrangement is the intended pathway, as the reagents in steps 3 and 4 are standard for transformations of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂ / Pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃)**\nThis reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the partial reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and will not reduce the acid chloride all the way to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Let's analyze its structure to determine the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals we would expect in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n      CHO (Ha)\n       |\n      C1-Hb\n     /  \\\n  H₂C2 -- C5H₂\n    |    |\n  H₂C3 -- C4H₂\n\nDue to rapid ring flipping at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, C1, and the midpoint of the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain positions equivalent:\n*   C2 is equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\nNow, let's count the distinct types of protons:\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (Ha):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Methine proton on C1 (Hb):** This proton is attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group. It is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These carbons are equivalent. Each is a CH₂ group. The two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic** (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule). This means they are chemically distinct from each other. The same is true for the protons on C5. Because of the overall symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to their respective counterparts on C5. This gives us **two distinct sets** of protons from the C2/C5 positions (each set contains 2 protons, for a total of 4). (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The same is true for C4. This gives us another **two distinct sets** of protons from the C3/C4 positions. These are different from the C2/C5 protons because they are further from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. (2 types)\n\nTotaling the distinct types of hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde."
