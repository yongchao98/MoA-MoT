    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Given Information**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Structure of Candidates**\nThe molecular formula C10H14 has a degree of unsaturation of 4 (calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4`), which corresponds to a substituted benzene ring.\nThe substituents must account for C4H8.\n*   **Tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4):** The four methyl groups (4 x CH3) are C4H12. This doesn't match C4H8. Let's recalculate. The benzene core is C6. The substituents are C4H14. This is consistent with four methyl groups (C4H12) on a C6H2 ring (total C10H14) or two ethyl groups (C4H10) on a C6H4 ring (total C10H14).\n\nLet's examine the 1H NMR spectrum predicted for each option based on its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1-Me and C3-Me are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   C5-Me is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not a singlet. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The ethyl group protons (CH2 and CH3) are not singlets. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons into a quartet, and the CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons into a triplet. The problem explicitly states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound is therefore not in the mixture.\n\n### **3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\n*   The aromatic region shows two separate singlets. This means the mixture must contain two different compounds, and *each* must produce a single singlet in its aromatic spectrum.\n*   Based on our analysis in step 2, only **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** fit this criterion. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would give doublets, and 1,4-diethylbenzene has been ruled out by the aliphatic signals.\n*   Therefore, the two compounds must be **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n### **4. Verify the Aliphatic Spectrum of the Mixture**\n\nLet's confirm that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds produces the observed aliphatic spectrum.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes one singlet of 12H intensity.\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** Contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n\nThe problem states the final spectrum of the mixture shows **three signals** with a ratio of **2:1:1**. This implies that some of the signals from the individual compounds overlap (are accidentally degenerate) in the mixture's spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals from the 1:1 mixture:\n1.  A singlet from Compound 1 (relative intensity 12H).\n2.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 6H).\n3.  A singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n4.  Another singlet from Compound 2 (relative intensity 3H).\n\nTo get only three signals, two of these must overlap. The most plausible scenario that fits the 2:1:1 ratio is if the two 3H signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** are accidentally degenerate (i.e., they have the same chemical shift).\n\nIf this overlap occurs, the signals in the mixture's spectrum would be:\n*   **Signal 1:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 2:** 6H (from C1/C3-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n*   **Signal 3:** 3H + 3H = 6H (from the overlapped C2- and C5-methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)\n\nThe integration ratio of these three signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\nThis perfectly matches the experimental data provided in the problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe two compounds in the 1:1 mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
