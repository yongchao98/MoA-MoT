    "*   **Analyze Option (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.** This is essentially a planet identical to Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **Analyze Option (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.** The density is explicitly stated to be about 5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth's density. Even though it's more massive, its density is given. This implies its radius must be larger than Earth's in a way that keeps the density the same. (Specifically, since Density = Mass/Volume, if Mass is 2x and Density is 1x, then Volume must be 2x, meaning the radius is 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26 times Earth's radius).\n\n*   **Analyze Option (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.** \"Same composition\" means it's made of the same stuff (e.g., iron, silicates) in the same proportions as Earth. For terrestrial (rocky) planets, as the mass increases, the force of its own gravity increases significantly. This powerful gravity compresses the planet's material, packing the atoms closer together. This effect, known as gravitational compression, means that a more massive planet with the same composition will have a higher average density than a less massive one. A 5 Earth-mass planet will be substantially compressed by its own gravity, making it much denser than Earth.\n\n*   **Analyze Option (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.** Following the same logic as in (c), a planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity. With less gravitational compression, the material will be less tightly packed. Therefore, a planet with the same composition as Earth but only half the mass will be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density(c) > Density(a) (due to gravitational compression from higher mass)\n*   Density(d) < Density(a) (due to less gravitational compression from lower mass)\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
