    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the element, M(Y) is its molar mass, n is the number of fluorine atoms, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~18.998 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (M(Y) + n * 18.998)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 18.998 = n * 18.998\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 18.998 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.926 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.44 * n\n\n    Now we test integer values for n, which represents the oxidation state of Y.\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.44 g/mol (Close to Ca, but Ca doesn't fit the other properties).\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.88 g/mol (Close to Br, but bromine fluorides don't match).\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.32 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.76 g/mol (No suitable element).\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.2 g/mol (Close to Tl, Hg, but their chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.6 g/mol (Close to Pu, Am). If Y=Pu, A2 would be PuF6. However, PuF6 decomposes to PuF4, not formed from another fluoride's decomposition. If A2=PuF4, its ɷF is ~24%, which doesn't match.\n\n    Let's confirm with Y = Antimony (Sb) and n = 3. A2 would be SbF3.\n    M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 = 0.3188, or 31.88%.\n    This is extremely close to the given 31.96%, making Y=Sb and A2=SbF3 the most credible identification.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine. The reaction is A1 → SbF3 + F2. To balance this, A1 must be a higher fluoride of antimony. The most common higher fluoride is SbF5. So, A1 = SbF5.\n    *   The problem describes A1 as a \"bright-red substance\". SbF5 is colorless/white. This is a contradiction, likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement's qualitative description. We'll trust the numerical data over the color.\n    *   A1 (SbF5) is a very strong oxidizer and Lewis acid, known to react with and oxidize xenon, which fits the description.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. Direct fluorination of antimony yields SbF3 or SbF5. Since it interacts with xenon, it must be the strong oxidizer SbF5. So, A3 = SbF5.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A5.**\n    *   A5 is obtained from Y (Sb) and A4. It decomposes in water to form \"two substances\".\n    *   The hydrolysis of antimony trifluoride (SbF3) is known to produce antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrogen fluoride (HF).\n        SbF3 + H2O → SbOF + 2HF\n    *   This reaction yields exactly two substances. This strongly suggests that A5 = SbF3. Note that A5 is the same compound as A2.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A4 and its Molecular Weight.**\n    *   A5 (SbF3) is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction is: Sb + A4 → SbF3.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction, where Sb(0) is oxidized and a higher oxidation state of Sb in A4 is reduced. To produce Sb(III)F3, A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state, which means A4 must be SbF5.\n    *   The known reaction is: 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3. The stoichiometry is 2:3, not 1:1 as stated in the problem. This is another likely inaccuracy in the problem statement. However, the reactants (Sb, SbF5) and product (SbF3) are chemically correct.\n    *   Accepting that A4 is SbF5 based on the chemical transformation, we can calculate its molecular weight.\n        M(A4) = M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given ranges.**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) is 216.75 g/mol.\n    *   The given ranges are:\n        A) 160-180\n        B) 110-130\n        C) 220-240\n        D) 140-160\n    *   Our calculated value of 216.75 g/mol does not strictly fall into any of these ranges.\n    *   However, it is very close to range C (220-240). The difference is only 3.25 g/mol from the lower bound. This type of small discrepancy in the ranges is common in complex chemistry problems.\n    *   Let's consider the alternative: if A4 were SbF3, its molecular weight would be ~178.8 g/mol, which falls perfectly in range A. However, the chemical reaction Sb + SbF3 → SbF3 makes no chemical sense.\n    *   Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is SbF5 and the provided range C has a minor typo.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF5) is ~217 g/mol, which is closest to the range 220-240 g/mol.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the reasoning, we identify element Y as Antimony (Sb) and compound A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n# Let's calculate the molecular weight of SbF5.\n# Molar mass of Sb = 121.76 g/mol\n# Molar mass of F = 18.998 g/mol\n\nM_Sb = 121.76\nM_F = 18.998\n\n# Molecular weight of A4 = SbF5\nM_A4 = M_Sb + 5 * M_F\n\nprint(f\"{M_A4=}\")\n\n# The given ranges are:\n# A) 160-180\n# B) 110-130\n# C) 220-240\n# D) 140-160\n\n# The calculated value is 216.75 g/mol.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n    We are given that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, M(Y) is its molar mass, and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × n × 19.00 = n × 19.00\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × 0.6804\n    M(Y) ≈ n × (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    We now test integer values for n, which corresponds to the oxidation state of element Y.\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't align).\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No suitable element).\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Hg or Tl, but less likely based on subsequent clues).\n\n    Let's verify our choice. If Y = Sb and n = 3, then A2 is SbF₃.\n    Let's calculate the precise mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ (using M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol and M(F) = 18.998 g/mol):\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol\n    ɷF = (3 × 18.998) / 178.754 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n    This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that **Y is Sb** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3**\n    *   A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 must be a fluoride of antimony with a higher oxidation state. The most stable and common higher fluoride is Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅. So, **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The problem states A1 oxidizes xenon. SbF₅ is an extremely powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, known to react with xenon. This further supports A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   A3 is obtained by direct fluorination of element Y (Sb) and it also reacts with xenon. Fluorination of antimony can yield SbF₃ or SbF₅. Since A3 reacts with xenon, it must be the strong oxidizer, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5**\n    *   A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. Let's consider the hydrolysis of SbF₃ (our compound A2).\n        SbF₃ + H₂O → SbOF↓ + 2HF(aq)\n        This reaction produces two distinct substances: antimony oxyfluoride (SbOF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). This perfectly matches the description. Thus, it is highly likely that **A5 = SbF₃**.\n    *   Now, let's look at the formation of A5. It is obtained by adding element Y (Sb) to a solution of A4.\n        Reaction: Sb + A4 → A5 (which is SbF₃)\n        The reaction is: Sb⁰ + A4 → Sb⁺³F₃.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction. Antimony in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) is oxidized to +3. For this to happen, A4 must contain antimony in a higher oxidation state that gets reduced to +3. The only common higher fluoride is SbF₅. Therefore, **A4 = SbF₅**.\n    *   The chemical reaction is: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. While the problem states a 1:1 molar ratio, this is likely an error in the problem statement, as is common in complex descriptive problems. The chemical transformation itself is the crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n    We have confidently identified A4 as Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). Now we calculate its molecular weight.\n    M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n    M(F) = 18.998 g/mol\n    Molecular Weight of A4 (SbF₅) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 18.998 = 121.76 + 94.99 = **216.75 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range**\n    We need to find the range in which the molecular weight of 216.75 g/mol falls.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 110-130\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The calculated value of 216.75 g/mol does not fit exactly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to range C. The difference between our calculated value and the lower bound of range C is only 220 - 216.75 = 3.25. This small discrepancy suggests that C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
