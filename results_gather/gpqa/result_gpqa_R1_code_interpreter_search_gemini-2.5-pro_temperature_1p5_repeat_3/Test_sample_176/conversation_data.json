    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Law of Luminosity:** For a star that radiates as a perfect black body, its luminosity ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4$\n    where $A$ is the surface area of the star ($A = 4\\pi R^2$ for a sphere), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature of the star.\n    Substituting the area, we get:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star and then find their ratio:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** To find the ratio of the temperatures ($T_1/T_2$), we need to use the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature ($T$) to the peak wavelength at which it emits most of its radiation ($\\lambda_{em,max}$):\n        $\\lambda_{em,max} = \\frac{b}{T}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n        This means the temperature ratio is inversely related to the ratio of their *emitted* peak wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,max,2}}{\\lambda_{em,max,1}}$\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The astronomers measured the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs,max}$) to be the same. The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to the observer. For non-relativistic speeds ($v_r \\ll c$), the relationship is:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{em} (1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$\n        (A positive $v_r$ indicates the star is moving away, causing a redshift).\n\n    *   **Applying the Doppler Effect:**\n        -   For Star_1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,max,1} = \\lambda_{em,max,1}$.\n        -   For Star_2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Assuming this positive velocity means it's moving away, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,max,2} = \\lambda_{em,max,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$.\n\n    *   **Connecting the Pieces:** We are given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same:\n        $\\lambda_{obs,max,1} = \\lambda_{obs,max,2}$\n        Substituting the expressions from above:\n        $\\lambda_{em,max,1} = \\lambda_{em,max,2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\n        Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{em,max,2}}{\\lambda_{em,max,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\n        Since $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em,max,2}}{\\lambda_{em,max,1}}$, we have:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)^4}$\n\n    We use the following values:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n    Let's compute the final value.\n\n```python\n# Define the given parameters\nradius_ratio = 1.5\nvelocity_star2 = 700 * 1000  # in m/s\nspeed_of_light = 299792458  # in m/s\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio based on the derived formula\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4\nv_over_c = velocity_star2 / speed_of_light\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) / ((1 + v_over_c)**4)\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.2291\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.2291. This value is closest to option D. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies to treat them as black body radiators.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The step-by-step derivation of the formula is as follows:\n\n1.  **Luminosity:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio $L_1/L_2$:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** We are given that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so:\n    $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    Substituting this in, we get:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em, max}$) is inversely proportional to the temperature: $\\lambda_{em, max} \\propto 1/T$. Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em, max, 2}}{\\lambda_{em, max, 1}}$\n    *   The *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs, max}$) are affected by the Doppler shift due to the stars' radial velocities ($v_r$). The relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{em, max, 1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs, max, 2} = \\lambda_{em, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   We are told the observed wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs, max, 1} = \\lambda_{obs, max, 2}$.\n    *   Therefore: $\\lambda_{em, max, 1} = \\lambda_{em, max, 2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging gives the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_{em, max, 2}}{\\lambda_{em, max, 1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n    *   Since $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{em, max, 2}}{\\lambda_{em, max, 1}}$, we have:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_{r2}/c)^4}$\n\n    Using the Python code to perform the calculation:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n    The code calculated the ratio to be `2.2291`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23. The extraneous information about mass is not used as the problem assumes the stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
