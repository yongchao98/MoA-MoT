    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy's frame:** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n    *   **Ejecta's frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference, traveling at a high velocity relative to the Galaxy's frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is Δt₀ = 50 s. This is called the proper time because the \"clock\" (in this case, the duration of the event) is at rest in this frame.\n    *   **Speed of light (c):** The speed of light is approximately c = 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To do this, we need two things: the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame (which is given as v = 60,000 km/s) and the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   According to special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    *   Where:\n        *   Δt is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame).\n        *   Δt₀ is the proper time measured in the moving frame (ejecta's frame).\n        *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio v/c:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\n        Δt = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time, both measured in the same frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n        d = v * Δt\n        d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )\n        d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km\n        d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get the numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # Velocity in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # Proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the time (dt) that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula.\n# First, calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta_sq = (v / c)**2\n\n# Second, calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Third, calculate the dilated time (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n# Distance = velocity * time (all measured in the same frame)\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "This problem requires using the concept of time dilation from Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   The **Galaxy's frame of reference**, which we can consider the \"stationary\" frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The **ejecta's frame of reference**, which is the \"moving\" frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is known as the **proper time** because it's measured by a clock at rest in that frame.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance the ejecta travels *as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame* (frame S).\n    *   The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   Both the velocity and time in this formula must be measured in the same reference frame, which is the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   So, we need `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:** According to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). The time interval `Δt` in the stationary frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate v²/c².**\n        (v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ.**\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the time interval Δt in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n        Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n        This shows that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n    *   **Step 5: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.**\n        d = v * Δt\n        d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )\n        d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km\n        d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km\n\n6.  **Code-assisted Computation:** To get a precise numerical value, we can perform the calculation with Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # Velocity in km/s\ndt0 = 50   # Proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta squared (v^2/c^2)\nbeta_sq = (v / c)**2\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the time that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame (dilated time)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames and Given Information:**\n    *   We have a \"stationary\" frame of reference, which is the Galaxy.\n    *   We have a \"moving\" frame of reference, which is the supernova ejecta.\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame (the ejecta's own clock) is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Distance is calculated as `distance = velocity × time`. All quantities must be measured in the same frame of reference (the Galaxy's frame).\n    *   So, we need `d = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   Due to relativistic effects, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving ejecta frame. This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dilated Time (`Δt`):**\n    *   First, calculate the term `v²/c²`:\n        `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, plug this into the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = 50 s / √(1 - 0.04) = 50 s / √0.96`\n    *   `Δt ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.03 s`. So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, about 51 seconds pass in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:**\n    *   Now use the calculated time `Δt` to find the distance `d`.\n        `d = v × Δt`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s × (50 / √0.96) s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The code output `3061862` provides the precise result for the calculation `3,000,000 / √0.96`.\n    *   `d = 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to option **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
