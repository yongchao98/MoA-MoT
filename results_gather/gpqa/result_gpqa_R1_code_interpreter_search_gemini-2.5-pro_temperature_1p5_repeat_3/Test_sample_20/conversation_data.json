    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A):**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, known as tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl C=O group).\n    *   Let's examine **benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone). The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4). The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Now, let's examine **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**. This molecule is a cyclic ketone with carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form, which is **phloroglucinol** (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore exceptionally stable, meaning the equilibrium lies far towards the enol side. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows extensive tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B):**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs when a molecule is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism (exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   Now, let's examine **dimethyl fumarate**. This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). Molecules with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus do not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
