    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n    *   The aromatic nature implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. An ester has the structure R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for one more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities. For example, we cannot have ethyl, propyl, or butyl groups in their standard forms.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para). This confirms the C6H4 part. Total protons so far: 4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. Let's analyze the coupling:\n        *   Structure: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)`, so its signal is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` (causing a doublet split) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (causing a quartet split). The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group adds 1 degree of unsaturation (the C=C double bond). Total protons from this group: 1+1+3 = 5.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct methyl group signals.\n        *   One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the identified parts to build the whole molecule.\n    *   **Fragment 1:** The di-substituted aromatic ring: **C6H4**.\n    *   **Fragment 2:** The propenyl group: **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Fragment 3:** The ester group part containing the second methyl group.\n        *   If it's a methyl ester group attached to the ring: -COOCH3. The formula for this fragment is **-C2H3O2**.\n        *   If it's an acetate group attached to the ring: -O-CO-CH3. The formula for this fragment is also **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester group fragment have the same formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Formula:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check if our proposed structure has 6 DoU: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (propenyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 6. The DoU matches.\n    *   The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C. Other options like C12H14O2 or C11H14O2 would imply the presence of CH2 groups or a different degree of unsaturation, which contradicts the given data. C12H12O2 was shown in the thought process to be inconsistent with the number of vinyl signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
