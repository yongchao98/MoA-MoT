Understand the Physics Principle: Time Dilation**\n\nThe core of this problem is the concept of time dilation from Einstein's special theory of relativity. It states that for an observer in a moving reference frame (the astronaut), time passes slower than for an observer in a stationary reference frame (on Earth). The relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n*   `Δt = γ * Δτ`\n    *   `Δt` is the time measured by the stationary observer (on Earth).\n    *   `Δτ` is the \"proper time\" measured by the moving observer (the astronaut).\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**2. Identify Given and Required Information**\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Speed of the spacecraft (`v`) = 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n    *   Astronaut's age = 22 years\n    *   Astronaut's species lifespan = 150 years\n*   **Required Information (to be found):**\n    *   The distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A quick search reveals this distance is approximately **163,000 light-years**.\n*   **To Calculate:**\n    *   The time elapsed for the astronaut during the journey (`Δτ`).\n\n**3. Calculate the Time in the Earth's Reference Frame (`Δt`)**\n\nThis is the time it would take to cover the distance as measured from Earth.\n*   Distance (`d`) = 163,000 light-years\n*   Speed (`v`) = 0.99999987 * c\n*   Time (`Δt`) = Distance / Speed = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, the time is:\n`Δt` ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ **163,000.021 years**\n\nSo, from Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor determines the magnitude of time dilation.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √(2.599... x 10⁻⁷)\n*   γ ≈ **2041.24**\n\n**5. Calculate the Time for the Astronaut (`Δτ`)**\n\nNow, we can find the time that passes for the astronaut.\n*   `Δτ = Δt / γ`\n*   `Δτ` ≈ 163,000.021 years / 2041.24\n*   `Δτ` ≈ **79.85 years**\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nFrom the astronaut's point of view, the journey to Earth will take approximately 79.85 years.\n\nFirst, let's check if the astronaut survives.\n*   Age at arrival = Initial Age + Travel Time = 22 + 79.85 = 101.85 years.\n*   Since 101.85 years is less than the 150-year lifespan, the astronaut will survive. This rules out option A.\n\nNow, let's compare our calculated time with the given options:\n*   A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth. (Incorrect)\n*   B) 81 years\n*   C) 77 years\n*   D) 72 years\n\nOur calculated value of **79.85 years** is very close to 80 years. Among the choices provided, **81 years** is the nearest value. The small difference is likely due to the problem using a slightly different approximation for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (e.g., using a distance of ~165,000 light-years would yield a result of ~81 years).\n\nTherefore, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
