    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a particle decay. The fundamental principles governing this process are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince this is a relativistic process, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum ($P_{initial}$): $P_{\\pi^+} = 0$.\n    *   Initial energy ($E_{initial}$): Since the pion is at rest, its kinetic energy is zero. Its total energy is its rest mass energy, $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Let their momenta be $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$, and their total energies be $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   We assume the neutrino is massless, which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   $P_{initial} = P_{final}$\n    *   $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    *   This implies $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n    *   The magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n    *   $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   We need to express the final energies in terms of the momentum 'p'.\n    *   For the muon (massive): $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino (massless): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n\n**4. Solve for Momentum**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions back into the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nTo solve for 'pc', rearrange the equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nIsolate 'pc':\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi^+}c^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nLet's use the given values to calculate 'pc' and then the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) = 105.7 MeV\n\nI will now use Python to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# 1. Calculate the momentum (pc) of the product particles in MeV\npc_numerator = m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2\npc_denominator = 2 * m_pi_c2\npc = pc_numerator / pc_denominator\n\n# 2. Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# For a massless particle, total energy is its kinetic energy and E_nu = pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# 3. Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\n# E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu_c2)^2)\nE_mu = math.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2)\n# Alternatively, from energy conservation: E_mu = m_pi_c2 - E_nu\n# E_mu = m_pi_c2 - pc\n\n# 4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles.\n\n1.  **Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay equals the total momentum after.\n\n2.  **Initial State (Before Decay):**\n    *   The Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is 0.\n    *   Its initial total energy ($E_{initial}$) is its rest mass energy, $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Final State (After Decay):**\n    *   The product particles are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        $ \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p $\n    *   The total energy in the final state is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        $ E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu} $\n\n4.  **Relativistic Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $KE = E - mc^2$.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino (nu), we assume it is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its total energy is entirely kinetic: $E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n5.  **Solving for Momentum:**\n    Applying conservation of energy:\n    $ E_{initial} = E_{final} $\n    $ m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu} $\n    $ m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc $\n\n    To solve for `pc`, we rearrange and square the equation:\n    $ m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} $\n    $ (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 $\n    $ (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 $\n    $ (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 $\n    $ 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 $\n    $ pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi^+}c^2} $\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the provided values: $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$ and $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:**\n        $ KE_{\\nu} = pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} $\n        $ KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} $\n        $ KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV} $\n\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon:**\n        First, we find the total energy of the muon using conservation of energy:\n        $ E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu} $\n        $ E_{\\mu^+} = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 \\text{ MeV} $\n        Now, we find the kinetic energy of the muon:\n        $ KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 $\n        $ KE_{\\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \\text{ MeV} $\n        (Using more precise values from the code output, we get 4.12 MeV).\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.
