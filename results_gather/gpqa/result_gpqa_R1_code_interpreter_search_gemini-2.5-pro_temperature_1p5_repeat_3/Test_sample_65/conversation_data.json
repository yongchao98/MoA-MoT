    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed to parameterize the effects of new physics at energy scales beyond what current experiments can directly probe. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian follows specific principles. Let's analyze the symmetries in question:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in all known laws of physics. Any local Quantum Field Theory (QFT), including the SMEFT, is built on the principle of Lorentz invariance. All operators in the SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry:** This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that is assumed to hold for any QFT describing particle physics. All operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry (Charge-Parity):** This symmetry is already known to be violated in the Standard Model itself, specifically in the weak interactions (e.g., the CKM matrix in the quark sector). The purpose of the SMEFT is to parameterize all possible new physics effects, including new sources of CP violation. Therefore, there are many allowed SMEFT operators that explicitly violate CP symmetry. It is not a required symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal):** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of C, P, and T. Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT would require a much more drastic modification of the fundamental principles of QFT than what the SMEFT entails.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n*   1. Lorentz Symmetry - Yes\n*   2. Poincare symmetry - Yes\n*   3. CP symmetry - No\n*   4. CPT symmetry - Yes\n\nThis corresponds to the combination 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
