    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to show the proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_i and Planet_j) is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_j}{a_i}}$\n\nSo, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, the ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law.**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets is:\n$\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left(\\frac{P_j}{P_i}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nFor Planet_2 and Planet_4, this becomes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships.**\n\nSubstitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**4. Use the given orbital period ratios and calculate.**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods:\n$P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$\n\nFrom this, we can determine the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nNow, plug this value into the final equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nI will use a simple Python script to calculate this value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio, which is the cube root of the period ratio\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of an exoplanet orbiting a star is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\nFrom this, we find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4}$:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
