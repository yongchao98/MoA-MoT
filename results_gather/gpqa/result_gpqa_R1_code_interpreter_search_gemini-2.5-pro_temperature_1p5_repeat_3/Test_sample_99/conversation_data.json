    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\nCompound A has the molecular formula C3H6. This formula corresponds to either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane (a cycloalkane). The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4), which is a characteristic test for unsaturation. Alkenes undergo addition reactions with Br2/CCl4, while cycloalkanes (except for very strained rings under specific conditions, which is not the case here) do not react. Therefore, Compound A must be propene.\n*   **A = Propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\nCompound A (propene) undergoes bromination. This is an electrophilic addition reaction where a molecule of bromine (Br2) adds across the double bond.\nCH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   **B = 1,2-Dibromopropane**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\nCompound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). Alcoholic KOH is a strong base that promotes elimination reactions (dehydrohalogenation). Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (a vicinal dihalide), two molecules of HBr will be eliminated to form an alkyne.\nCH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) --(heat)--> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   **C = Propyne**\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\nCompound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic reaction for the cyclic polymerization of alkynes. Three molecules of the alkyne polymerize to form a substituted benzene ring. In the case of propyne, three molecules join to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, which is also known as mesitylene.\n3 CH3-C≡CH --(Red hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n*   **D = Mesitylene**\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound E**\nCompound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This mixture is characteristically the nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid, HNO3, and concentrated sulfuric acid, H2SO4), used for the nitration of aromatic rings. Mesitylene is an activated ring, and the electrophilic substitution (nitration) occurs at a position activated by the methyl groups. The product is 2-nitromesitylene.\nMesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O\n*   **E = 2-Nitromesitylene**\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound F**\nCompound E (2-nitromesitylene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n2-Nitromesitylene + Fe/HCl --> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + H2O\nThe product is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, also known as mesidine.\n*   **F = Mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline)**\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound G**\nCompound F (mesidine, an aromatic primary amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at 0-5°C). This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group into a diazonium salt group (-N2+).\nMesidine + HNO2 --(HCl, 0-5°C)--> Mesitylenediazonium salt\n*   **G = Mesitylenediazonium salt**\n\n**Step 8: Identify Compound H**\nCompound G (mesitylenediazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When a diazonium salt is warmed in an aqueous solution (which can be neutral, acidic, or basic), the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\nMesitylenediazonium salt + H2O/OH- --(heat)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol + N2\nThe product is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, also known as mesitol.\n*   **H = Mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol)**\n\n**Step 9: Evaluate the given statements**\n\nNow, let's check each statement:\n\n*   **A) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   H is mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol). The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of a colored complex. However, phenols with bulky groups at the ortho positions (like the two methyl groups in mesitol) are sterically hindered and often give a negative test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs. Since the ferric chloride solution itself is yellow-brown, a negative result means the solution remains yellow. The statement \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading; it implies the formation of a yellow product, which is incorrect. Phenols either give a violet/blue/green color or no reaction. Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect in its implication.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline). Aromatic amines are crucial starting materials in the synthesis of azo dyes, a large and commercially important class of dyes. This is a well-known application. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. Like other small hydrocarbons, it is highly flammable. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are only two types of protons. The nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups give one signal. The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent and give a second signal. Since there are no adjacent protons to either set, both signals appear as singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStatements B, C, and D are factually correct based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry. Statement A is incorrect because mesitol (H) does not \"give a yellow color\" in the sense of a positive chemical test. Due to steric hindrance, it gives a negative ferric chloride test (the solution remains yellow, the color of the reagent) or at best a transient green color, but it does not form a new stable yellow complex.\n\n<<<A>>>"
