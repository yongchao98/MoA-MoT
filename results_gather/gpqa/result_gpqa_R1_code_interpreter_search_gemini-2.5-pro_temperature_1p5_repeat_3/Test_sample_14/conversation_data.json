    "The user wants to find which of two planets has a higher transit probability and by what factor.\n\n**1. Understand Transit Probability**\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula:\n*   P_transit ≈ R_star / a\nwhere R_star is the radius of the star and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. This formula assumes the orbit is circular and has a random inclination with respect to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Define Variables for the Two Systems**\nLet's denote the properties for Planet_1 and its host star with a subscript '1', and for Planet_2 with a subscript '2'.\n*   Transit probability of Planet_1: Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1\n*   Transit probability of Planet_2: Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2\n*   Radius of Star 1: R_s1\n*   Radius of Star 2: R_s2\n*   Semi-major axis of Planet_1: a_1\n*   Semi-major axis of Planet_2: a_2\n*   Orbital period of Planet_1: P_1\n*   Orbital period of Planet_2: P_2\n*   Mass of Star 1: M_s1\n*   Mass of Star 2: M_s2\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Establish Relationships**\nFrom the problem description, we have the following relationships:\n*   \"both host stars have the same radii\": R_s1 = R_s2\n*   \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\": P_1 = P_2 / 3, which means P_2 / P_1 = 3\n*   \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\": M_s1 = 2 * M_s2, which means M_s1 / M_s2 = 2\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of Transit Probabilities**\nThe researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability. We need to calculate the ratio Prob_1 / Prob_2.\n*   Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)\n*   Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)\n\nSince R_s1 = R_s2, the first term (R_s1 / R_s2) becomes 1. The ratio simplifies to:\n*   Ratio = a_2 / a_1\n\nTo find the ratio of probabilities, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.\n\n**5. Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\nKepler's Third Law states:\n*   P² = (4π² / G*M_star) * a³\nWhere P is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and M_star is the mass of the star.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for 'a':\n*   a³ = (G * M_star / 4π²) * P²\n*   a = [ (G * M_star / 4π²) * P² ]^(1/3)\n*   a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can write the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n*   a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)\n*   a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 / M_s1) * (P_2 / P_1)² ]^(1/3)\n\n**6. Substitute the Known Ratios**\nWe already established that M_s1 / M_s2 = 2 (so M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2) and P_2 / P_1 = 3.\n*   a_2 / a_1 = [ (1/2) * (3)² ]^(1/3)\n*   a_2 / a_1 = [ (1/2) * 9 ]^(1/3)\n*   a_2 / a_1 = (9/2)^(1/3)\n*   a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n**7. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nThe ratio of the probabilities (Prob_1 / Prob_2) is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1).\nThe python code execution has already calculated this value for us.\n*   Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis means Prob_1 ≈ 1.65 * Prob_2.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
