    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. This structure contributes an IHD of 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2.\n2.  **Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO)** at position 2. This group is an aldehyde and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at position 5. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n3.  **Total IHD of the Starting Material:**\n    *   IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in COOH) + (from C=O in CHO) + (from C=C in vinyl)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A detailed count gives H=12. (C1-H, C2-H, C3-H, C4-H, C5-H, C6-2H, COOH-H, CHO-H, Vinyl-3H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens).\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the starting material is as follows:\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C double bonds) to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n\nIn this reaction, all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be saturated with hydrogen, and all oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group `(-CH2-CH3)`.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact isomerism doesn't affect the molecular formula). The product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n1.  **Carbon Atoms (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change during the reduction. The product still has **10 carbons**.\n2.  **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n3.  **Oxygen Atoms (O):** All oxygens are removed.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nFor a hydrocarbon (containing only C and H), this simplifies to:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\n\nPlugging in the values for the product (C=10, H=20):\n\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure. The product is a saturated alkane framework containing a single ring. Each ring in a molecule contributes 1 to the IHD. Since the product has only one ring and no double or triple bonds, its IHD is 1.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) 0\nB) 3\nC) 1\nD) 5\n\nOur calculated IHD is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
