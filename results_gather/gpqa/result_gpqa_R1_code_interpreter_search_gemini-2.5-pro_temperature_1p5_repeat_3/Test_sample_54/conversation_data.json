    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Indicates a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet)**: This methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm)**: This is a characteristic chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, specifically an acetyl group (-C(O)CH₃). This suggests the presence of an acetate functional group in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm**:\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.0 - 7.5 ppm)**: These signals are in the vinylic region, indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H).\n    *   The molecule must contain a double bond.\n\n3.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Indicates another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet)**: This methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm)**: This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:\n    *   **Integration (1H)**: A single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets)**: This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) means it is coupled to one other proton. The \"q\" (quartet) means it is coupled to an adjacent methyl group (3 protons). This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH₃ moiety. This proton is the one in the middle, `C-CH-CH₃`.\n\n5.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**:\n    *   **Integration (1H)**: The second single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet)**: This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz)**: This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis or trans). The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is typically:\n        *   **~12-18 Hz for a *trans* configuration.**\n        *   **~6-12 Hz for a *cis* configuration.**\n    *   Since the observed J value is 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   An acetyl group (-O-C(O)CH₃), from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm.\n\nCombining these fragments gives **propenyl acetate**. The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(O)-CH₃.\n\nThe total proton count from the data is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H. Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 8 protons, which is consistent. Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 protons, so C and D can be eliminated based on proton count alone.\n\nThe J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz for the vinylic protons confirms the double bond has a *trans* configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's assign all the peaks to the Trans-propenyl acetate structure:\n*   **d) Acetyl CH₃**: Signal at 2.1 ppm (singlet).\n*   **a) Allylic CH₃**: Signal at 1.6 ppm (doublet, coupled to proton b).\n*   **b) Vinylic H**: Signal at 5.5 ppm (doublet of quartets, coupled to proton c and allylic methyl group a).\n*   **c) Vinylic H**: Signal at 7.0 ppm (doublet, coupled to proton b, J=16.0 Hz confirms trans). The high chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
