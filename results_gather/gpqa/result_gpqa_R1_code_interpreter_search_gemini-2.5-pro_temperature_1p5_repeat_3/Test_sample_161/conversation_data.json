    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Metric and Area Element**\n\n    The problem provides a metric, which describes the infinitesimal distance $ds$ between two points on a surface:\n    $ds^{2}=g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$\n\n    In our case, the metric is:\n    $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\n    This is a diagonal metric, where:\n    $g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n    $g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n    $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\n    The area element $dA$ on a surface with metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is given by:\n    $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$\n    where $\\det(g)$ is the determinant of the metric tensor matrix $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Area Element**\n\n    First, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\n    Next, we take the square root to find the magnitude of the area element:\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right|$\n\n    The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" implies that the relevant domain is the disk where $x^2+y^2 < 4$. In this domain, the denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ is positive, so we can drop the absolute value bars.\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n\n    So, the area element is:\n    $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n3.  **Set Up the Area Integral**\n\n    The total area $A$ is found by integrating the area element $dA$ over the entire surface. The domain of this surface is the open disk of radius 2, i.e., $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n    $A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n4.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates**\n\n    To evaluate this integral, it is much easier to switch to polar coordinates.\n    Let:\n    $x = r \\cos\\theta$\n    $y = r \\sin\\theta$\n    This means $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\n    The differential area element in the coordinate system changes as $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n\n    The domain of integration in polar coordinates is $0 \\le r < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\n\n    Substituting these into the integral, we get:\n    $A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\cdot (r \\, dr \\, d\\theta)$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**\n\n    We can separate the integral into parts for $\\theta$ and $r$:\n    $A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr\\right)$\n\n    The integral with respect to $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n    $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$\n\n    The integral with respect to $r$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ becomes infinite at the boundary $r=2$. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n    $\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\n    To find the integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-r^2$. This gives $du = -2r \\, dr$, or $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\n    $\\int \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\int \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}du\\right) = -16 \\int \\frac{1}{u}du = -16 \\ln|u| = -16 \\ln(4-r^2)$\n    (We can drop the absolute value since $4-r^2 > 0$ for $r<2$).\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral with the limit:\n    $\\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\left[ -16 \\ln(4-r^2) \\right]_{0}^{R} = \\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-R^2) - (-16 \\ln(4-0^2)) \\right)$\n    $= \\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\left( -16 \\ln(4-R^2) + 16 \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\n    As $R$ approaches 2 from below, the term $4-R^2$ approaches $0^{+}$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(z)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $z \\to 0^{+}$. Therefore:\n    $\\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\ln(4-R^2) = -\\infty$\n\n    The value of the integral is:\n    $(-16) \\cdot (-\\infty) + 16 \\ln(4) = +\\infty$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n\n    The integral for the area diverges to infinity.\n    $A = 2\\pi \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\n    Thus, the area of the given surface is infinite.\n\n<<<D>>>"
