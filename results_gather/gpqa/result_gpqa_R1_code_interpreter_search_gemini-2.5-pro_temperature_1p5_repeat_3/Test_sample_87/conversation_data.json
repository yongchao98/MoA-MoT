    "The user is asking to identify a biological process based on a set of experimental observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (a protein antigen).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, meaning the antigen travels through the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for initiating mucosal immune responses.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates an active immune response, specifically clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have recognized the antigen.\n    *   **Genetic Finding:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\" The variable heavy chain gene is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies it produces.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the findings:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate and humoral immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not directly cause mutations or variability in the genes of B cells.\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, it occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* antigen exposure in a population of cells that is already selected and proliferating. VDJ recombination creates the primary repertoire, not the affinity-matured variability within a specific responding clone.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the effector function of the antibody. It does *not* affect the variable region, which is responsible for antigen binding. Therefore, it does not explain the \"high variability\" observed in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM intentionally introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable region genes (both heavy and light chains). This generates variants of the original B cell receptor. B cells with mutations that lead to higher affinity for the antigen are then preferentially selected to survive and proliferate. This process is the direct cause of the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating, antigen-specific B cell clone.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch with high variability in their variable heavy chain gene after antigen exposure is the classic description of a germinal center reaction, a key feature of which is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
