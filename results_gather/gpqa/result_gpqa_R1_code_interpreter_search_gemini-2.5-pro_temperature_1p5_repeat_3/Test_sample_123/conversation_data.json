    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The number of particles, `N`, that remain after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    Here, `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Account for Time Dilation:**\n    The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their internal \"clock\" runs slower than a stationary clock in the lab. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The particle's lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ₀`) is related to the lifetime observed in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    So, the decay law in the lab frame becomes:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:**\n    The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `R = 30 m`. They travel to the inner wall. The time this takes in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is the distance divided by their speed, `v`.\n    `t_lab = R / v`\n    The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, we can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    We can now substitute the time of flight into the decay equation to find the fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that survive the journey to the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Set up the Problem with Given Scenarios:**\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `K = R / (c * τ₀)`\n    So, the survival fraction `f = N/N₀` is given by:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    We can solve for `K` using the first scenario.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Plugging these into the equation: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    Now, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n        *   The desired survival fraction is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n    `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We now have two expressions for the constant `K`. We can set them equal to each other to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To get the final answer, we compute the value of this expression. We can use Python for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived formula for the new Lorentz factor is gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n>>>\n54.1855685655513\n>>>\n\nThe calculated value for `γ₂` is approximately 54.19.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The available options are:\n    A) 40\n    B) 68\n    C) 54\n    D) 28\n\n    The calculated value of ~54.19 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Core Principles**\n\nThe problem involves two key concepts from special relativity:\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of unstable particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after time `t` follows an exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation:** For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab frame). The lifetime measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ₀`). This relationship is given by `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### **2. Setting up the Equation**\n\n1.  The decay law as observed in the lab frame is:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    Substituting the time-dilated lifetime, we get:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n2.  The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to the inner wall (a distance `R`) is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n3.  Plugging this time into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that survive the journey:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    Let's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)`. The survival fraction `f` is then:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Using the Given Scenarios**\n\nWe are given two scenarios to solve for the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Survival fraction `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n    Plugging these values in:\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    To solve for K, take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Survival fraction `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   We need to find the Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    Plugging these values in:\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n    `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### **4. Solving for the Final Answer**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the constant `K`. We can set them equal to each other to solve for `γ₂`:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value.\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 68\nC) 54\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
