You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Analysis of the experimental setup:** The goal is to express a fusion protein in mammalian cells (CHO cells). The protein consists of an N-terminal HA tag followed by the GADD45G protein. The experiment failed, as the protein was not overexpressed. The provided DNA sequence is the key to solving the problem.\n*   **Sequence breakdown:** A protein-coding sequence on the plus strand of DNA starts with a start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The sequence between them is the open reading frame (ORF). We need to translate the given DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence to see if it makes sense.\n*   **Step 1: Identify the start codon.** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`, which is the correct start codon, coding for Methionine (M).\n*   **Step 2: Translate the HA tag sequence.** The HA tag is an influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant with the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate the DNA sequence following the start codon:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The translated sequence is `M-YPYDVPDYA`. So far, the sequence correctly codes for the start methionine and the HA tag.\n*   **Step 3: Continue translating the sequence.** Now let's look at the DNA sequence immediately following the HA tag's coding sequence (`...TACGCC`):\n    *   The next codon is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (K).\n    *   The codon after that is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The DNA sequence is `5'-ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAA**TGA**...3'`. The `TGA` codon will be transcribed into a `UGA` codon in the messenger RNA (mRNA). When the ribosome encounters this `UGA` stop codon, it will terminate translation. This means that instead of producing the full-length HA-GADD45G protein, the cell will only produce a very short peptide: Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala-Lys. This explains the lack of overexpression of the desired full-length protein.\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. This is incorrect. As shown above, the HA tag sequence is translated correctly.\n    *   B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. While linkers can be important, the primary issue here is that the full protein is never made. The problem is a lack of synthesis, not subsequent degradation.\n    *   C) The ribosome terminated the translation early. This is correct. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon causes the ribosome to fall off the mRNA, halting protein synthesis long before the GADD45G portion is translated.\n    *   D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n\nTherefore, the reason for the failed expression is the early termination of translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
