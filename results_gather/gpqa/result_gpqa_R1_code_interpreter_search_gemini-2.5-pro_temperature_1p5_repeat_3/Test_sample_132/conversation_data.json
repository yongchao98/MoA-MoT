    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, $PO_4^{3-}$, in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the components of the solution:**\n*   We start with $KH_2PO_4$ and $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$.\n*   In water, $KH_2PO_4$ dissociates completely into $K^+$ and $H_2PO_4^-$ (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n*   $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ dissociates completely into $2Na^+$, $HPO_4^{2-}$ (hydrogen phosphate ion), and water.\n*   The key species for our calculation are the weak acid $H_2PO_4^-$ and its conjugate base $HPO_4^{2-}$. They form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of each phosphate species and then their concentration in the 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ (from $KH_2PO_4$):**\n    *   Molar mass ($Mw$) of $KH_2PO_4$ = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n    *   Concentration $[H_2PO_4^-]$ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ (from $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$):**\n    *   Molar mass ($Mw$) of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n    *   Concentration $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$:**\nThe solution is a buffer governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$), which involves the equilibrium between $H_2PO_4^-$ and $HPO_4^{2-}$.\n\n*   Equilibrium reaction: $H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-}$\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n*   The expression for $K_{a2}$ is: $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $[H^+]$:\n$[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n\nSince we have a buffer, the change in concentrations from the initial state to equilibrium is negligible. We can use the initial concentrations calculated in step 2.\n$[H^+] = (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674 \\ M}{0.02809 \\ M} \\approx 8.11 \\times 10^{-8} \\ M$\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration $[PO_4^{3-}]$:**\nThe orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion ($HPO_4^{2-}$). This is the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   Equilibrium reaction: $HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n*   The expression for $K_{a3}$ is: $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the unknown concentration, $[PO_4^{3-}]$:\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$\n*   $[HPO_4^{2-}] \\approx 0.02809 \\ M$ (from step 2)\n*   $[H^+] \\approx 8.11 \\times 10^{-8} \\ M$ (from step 3)\n\n$[PO_4^{3-}] = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809}{8.11 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.236 \\times 10^{-7} \\ M$\n\nLet's perform a more precise calculation without intermediate rounding.\n```python\n# Moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_kh2po4 = 1.00 / 136.09\nmoles_na2hpo4 = 1.00 / 177.99\n\n# Volume in Liters\nvolume_L = 0.20000\n\n# Concentrations\nconc_h2po4 = moles_kh2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = moles_na2hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Equilibrium constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] -> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] -> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3_minus:.2e}\")\n```\n[Code Output]\n`6.24e-07`\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in the solution:**\n    *   We dissolve $KH_2PO_4$ and $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ in water.\n    *   $KH_2PO_4$ is a salt that dissociates completely into $K^+$ ions and $H_2PO_4^-$ (dihydrogen phosphate) ions.\n    *   $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ is a salt that dissociates completely into $Na^+$ ions, $HPO_4^{2-}$ (hydrogen phosphate) ions, and water molecules.\n    *   Therefore, the primary phosphate species in the solution are $H_2PO_4^-$ (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, $HPO_4^{2-}$. These two form a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   **For $H_2PO_4^-$ (from $KH_2PO_4$):**\n        *   Molar mass ($Mw$) of $KH_2PO_4$ = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of $KH_2PO_4$ = Mass / $Mw$ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles.\n        *   Since $KH_2PO_4$ dissociates 1:1, moles of $H_2PO_4^-$ = 0.007348 moles.\n        *   Initial concentration $[H_2PO_4^-]_{initial}$ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   **For $HPO_4^{2-}$ (from $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$):**\n        *   Molar mass ($Mw$) of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ = 177.99 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of $Na_2HPO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$ = Mass / $Mw$ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles.\n        *   Since $Na_2HPO_4$ dissociates to give one $HPO_4^{2-}$, moles of $HPO_4^{2-}$ = 0.005618 moles.\n        *   Initial concentration $[HPO_4^{2-}]_{initial}$ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the pH or $[H^+]$ of the buffer solution:**\n    *   The buffer system is based on the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$):\n        $H_2PO_4^- (aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + HPO_4^{2-}(aq)$\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this equilibrium is $K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n    *   The expression for $K_{a2}$ is: $K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}$\n    *   We can rearrange this to find the hydrogen ion concentration, $[H^+]$. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but it's more direct to solve for $[H^+]$ here since we need it for the next step.\n    *   $[H^+] = K_{a2} \\times \\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   Using the initial concentrations (as the change is negligible in a buffer):\n        $[H^+] = (6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\frac{0.03674}{0.02809} \\approx 8.114 \\times 10^{-8} \\ M$\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$):**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation step:\n        $HPO_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + PO_4^{3-}(aq)$\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this equilibrium is $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n    *   The expression for $K_{a3}$ is: $K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}$\n    *   We want to find $[PO_4^{3-}]$, so we rearrange the equation:\n        $[PO_4^{3-}] = K_{a3} \\times \\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$\n    *   Now, we plug in the values we have:\n        *   $K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}$\n        *   $[HPO_4^{2-}] \\approx [HPO_4^{2-}]_{initial} = 0.02809 \\ M$ (the amount that dissociates into $PO_4^{3-}$ is extremely small because $K_{a3}$ is so small).\n        *   $[H^+] \\approx 8.114 \\times 10^{-8} \\ M$ (from the buffer calculation in step 3).\n    *   $[PO_4^{3-}] = (1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\frac{0.02809}{8.114 \\times 10^{-8}}$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   This calculation was performed accurately by the Python code.\n    *   The code calculated the concentrations and then the final $[PO_4^{3-}]$ value without intermediate rounding.\n    *   Code Output: `6.24e-07`\n    *   This means the concentration of orthophosphate ions, $[PO_4^{3-}]$, is $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Match with options:**\n    *   The calculated value, $6.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
