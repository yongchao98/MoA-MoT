    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Determine the functional relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) based on mutant phenotypes.\n    *   **System:** White lupine resistance to anthracnose.\n    *   **Knowns:**\n        *   Wild-type (WT) has 100% resistance.\n        *   At least one gene is a transcription factor (a gene that controls the expression of other genes) acting \"upstream.\"\n    *   **Data (Resistance levels):**\n        *   `g1` (G1 knockout): 75%\n        *   `g2` (G2 knockout): 0%\n        *   `g3` (G3 knockout): 50%\n        *   `g1g2` (double knockout): 0%\n        *   `g2g3` (double knockout): 0%\n        *   `g1g3` (double knockout): 10%\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of G2 (The \"Upstream\" Gene):**\n    *   A key concept here is **epistasis**, which occurs when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. In a genetic pathway, a mutation in an \"upstream\" gene is often epistatic to a mutation in a \"downstream\" gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of the upstream single mutant.\n    *   Let's test this with G2:\n        *   Compare `g1g2` (0% resistance) with the single mutants `g1` (75%) and `g2` (0%). The `g1g2` phenotype is identical to the `g2` phenotype. This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n        *   Compare `g2g3` (0% resistance) with the single mutants `g2` (0%) and `g3` (50%). The `g2g3` phenotype is identical to the `g2` phenotype. This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   Since G2's phenotype dominates in both double-mutant combinations, it strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. Combined with the information that one gene is a transcription factor, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is the transcription factor** that is required to activate both G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can function properly (or be expressed), leading to a complete loss of resistance, regardless of whether G1 or G3 are also knocked out.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) both show a partial loss of resistance. This suggests they both contribute to the overall resistance.\n    *   Now, look at the double mutant `g1g3`. Its resistance is 10%.\n    *   If the genes acted in a simple additive way, you might expect the combined loss of function to be the sum of individual losses (a 25% drop from G1 + a 50% drop from G3 = a 75% total drop, leading to 25% resistance). The actual result (10% resistance) shows a much more severe effect than simple addition.\n    *   This synergistic interaction, where the double mutant phenotype is much more severe than the individual mutant phenotypes, is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 have overlapping or compensatory functions. They might act in two parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance. When one pathway is gone, the other can still provide a significant amount of resistance (50% or 75%). But when both are knocked out, the system almost completely fails (only 10% resistance remains).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This matches our analysis.\n        *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* This matches our analysis of the `g1g3` mutant.\n        *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* For this to be true, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). It is not. So, this part is technically incorrect by the classical definition. However, the first two parts are strongly supported.\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   *Pleiotropy* means one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy. This makes the option weak.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* For this to be true, the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) should be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%). It is not. This is incorrect.\n        *   \"Has the same promoter\" is a very specific molecular detail that we can't definitively conclude from this data, whereas \"gene redundancy\" is a functional description that fits well.\n\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* This is incorrect. As shown in step 2, G2 is the upstream gene, not G1. If G1 were the TF for G2, the `g1` mutant should have a 0% resistance phenotype, but it has 75%.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Option A contains two key conclusions that are strongly supported by the data: G2 is the upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are functionally redundant.\n    *   The other options (B, C, D) contain statements that are either clearly contradicted by the data (e.g., \"G1 is a transcription factor\") or are unsupported speculations (e.g., \"pleiotropy\").\n    *   Despite the technical inaccuracy of the \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" clause, Option A is overwhelmingly the best description of the genetic interactions among the choices provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
