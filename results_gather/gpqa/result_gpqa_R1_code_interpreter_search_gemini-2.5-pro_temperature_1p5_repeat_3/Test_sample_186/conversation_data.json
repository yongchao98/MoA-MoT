    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the apparent V magnitude for each star and then use this information to check if it's detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT unit telescope. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a 1-hour exposure.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO User Manual (and confirmed by its Exposure Time Calculator), in the 1-UT mode (using one 8m VLT telescope), ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour for a star with an apparent V magnitude of approximately 16.5. This will be our detection threshold: if a star has V < 16.5, it is detectable.\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky.\n*   Its apparent V magnitude is approximately -0.74.\n*   Since -0.74 < 16.5, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   Polaris (the North Star) is a well-known bright star.\n*   Its apparent V magnitude is approximately +1.98.\n*   Since 1.98 < 16.5, Polaris is **detectable**.\n\nFor stars (c) through (f), we need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (m) using their absolute V magnitude (M) and distance (d). The formula is:\nm = M - 5 + 5 * log10(d)\nwhere d is the distance in parsecs (pc).\nHere, the absolute V magnitude (M) is given as 15 for all these stars.\n\n**c) Star with M = 15 mag at d = 10 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10)\n*   m = 10 + 5 * 1\n*   m = 15\n*   Since 15 < 16.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M = 15 mag at d = 200 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200)\n*   m = 10 + 5 * (2.301)\n*   m = 10 + 11.505\n*   m = 21.505\n*   Since 21.505 > 16.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M = 15 mag at d = 5 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5)\n*   m = 10 + 5 * (0.699)\n*   m = 10 + 3.495\n*   m = 13.495\n*   Since 13.495 < 16.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M = 15 mag at d = 50 pc:**\n*   m = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50)\n*   m = 10 + 5 * (1.699)\n*   m = 10 + 8.495\n*   m = 18.495\n*   Since 18.495 > 16.5, this star is **not detectable**.\n\nIn summary:\n*   a) Canopus: Detectable\n*   b) Polaris: Detectable\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: Detectable\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: Not Detectable\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: Detectable\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: Not Detectable\n\nThe detectable stars are (a), (b), (c), and (e). This gives a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
