    "**1. Analysis of Compound X's Structure using IR and NMR Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet (bs) for a single proton is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR interpretation.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). They appear as doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is characteristic of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂). This suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂) of the ethyl fragment. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to both the adjacent -CH₃ and another proton.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine proton (-CH). It's bonded to the aromatic ring (making it a benzylic proton), the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm). This explains why it's a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        *   We have a benzoic acid core.\n        *   The other substituent on the benzene ring, in the para position, is an alkyl group.\n        *   Putting the alkyl fragments together: The methine group (-CH-) is attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n        *   Therefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D), which is the starting material.\n\n**2. The Chemical Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X) and red phosphorus with hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring to a methyl group (-CH₃). Alkyl groups, being already saturated, are unaffected.\n\n**3. Identifying the Final Product**\n\n*   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The sec-butyl group at the para position will remain unchanged.\n*   The benzene ring will also remain unchanged.\n*   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n**4. Matching with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This is still a carboxylic acid.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches the product derived from the reduction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
