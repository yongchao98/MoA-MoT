    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a very broad O-H stretch, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the suspected carboxylic acid group:\n    *   Fragment: [COOH]⁺\n    *   Mass = (1 × Mass of Carbon) + (2 × Mass of Oxygen) + (1 × Mass of Hydrogen)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 1.01) ≈ 45\n    *   This m/z = 45 fragment is a very common and diagnostic cleavage pattern for carboxylic acids, resulting from the loss of the alkyl chain. This strongly confirms the presence of the -COOH functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\nThe spectroscopic data reveals that the unknown molecule must contain:\n1.  A C=C double bond (from FTIR and NMR). This accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n2.  A C=O double bond within the carboxylic acid group (from FTIR and MS). This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**. It must also contain at least two oxygen atoms to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for each of the given options using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and the required 2 degrees of unsaturation. This is a perfect match.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula only has one oxygen and an incorrect DoU.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula has an incorrect DoU; it would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. While the DoU is correct, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the clear evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (presence of a carboxylic acid, an alkene, and a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
