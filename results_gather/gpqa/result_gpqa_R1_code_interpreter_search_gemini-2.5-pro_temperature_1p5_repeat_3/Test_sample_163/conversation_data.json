    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of binary system_1 (M1) to the total mass of binary system_2 (M2). This ratio is expressed as M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Key Information:** Both systems are described as \"double-lined spectroscopic binaries\" (since radial velocities for both stars are given) and are \"eclipsing\".\n\n3.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\n    M_total = M1 + M2 = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the \"Eclipsing\" Information:**\n    The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial detail because eclipses can only occur when the orbital plane is nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` must be very close to 90 degrees. For an inclination of 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. We can assume this ideal case for both systems as a reasonable approximation.\n\n5.  **Set Up the Mass Ratio Calculation:**\n    We need to find the ratio M1_total / M2_total. Let's write out the expressions for each system's total mass:\n    *   M1_total = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁))\n    *   M2_total = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂))\n\n    Now, form the ratio:\n    M1_total / M2_total = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₁)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i₂)) ]\n\n    The term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out. Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume sin³(i₁) ≈ sin³(i₂) ≈ 1, so this term also cancels. The formula simplifies to:\n    M1_total / M2_total = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)\n\n6.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    First, calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system:\n    *   System 1: K1_sum = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   System 2: K2_sum = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Now substitute these sums and the periods into the ratio formula. The units (years for period, km/s for velocity) will cancel out, so we can use the numerical values directly.\n    *   P1 = 2\n    *   P2 = 1\n    *   K1_sum = 15\n    *   K2_sum = 25\n\n    M1_total / M2_total = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\n    M1_total / M2_total = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\n    M1_total / M2_total = 6750 / 15625\n\n    To find the decimal value, perform the division. A simple python script can do this accurately.\n\n```python\n# Periods in years\nP1 = 2\nP2 = 1\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes in km/s for each system\nK_sum_1 = 10 + 5\nK_sum_2 = 15 + 10\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1/M2)\n# The formula is (P1 * (K_sum_1)^3) / (P2 * (K_sum_2)^3)\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_sum_1)**3) / (P2 * (K_sum_2)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.7\n    C) ~ 0.4\n    D) ~ 0.6\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. Therefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n\n### **1. Identify the relevant physical principles**\nThe total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2) using the following formula, which is a derivative of Kepler's Third Law:\n\n`M1 + M2 = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))`\n\nWhere:\n- `M1 + M2` is the total mass of the system.\n- `P` is the orbital period.\n- `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n- `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n### **2. Simplify the formula for a ratio calculation**\nWe need to calculate the ratio `M_sys1 / M_sys2`:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i2)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(2 * pi * G)` cancels out from the numerator and denominator.\n\n### **3. Use the information about eclipses**\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. Eclipses can only occur when the orbital plane is nearly edge-on to an observer. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\n- For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`.\n- Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume `sin^3(i1) ≈ 1` and `sin^3(i2) ≈ 1`. This allows the `sin^3(i)` term to be removed from our ratio calculation.\n\nThe simplified formula for the mass ratio becomes:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3)`\n\n### **4. Substitute the given values**\nLet's plug in the data for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n- Period `P1` = 2 years\n- Sum of RV amplitudes `(K1a + K1b)` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n- Period `P2` = 1 year\n- Sum of RV amplitudes `(K2a + K2b)` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432`\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThe calculation shows that the mass of system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2. Comparing this result to the given options:\n- A) ~ 1.2\n- B) ~ 0.7\n- C) ~ 0.4\n- D) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
