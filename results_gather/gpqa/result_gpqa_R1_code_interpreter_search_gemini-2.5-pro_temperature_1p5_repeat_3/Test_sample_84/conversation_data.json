    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A_p)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n- T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n- R_star is the radius of the star.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n- A_p is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same for both) and have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((1 / a_1) / (1 / a_2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the orbital distances, a_2 / a_1.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Distance to Given Observational Data**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet on the star. The maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star.\n\nThe formula for the Doppler shift is Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c, where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum stellar radial velocity, so:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a) by the following relation (assuming a circular orbit and M_p << M_star):\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\nwhere `i` is the inclination of the orbit. Since the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, meaning i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1. We can assume `sin(i)` is the same for both planets.\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1)**\nLet's rearrange the formula for K to solve for `a`:\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na ≈ (M_p² * sin²(i) * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, let's form the ratio a_2 / a_1. All terms that are constant for both systems (G, M_star, sin²(i)) will cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2² / K₂²)] / [(M_p1² / K₁²)]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratios of Masses and RV Amplitudes**\n- **Mass Ratio:**\n  M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n  M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n  (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n\n- **RV Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):**\n  K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n  Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n  Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n  (K₁ / K₂) = (Δλ₁) / (Δλ₂) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Ratio**\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equations.\n- First, for the semi-major axes:\n  a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n- Now, for the equilibrium temperatures:\n  (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is sqrt(a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# Mp2/Mp1 = 5/7\n# K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4\n\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\nk_ratio_1_over_2 = 3 / 4\n\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (k_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet, T_eq, is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)) / (T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4))`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ((1/a1)^(1/2)) / ((1/a2)^(1/2)) = (a2/a1)^(1/2)`\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, K, is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and semi-major axis (a) for a circular orbit (and assuming M_p << M_star) by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(1/2)) * (G/a)^(1/2)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and i is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbital inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2/a1. The terms G, M_star, and sin(i) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the observed maximum Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c and λ_0 are constants. Therefore, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2.\n\nWe are given:\n- M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n- M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n- Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n- M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n- K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we calculate a2/a1:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28`\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
