    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> (or |3,0,0>) to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0> (or |1,0,0>) via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n    The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1\n    *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn is not restricted but must change for emission/absorption. In this decay process, n decreases.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition Step:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0>.\n    *   For the first transition, we apply the selection rules:\n        *   Δl = ±1: Since the initial l=0, the orbital quantum number of the intermediate state must be l'=1.\n        *   Δn < 0: The principal quantum number n must decrease. The lowest possible state with l=1 is n=2 (since l < n). So the intermediate state must have n'=2.\n        *   Δm = 0, ±1: Starting from m=0, the magnetic quantum number of the intermediate state, m', can be -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   Therefore, the first transition must be from |3,0,0> to one of the |2,1,m'> states, where m' can be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The problem implies the decay happens via the n=2 level as it is the only possible intermediate p-state (l=1) for a decay cascade from 3s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition Step:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m'>.\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0>.\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for this step:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_initial = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0 - m'. To satisfy the Δm=0, ±1 rule, m' must be -1, 0, or 1, which it is.\n    *   Thus, any of the intermediate states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1> can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. The transition route must be of the form |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>. This confirms that the routes presented in options A, C, and D are all physically allowed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    We now need to find the probability of a specific cascade occurring. This is a product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step (P₁):**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> is a 3s state, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external polarizing fields, there is no preferred direction of decay. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into each of the available final m' sublevels.\n        The possible final states for the first step are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. There are three such states.\n        The 3s state can only decay via E1 to a p-state. The only energetically accessible p-state is the 2p state (|2,1,m'>). Therefore, the total probability of decay from 3s to 2p is 1. This probability is split equally among the three m' sublevels.\n        So, the probability of decaying into any specific sublevel is:\n        P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>) = 1/3, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step (P₂):**\n        The intermediate state is |2,1,m'> (a 2p state). It needs to decay to a lower energy state. According to E1 selection rules (Δl=±1), it can decay to an s-state (l=0) or a d-state (l=2). Since n must be less than 2, the only available state is the n=1 state, which requires l=0 (1s state, |1,0,0>). A 1d state does not exist.\n        Therefore, the 2p state has only one possible E1 decay channel: the 1s state.\n        This means that once the atom is in any |2,1,m'> state, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n        P(|2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>) = 1, for m' = -1, 0, 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability of a specific cascade:**\n        The total probability for a specific route is P_total = P₁ * P₂.\n        Let's calculate this for the route given in option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) * P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n        P_total = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3}. This matches our calculation. The route is valid and the probability is correct.\n    *   B) Route is garbled, but the probability of 2/3 is incorrect for a single cascade path.\n    *   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4}. The route is valid, but the calculated probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
