    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is C_n H_m.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m ≈ 12n`, or `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). Alkanes have the formula C_n H_{2n+2}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). Let's call the other liquid D.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This means D also must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenating Z (a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenating D must therefore also yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z but be unsaturated. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a typical alkene or alkyne. This strongly indicates that D is an aromatic compound (an arene). Aromatic compounds only react with hydrogen under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) and do not react with bromine water.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane C_n H_{2n}, and D is the corresponding aromatic compound (arene) with the formula C_n H_{2n-6} (for a single benzene ring structure).\n    *   This structure requires n ≥ 6, as the smallest aromatic ring is benzene (C₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only substance Z. This means both A and B, when hydrogenated, form Z. Thus, A and B must also have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z and D. They must be cycloalkenes or cyclodienes.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   Since A and B are cycloalkenes/dienes that form the cycloalkane Z, and D is an aromatic compound, the most logical composition for A and B is one cycloalkene and one cyclodiene.\n        *   Let A be the cycloalkene: C_n H_{2n-2}.\n        *   Let B be the cyclodiene: C_n H_{2n-4}.\n    *   The reaction becomes: C_n H_{2n-2} (A) + C_n H_{2n-4} (B) → C_n H_{2n} (Z) + C_n H_{2n-6} (D).\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: Left side = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. Right side = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is balanced.\n        *   The cycloalkene (A) is hydrogenated to the cycloalkane (Z), and the cyclodiene (B) is dehydrogenated to the aromatic compound (D). This is a plausible disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) that produces an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X.\n    *   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. This means the cyclodiene (B) must have isolated double bonds (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n' and the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in A and B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   We need to find 'n'. The problem is constructed such that the answer should be one of the options. Let's test the options that correspond to integer values of n.\n        *   A) 18: If 4n-6 = 18, then 4n = 24, which gives n=6. This is a valid solution.\n        *   B) 12: If 4n-6 = 12, then 4n = 18, which gives n=4.5 (not an integer).\n        *   C) 22: If 4n-6 = 22, then 4n = 28, which gives n=7. This is also a valid solution.\n        *   D) 16: If 4n-6 = 16, then 4n = 22, which gives n=5.5 (not an integer).\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **Scenario n=6:** Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), D is benzene (C₆H₆). A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), and B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **Scenario n=7:** Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), D is toluene (C₇H₈). A is methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), and B is a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀). Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of further information, chemistry problems of this type usually refer to the most fundamental parent compounds. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the quintessential example of this type of chemistry, often used as the primary illustration in textbooks. Therefore, it is the most probable intended answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
