    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide oxygen (atom 7) bridges carbons 1 and 6. This is a cis-fused system.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl` indicates methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)` defines the absolute configuration at these chiral centers.\n\n*   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent.\n    *   In reactions with epoxides, Gilman reagents act as a source of a soft carbanion nucleophile, in this case, a methyl anion (`Me⁻`).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Epoxide ring opening with an organocuprate.\n    *   The problem provides two key rules for this reaction type:\n        1.  The nucleophile (`Me⁻`) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack\n\n1.  The epoxide ring is formed between C1 and C6. We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons.\n2.  **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system. It is a **quaternary carbon**.\n3.  **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system. It is a **tertiary carbon**.\n4.  A hydrogen atom is much smaller than a methyl group. Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n5.  According to the rule provided, the `Me⁻` nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\nThis conclusion immediately allows us to eliminate options that would result from an attack at C1. Attack at C1 would lead to a `2,2,...-tetramethyl...` product structure (the original methyl at C1 plus the new one). Therefore, options C and D, which have this structure (`2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`), can be eliminated. The product must be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` derivative, as given in options A and B.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\n\nThe reaction involves three main stereochemical events:\n1.  **Attack at C6:** The configuration at C6 is inverted.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks, and the epoxide oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 after acidic workup.\n3.  **Other Centers:** The chiral centers not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n\nLet's trace the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product:\n\n*   **New Numbering:** The product is a cyclohexanol. By IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. To get the lowest locants for the methyl groups, we number the ring clockwise. The new numbering scheme relates to the old one as follows:\n    *   `new C1` ← `old C1`\n    *   `new C2` ← `old C6`\n    *   `new C3` ← `old C5`\n    *   `new C4` ← `old C4`\n    *   `new C5` ← `old C3`\n    *   `new C6` ← `old C2`\n    The methyl groups are located at `new C1`, `new C2`, `new C4`, and `new C5`. This confirms the product is a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.\n\n*   **Determine R/S for each center in the product:**\n    *   **New C1 (from old C1):** The configuration is retained. The reactant is `(1R)`. Thus, the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from old C6):** The configuration is inverted. The reactant is `(6S)`. Inversion of (S) gives (R). Thus, the product is **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from old C4):** The configuration is retained. The reactant is `(4R)`. Thus, the product is **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from old C3):** The configuration is retained. The reactant is `(3R)`. Thus, the product is **(5R)**.\n\n*   **Final Product:** Combining these results, the product has the stereochemistry `(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
