    "An analysis of each compound is required to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. A molecule exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls have two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.\n    *   The molecule is substituted at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') with bulky groups: methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) and nitro (-NO2).\n    *   Due to the large size of these substituents, they cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane (non-coplanar).\n    *   This twisted, non-planar conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   A molecule with this type of axial chirality due to hindered rotation is called an atropisomer. Since it is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of exhibiting optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂CO, which consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule is not chiral. Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Since the molecule has both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\nTherefore, the correct choice includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
