    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Observational Constraints**\n\nFor a star to be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, it must satisfy the conditions for both instruments regarding apparent magnitude and sky visibility from the observatory's location.\n\n**A. Apparent Magnitude Constraint:**\n*   ESPRESSO (Paranal) can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   HIRES (Keck) can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n*   To be observable by **both**, a star must meet the stricter requirement, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16 mag**.\n\n**B. Declination (Sky Visibility) Constraint:**\nA star must rise above the horizon to be observed. This depends on the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n*   **Keck Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately +20° N. A star is visible if its declination is greater than the latitude minus 90°.\n    *   Visibility Limit: DEC > 20° - 90° = -70°.\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at a latitude of approximately -25° S. A star is visible if its declination is less than the latitude plus 90°.\n    *   Visibility Limit: DEC < -25° + 90° = +65°.\n*   For a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the shared range: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Star**\n\nNow, we will evaluate each star against these two constraints: **V < 16 mag** and **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (m_V) when the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `d` is the distance in parsecs and `A_V` is the interstellar absorption. The absorption `A_V` is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_star(name, dec, V_mag=None, M_V=None, d_pc=None, E_BV=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a star's observability from both Keck and Paranal.\n    \n    Returns True if observable by both, False otherwise.\n    Prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Declination Check\n    dec_observable = -70 < dec < 65\n    \n    # 2. Apparent Magnitude Calculation & Check\n    apparent_V = V_mag\n    if M_V is not None and d_pc is not None:\n        A_V = 0\n        if E_BV is not None:\n            A_V = 3.1 * E_BV\n        \n        # Distance Modulus: m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5 + A\n        apparent_V = M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc) - 5 + A_V\n\n    mag_observable = apparent_V < 16\n    \n    print(f\"--- Analyzing {name} ---\")\n    print(f\"Declination: {dec} deg. Pass: {dec_observable}\")\n    print(f\"Apparent V Magnitude: {apparent_V:.2f} mag. Pass: {mag_observable}\")\n    \n    is_fully_observable = dec_observable and mag_observable\n    print(f\"Result: Observable by both? {is_fully_observable}\\n\")\n    return is_fully_observable\n\n# --- Evaluate Each Star ---\nis_star1_obs = analyze_star(\"Star 1\", dec=-75, M_V=15.5, d_pc=10)\nis_star2_obs = analyze_star(\"Star 2\", dec=55, V_mag=16.5)\nis_star3_obs = analyze_star(\"Star 3\", dec=48, V_mag=15.5, E_BV=0.6, d_pc=15)\nis_star4_obs = analyze_star(\"Star 4\", dec=-48, M_V=15.5, d_pc=10, E_BV=0.4)\nis_star5_obs = analyze_star(\"Star 5\", dec=60, M_V=16.5, d_pc=5)\n\n```\n<execute_output>\n--- Analyzing Star 1 ---\nDeclination: -75 deg. Pass: False\nApparent V Magnitude: 15.50 mag. Pass: True\nResult: Observable by both? False\n\n--- Analyzing Star 2 ---\nDeclination: 55 deg. Pass: True\nApparent V Magnitude: 16.50 mag. Pass: False\nResult: Observable by both? False\n\n--- Analyzing Star 3 ---\nDeclination: 48 deg. Pass: True\nApparent V Magnitude: 15.50 mag. Pass: True\nResult: Observable by both? True\n\n--- Analyzing Star 4 ---\nDeclination: -48 deg. Pass: True\nApparent V Magnitude: 16.74 mag. Pass: False\nResult: Observable by both? False\n\n--- Analyzing Star 5 ---\nDeclination: 60 deg. Pass: True\nApparent V Magnitude: 15.00 mag. Pass: True\nResult: Observable by both? True\n\n</execute_output>\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n*   **Star 1:** Fails the declination check.\n*   **Star 2:** Fails the apparent magnitude check.\n*   **Star 3:** **Passes** both the declination and apparent magnitude checks.\n*   **Star 4:** Fails the apparent magnitude check.\n*   **Star 5:** **Passes** both the declination and apparent magnitude checks.\n\nTherefore, the two stars that can be detected with both spectrographs are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the detailed analysis from the executed code, here is the breakdown of each star's observability:\n\n*   **Star 1:** Is not observable because its declination of -75° is outside the observable range for the Keck Observatory (DEC > -70°).\n*   **Star 2:** Is not observable because its apparent magnitude of 16.5 mag is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph (V < 16 mag).\n*   **Star 3:** **Is observable**. Its declination of 48° is visible from both observatories, and its apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is bright enough for both spectrographs.\n*   **Star 4:** Is not observable. Although its declination is fine, after accounting for interstellar absorption, its apparent magnitude becomes 16.74 mag, which is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Star 5:** **Is observable**. Its declination of 60° is visible from both locations, and its calculated apparent magnitude of ~15.0 mag is bright enough for both instruments.\n\nTherefore, the two stars that can be detected by both instruments are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
