    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The structure is:\n        ```\n           Cl   CH3\n            \\ /\n             C=C\n            / \\\n           H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These are Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notations that describe the absolute configuration at two specific chiral centers (carbons 3a and 7a). The fact that a specific enantiomer is named indicates that the molecule is chiral. A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This compound is not a meso compound because it lacks the necessary internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The two chiral centers are identically substituted (both are bonded to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). For such molecules, three stereoisomers exist: a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and a meso form (R,S). The (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry between the two carbon atoms. A compound with chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is the (R,R) isomer. It is the enantiomer of the (S,S) isomer and a diastereomer of the meso (R,S) form. The (R,R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereodescriptor `(R)`, indicating that a specific enantiomer is being described. Let's verify the chirality. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring path -CH2-CH=CH- (C2-C3-C4), and the ring path -CH2-CH2-CH= (C6-C5-C4). Since these two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer `(R)` is specified, so it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the symmetric 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers. For example, at C1, the path C1-C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6 is identical to the path C1-C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2. Thus, the two ring attachments to C1 are identical. The same applies to C3 and C5. Furthermore, any stereoisomer of this compound (e.g., all-cis or cis-trans) will possess at least one plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-`cis` isomer has three planes of symmetry. The notation (1s,3s,5s) is non-standard, but it cannot make an inherently achiral structure chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for any chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of -CH2- groups. No chiral center.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C2 (-CH2-) is not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C3 is bonded to a H, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active:** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active:** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active:** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
