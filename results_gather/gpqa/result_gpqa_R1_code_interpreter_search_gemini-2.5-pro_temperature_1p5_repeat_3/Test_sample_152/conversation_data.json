These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH).\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the mixture. The α-protons of dimethyl malonate (the protons on the carbon between the two ester carbonyls) are highly acidic (pKa ≈ 13). NaOEt removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt <=> [⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂]Na⁺ + EtOH`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Due to conjugation with the carbonyl group, the β-carbon is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n    *   **Step 1 (Attack):** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon of `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The intermediate is protonated to give the neutral product.\n    *   **Product Structure:** A new C-C bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final structure is:\n        `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The product has three methyl ester groups. We can name it as a substituted tricarboxylate on a propane backbone.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   Parent: propane (`C3-C2-C1`)\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   At C1: Two `-COOCH₃` groups (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`)\n        *   At C2: One `-p-tolyl` group\n        *   At C3: One `-COOCH₃` group (`-CH₂COOCH₃`)\n    *   Assembling this gives: `(CH₃OOC)CH₂(3) - CH(2)(p-Tolyl) - CH(1)(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   Rearranging our derived product gives `(CH₃OOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH₂COOCH₃`, which matches the structure derived from the name.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), then H₃O⁺.\n*   **Type:** Stork Enamine Alkylation (a Michael addition variant).\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are electron-rich and act as nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C=C double bond carbon not attached to the nitrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an intermediate containing an iminium ion and a nitrile enolate. The subsequent acidic workup (H₃O⁺) has two functions:\n    *   It protonates the nitrile enolate.\n    *   It hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone (cyclohexanone).\n\n4.  **Determine the Product (B):** The net result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at its α-position.\n    *   The original ketone is cyclohexanone.\n    *   The group added to the α-carbon (C2) comes from but-2-enenitrile. The point of attachment is the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The fragment from the nitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanone ring with this group at C2.\n    *   Let's name the product as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`-CH₂-CH₂-CN` isn't right). The main chain is `butanenitrile`, so `C4H₃-C3H-C2H₂-C1N`. The substituent is attached at C3.\n    *   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring attached at C2, which is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto tautomer is the major, most stable product. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is the enol form, which is not the major final product under these conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Type:** Michael Addition (Retrosynthesis problem).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Reactant:** We need to find reactant C.\n    *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. This means we have a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group attached to C2. The C2 position is the CH₂ group between the two carbonyls.\n    *   Structure of the (3-oxobutyl) group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Reactant/Michael Acceptor: `but-3-en-2-one`, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   The MVK fragment in the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is formed when a nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   The new bond is between this β-carbon and the nucleophile. In the product, this bond is to C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   This implies that the nucleophile must be the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The protons on C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups and are readily removed by a base like KOH.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:** The nucleophile (enolate) is formed from reactant C. Therefore, reactant C must be the precursor to this enolate.\n    *   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
