    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n1.  **Understand the Concept of Regularization:** Regularization is a technique used in physics, particularly in quantum field theory (QFT), to deal with divergent quantities, specifically integrals that become infinite. These infinities often arise when considering processes at very high energies or, equivalently, very short distances. This is known as an ultraviolet (UV) divergence. Regularization works by introducing a new, non-physical parameter, called a regulator or cutoff, to make these integrals finite. After regularization, a related process called renormalization is used to absorb the infinities into the definitions of physical parameters (like mass and charge), yielding finite and physically meaningful predictions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. When calculating physical quantities in QED, such as the correction to an electron's magnetic moment, one encounters loop diagrams. These diagrams involve integrals over all possible momenta of virtual particles, and these integrals diverge at high momenta (high energies). Therefore, QED critically depends on the procedures of regularization and renormalization to make sense of these infinities and produce its remarkably accurate predictions. So, QED *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that aims to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. One of its primary motivations and most celebrated features is that it naturally resolves the high-energy divergences that plague quantum field theories. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional, vibrating \"strings.\" This extended nature of strings \"smears out\" their interactions in spacetime. As a result, the calculations of scattering amplitudes (which replace the loop diagrams of QFT) do not produce the short-distance singularities that lead to UV divergences. String theory is believed to be \"UV-complete,\" meaning its predictions are finite at all energy scales without the need for regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. While it is a classical theory and does not have the loop diagrams of QFT, it possesses its own high-energy/short-distance problem. If one models the electron as a true point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its \"self-energy\") is infinite. This divergence occurs as the distance from the point charge approaches zero. To get a finite answer, one must introduce a cutoff, for example, by assuming the electron has a small but finite radius. This can be seen as a form of regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics, in its simplest formulation with point charges, is not free from high-energy problems and can be said to require a form of regularization to handle them.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory based on similar principles. Calculations in QCD also involve loop diagrams that lead to ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Consequently, QCD requires regularization and renormalization to make finite, physical predictions.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   QED and QCD are quantum field theories that are well-known to require regularization.\n    *   Classical Electrodynamics has a singularity problem (infinite self-energy) at short distances, which requires some form of ad-hoc fix or cutoff, essentially a type of regularization.\n    *   Superstring Theory is unique among the options as it is constructed in a way that is expected to be free of high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, thus not requiring the procedure of regularization. The finite size of the string acts as a natural regulator.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the theory listed that never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
