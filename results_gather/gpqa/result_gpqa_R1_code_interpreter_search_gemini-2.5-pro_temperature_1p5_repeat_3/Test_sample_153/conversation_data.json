    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is another peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). The ratio of the intensities of the M⁺ to M⁺+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine (Cl) atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** Carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically exchange rapidly, so they do not show coupling to adjacent protons, appearing as a singlet.\n    *   This signal confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region:** Both signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm).\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single structure:\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl.\n*   From IR & ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: The -COOH and -Cl groups are in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring.\n\nThis structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group required by the IR and the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. The molecular weight (C₇H₅ClO₂ gives MW=156 for ³⁵Cl), functional groups (carboxylic acid), and substitution pattern (*para*) all perfectly match the provided data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it has the correct formula and functional groups, its *ortho* substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
