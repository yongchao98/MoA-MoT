    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the functional groups present.**\n    *   The signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** is a classic signature for the methyl group of an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). The '3H' indicates three protons, and the 's' (singlet) indicates there are no adjacent protons, which is true for the methyl group in an acetate moiety. All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the signals in the vinylic region.**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm** are in the region typical for protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H), known as vinylic protons. The integral of '1H' for each confirms there is one proton of each type. This indicates a disubstituted double bond of the type R-CH=CH-R'.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the double bond.**\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet ('d') with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. Coupling constants (J-values) between vinylic protons are highly diagnostic of the double bond's stereochemistry.\n        *   A J-value of ~12-18 Hz is characteristic of a **trans** arrangement.\n        *   A J-value of ~6-12 Hz is characteristic of a **cis** arrangement.\n    *   The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons are **trans** to each other. This allows us to eliminate the *Cis* options: Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the identity of the alkyl group attached to the double bond.**\n    *   We are left with Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n        *   **Trans-propenyl acetate:** CH₃-CH=CH-OAc\n        *   **Trans-butenyl acetate:** CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-OAc\n    *   Let's look at the splitting patterns of the vinylic protons. The proton at **5.5 ppm** shows a splitting pattern of **'dq'** (doublet of quartets).\n        *   The **doublet ('d')** part comes from its coupling to the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm), which is consistent.\n        *   The **quartet ('q')** part means it is coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   In **Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-OAc)**, the proton at the C-2 position is adjacent to the C-1 vinylic proton and the three protons of the methyl group. This perfectly matches the 'dq' splitting pattern.\n    *   In **Trans-butenyl acetate (CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-OAc)**, the corresponding proton would be adjacent to the other vinylic proton (giving a doublet) and the two protons of the methylene (CH₂) group (giving a triplet). Its splitting pattern would be a doublet of triplets ('dt'), not a doublet of quartets.\n\n*   **Step 5: Confirm the remaining signals.**\n    *   The signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** is for the methyl group attached to the double bond in Trans-propenyl acetate. It is split into a **doublet ('d')** by the single adjacent vinylic proton (the one at 5.5 ppm), which is consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The large J-value (16.0 Hz) indicates a trans double bond. The doublet of quartets ('dq') signal at 5.5 ppm indicates that the vinylic proton is adjacent to both another vinylic proton and a methyl group. This uniquely identifies the structure as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
