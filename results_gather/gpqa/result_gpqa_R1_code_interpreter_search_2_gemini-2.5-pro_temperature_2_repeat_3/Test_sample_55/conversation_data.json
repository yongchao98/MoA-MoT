    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\nThe question describes a decay process for a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not in a single step, but via a two-step process involving an intermediate state. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The notation used is $|n, l, m\\rangle$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Transition Selection Rules\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers of the initial and final states must satisfy the following selection rules:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This implies that $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$ must be an odd integer. For one-photon E1 transitions, this simplifies to $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Angular momentum projection:** The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** There is no restrictive rule for $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$. For a decay (spontaneous emission), energy must be released, which means the energy of the final state must be lower than the initial state ($E_{final} < E_{initial}$), which generally implies $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n### 3. Determining the Transition Route\nLet the intermediate state be $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$. The process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 1}} |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Step 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l_{int} = 1$. (Since $l$ cannot be negative).\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m_{int}$ can be $0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   Since it's a decay, $n_{int}$ must be less than 3. The lowest possible value for $n$ that allows $l=1$ is $n=2$. All the given options suggest the intermediate state has $n_{int}=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: $|n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states are allowed:\n    *   Intermediate state: $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ (with $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$).\n    *   Applying selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m_{int}$. Since $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, $\\Delta m$ can be $1, 0, -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ rule.\n*   So, all three potential intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. This means all the transition routes proposed in the options A, B, C, D are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. Since there are three possible routes for the decay cascade, we need to find the probability of choosing one specific path. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\nThe rate of an E1 transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f |e\\vec{r}| i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nFor the first step, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$, the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). The three possible final states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, belong to the $2p$ subshell. In the absence of external fields, these three states are degenerate (have the same energy).\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropic nature of the decay process (summed over all photon polarizations and emission directions), the transition probability from the single initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three degenerate final states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) is identical.\n\nThis can be shown more formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate to a specific sublevel $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For a transition from an $l=0$ state, the relevant squared coefficient is $|\\langle l,m; k,q | l',m' \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 0,0; 1,m' | 1,m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all three possible final values of $m' = -1, 0, 1$. Since the radial part of the matrix element is also independent of $m'$, the transition rates are equal.\n\nLet $P(m_{int})$ be the probability of transitioning to the state with magnetic quantum number $m_{int}$. Then:\n$P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)$\n\nSince these are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step (from the $3s$ state, decay is only possible to an $np$ state, and the only one with lower energy is $2p$), the probabilities must sum to 1:\n$P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n$3 \\times P(0) = 1 \\implies P(0) = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSo, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, the probabilities for the paths via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ are also both $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFor the second step, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, this is the only allowed E1 decay channel from the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, as any other transition would violate energy conservation ($n$ must decrease) or the selection rules. Therefore, once the atom is in the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state, it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability 1.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{route} = P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nComparing our result with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect probability.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. Incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation for both the route and the probability.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$. Incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
