    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between wavelength shift and radial velocity.**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the Doppler shift in the host star's light. The wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the amplitude of the radial velocity signal, denoted as $K$.\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    Since we are interested in the maximum shift, we have:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$\n    The problem gives us the periodic wavelength shifts for two systems:\n    *   System 1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   System 2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n2.  **Relate the RV amplitude (K) to the orbital parameters.**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude of the star is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{2 \\pi a_{star}}{T} \\sin(i)$\n    where $T$ is the orbital period, $a_{star}$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the system's barycenter, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n    The star's orbital semi-major axis ($a_{star}$) is related to the planet's semi-major axis ($a$) by the center of mass relation:\n    $M_{star} a_{star} = M_{planet} a \\implies a_{star} = a \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}}$\n\n    Substituting this into the equation for $K$:\n    $K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{T} \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} \\sin(i)$\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the planet's semi-major axis ($a$) to its orbital period ($T$):\n    $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + M_{planet})} a^3$\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$), we can approximate this as:\n    $T^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_{star}}$\n    The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$). Therefore, for both systems, we have the same proportionality:\n    $a^3 \\propto T^2 \\implies a \\propto T^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Combine the relationships to find how K depends on T.**\n    From step 2, we have $K \\propto \\frac{a}{T}$ (since $M_{planet}$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin(i)$ are the same for both systems; we assume the inclinations are statistically likely to be similar or, for simplicity in such problems, equal).\n    From step 3, we have $a \\propto T^{2/3}$.\n    Substituting the relation for $a$ into the one for $K$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{T^{2/3}}{T} = T^{2/3 - 1} = T^{-1/3}$\n\n    So, the RV amplitude $K$ is proportional to the orbital period $T$ to the power of -1/3.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n    From the proportionality $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, we can write the relationship between the two systems as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n    From step 1, we know $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    Substituting this value:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n6.  **Compute the numerical value.**\n    Now we perform the final calculation to get the decimal value.\n    ```python\n    print(125 / 343)\n    ```\n    <execute_code>\n    </execute_code>\n    0.3644314868804665\n\n    The result is approximately 0.36.\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
