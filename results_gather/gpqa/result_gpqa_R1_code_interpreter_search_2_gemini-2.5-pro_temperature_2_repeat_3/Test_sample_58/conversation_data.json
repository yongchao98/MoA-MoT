    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The first step is to determine the number of moles of the acidic and basic species. The subsequent steps involve neutralizing these species and then calculating the pH based on the final composition of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each reactant**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L\n    *   Moles of H+ = Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely to provide two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.09 moles = 0.18 moles\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will first neutralize the strong acid (H+ from HCl) because this reaction goes to completion.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 moles\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 moles\n    *   H+ is the limiting reactant. All 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 moles - 0.08 moles = 0.10 moles\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will neutralize the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 moles\n    *   Initial moles of OH- (from step 1) = 0.10 moles\n    *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.10 moles - 0.05 moles = 0.05 moles\n    *   Moles of conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed = 0.05 moles\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH will be determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) is negligible due to the common ion effect from the excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14 (at 25 °C)\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\nLet's check the provided options:\nA) 8.68\nB) 8.92\nC) 12.62\nD) 1.38\n\nOur calculated pH of 12.62 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
