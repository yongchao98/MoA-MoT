    "This problem requires us to compare the dimming effect caused by starspots due to stellar rotation with the dimming effect caused by an exoplanet transit. We need to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl/R_star) that produces a transit depth equal to the amplitude of the rotational modulation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Model the Flux from the Star**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star, or a part of it, can be approximated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T).\nFlux (F) ∝ Area (A) × T⁴\n\nThe star has two hemispheres: one is pristine (unspotted), and the other is 20% covered by spots. As the star rotates, an observer sees these two faces, leading to a variation in the measured brightness.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature T_star. Let the projected area of the star be A_disk = πR_star².\n    F_max ∝ A_disk × T_star⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere with spots faces the observer. We assume the filling factor `f = 0.20` (or 20%) applies to the projected disk area. This means 20% of the visible disk is at the spot temperature (T_spot) and 80% is at the star's effective temperature (T_star).\n    The flux from this composite surface is the sum of the fluxes from the unspotted and spotted parts.\n    F_min ∝ [ (1-f) × A_disk × T_star⁴ ] + [ f × A_disk × T_spot⁴ ]\n    F_min ∝ A_disk × [ (1-f)T_star⁴ + fT_spot⁴ ]\n\n**2. Calculate the Amplitude of the Rotational Modulation**\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum states.\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for F_max and F_min:\nAmplitude = ( A_disk T_star⁴ - A_disk [ (1-f)T_star⁴ + fT_spot⁴ ] ) / ( A_disk T_star⁴ )\n\nWe can cancel out the common A_disk term:\nAmplitude = ( T_star⁴ - (1-f)T_star⁴ - fT_spot⁴ ) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = ( T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + fT_star⁴ - fT_spot⁴ ) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = ( fT_star⁴ - fT_spot⁴ ) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = f × ( T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴ ) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = f × [ 1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_star = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature difference = 1000 K, so T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 × [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 0.20 × [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\n**3. Model the Exoplanet Transit Depth**\n\nAn exoplanet passing in front of its star causes a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nTransit Depth = (πR_pl²) / (πR_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the exoplanet transit must produce the same amplitude signal as the rotational modulation.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 × [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\n\nNow we can solve for the ratio R_pl / R_star by taking the square root.\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_star = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the rotational modulation signal\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)\ntemp_ratio_to_fourth_power = (T_spot / T_star)**4\namplitude = f * (1 - temp_ratio_to_fourth_power)\n\n# The transit depth is equal to this amplitude: (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n# So, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nRpl_Rstar_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_Rstar_ratio)\n\n```\n(result)\n0.3217912253594875\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (R_pl/R_star) is approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
