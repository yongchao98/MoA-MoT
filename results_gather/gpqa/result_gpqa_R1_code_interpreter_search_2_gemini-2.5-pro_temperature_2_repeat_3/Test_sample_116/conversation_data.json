    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as restricted rotation in certain molecules (atropisomerism). A key test for chirality is the absence of any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\n*   **Analysis of Each Compound**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is a biphenyl, meaning it has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are located at the positions ortho to this connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, there are methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n        *   **Chirality:** The substituents at the ortho positions are bulky. This steric hindrance prevents the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The rings are therefore forced to be non-coplanar, adopting a twisted conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which can lead to axial chirality.\n        *   **Symmetry:** To be chiral, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its stable, twisted conformation, this molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The two stable, twisted conformations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (also known as methyl lactate):\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3`.\n        *   **Chirality:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   **Symmetry:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound has a chiral center and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (exists as a pair of enantiomers, R and S).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**:\n        *   **Structure:** The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C6H5).\n        *   **Chirality:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O group and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral. While the phenyl rings can twist to create fleeting chiral \"propeller\" conformations, they can interconvert rapidly at room temperature through achiral conformations. Therefore, benzophenone is considered achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is `CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3`, with a *trans* geometry about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar (or nearly planar).\n        *   **Symmetry:** Due to the *trans* arrangement of identical groups across the double bond, the molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you trace a line from any atom through this center and an equal distance beyond, you will find an identical atom. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are optically active. Compounds 3 (benzophenone) and 4 (dimethyl fumarate) are not.\n    Therefore, the correct option is the one that includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
