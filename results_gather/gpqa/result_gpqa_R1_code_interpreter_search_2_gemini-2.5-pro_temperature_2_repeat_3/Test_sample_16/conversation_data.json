    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Chemical Reaction and Equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is an equilibrium reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe problem starts with a solution of the complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻, which will partially dissociate back into its constituent ions. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**2. Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the formation reaction is given as the formation constant, K_f (also denoted as K_stability or KCa-EDTA).\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\nGiven: K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**3. Setting up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Substituting into the Equilibrium Expression**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**5. Simplification and Calculation**\n\nBecause the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰ >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n\nWe can make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (initial_complex_conc - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so we can approximate (initial_complex_conc - x) ≈ initial_complex_conc.\n# K_f ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# x^2 ≈ initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\nThe concentration of Ca2+ ions is: 6.32e-07 M\n<<<\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry**: The problem involves a chemical equilibrium. We have a solution of the Calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as [Ca-EDTA]²⁻. This complex is stable but will dissociate slightly into its constituent ions, free Calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (which we can represent as EDTA⁴⁻, assuming ideal pH where it's fully deprotonated).\n\n2.  **Write the Chemical Equation**: The dissociation of the complex is the reverse of its formation.\n    *   Formation reaction: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n    *   Dissociation reaction (what's happening in our solution): [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant**: We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the formation reaction.\n    *   K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\n    *   Given K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression**: Now we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    *   5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    *   5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Simplify and Solve**: The formation constant K_f is extremely large (50 billion). This tells us that the equilibrium lies very far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and very little of it dissociates. Therefore, 'x' will be incredibly small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make a simplifying assumption:\n    *   Assume (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation now becomes much easier to solve:\n    *   5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   Rearrange to solve for x²: x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root of both sides: x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    *   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷\n\n7.  **Final Answer**: The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    Comparing this result to the options provided:\n    *   A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    *   B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   D) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated concentration matches option B. The python code confirmed this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<B>>>"
