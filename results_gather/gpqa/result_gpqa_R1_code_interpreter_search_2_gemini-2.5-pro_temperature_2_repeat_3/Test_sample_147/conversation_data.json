    "Here is a thinking process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial data and constraints.**\n    *   We are looking for an element `Y`.\n    *   There are five distinct binary fluorides of `Y`: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5.\n    *   A1: Bright-red, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (F₂). It oxidizes xenon.\n    *   A2: Contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ɷF = 0.3196).\n    *   A3: Obtained by fluorinating `Y`, also interacts with xenon.\n    *   A4: Forms a hot, colorless, concentrated solution.\n    *   A5: Obtained by reacting `Y` with A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n2.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    *   Let the formula of A2 be YFₓ. The molar mass of Y is M(Y) and fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is given by: ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F)).\n    *   Rearranging for M(Y): M(Y) = (x * M(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF.\n    *   Substituting the values: M(Y) = (x * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196 ≈ x * 40.45.\n    *   Now, we test integer values for `x` (the oxidation state) and see if M(Y) matches any known element.\n\n    ```python\n    import pandas as pd\n    \n    # Pre-defined periodic table data for common elements.\n    elements_data = {\n        'Symbol': ['Ca', 'Br', 'Sb', 'I', 'Hg', 'Bi', 'Pu', 'Te', 'Cr'],\n        'Mass': [40.078, 79.904, 121.76, 126.90, 200.59, 208.98, 244, 127.60, 51.996]\n    }\n    elements = pd.DataFrame(elements_data).set_index('Symbol')\n    \n    w_F = 0.3196\n    M_F = 18.9984\n    ratio = M_F * (1 - w_F) / w_F\n    \n    results = []\n    for x in range(1, 7):\n        m_y_calc = x * ratio\n        # Find the element with the closest mass\n        best_fit_symbol = (elements['Mass'] - m_y_calc).abs().idxmin()\n        best_fit_mass = elements.loc[best_fit_symbol, 'Mass']\n        diff = abs(best_fit_mass - m_y_calc)\n        percent_diff = (diff / best_fit_mass) * 100\n        results.append([x, m_y_calc, best_fit_symbol, best_fit_mass, percent_diff])\n        \n    df_results = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=['x', 'Calculated M(Y)', 'Best Fit', 'Element Mass', '% Difference'])\n    print(df_results.to_string())\n    \n    # Also calculate the theoretical %F for the best fits\n    # %F for SbF3\n    w_f_sbf3 = (3 * M_F) / (elements.loc['Sb', 'Mass'] + 3 * M_F)\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated %F for SbF3: {w_f_sbf3*100:.2f}%\")\n    \n    # %F for IF3\n    w_f_if3 = (3 * M_F) / (elements.loc['I', 'Mass'] + 3 * M_F)\n    print(f\"Calculated %F for IF3: {w_f_if3*100:.2f}%\")\n\n    ```\n    The output from the code shows the following:\n    ```\n       x  Calculated M(Y) Best Fit  Element Mass  % Difference\n    0  1        40.448375       Ca        40.078      0.924169\n    1  2        80.896750       Br        79.904      1.242426\n    2  3       121.345125       Sb       121.760      0.340763\n    3  4       161.793500       Te       127.600     26.797414\n    4  5       202.241875       Hg       200.590      0.823491\n    5  6       242.690250       Pu       244.000      0.536783\n\n    Calculated %F for SbF3: 31.89%\n    Calculated %F for IF3: 30.99%\n    ```\n\n3.  **Evaluate the candidates.**\n    *   The best match is for `x=3`, which gives M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb), with M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol (a difference of only 0.34%).\n    *   Calculating the theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF₃ gives 31.89%, which is nearly identical to the problem's value of 31.96%.\n    *   Other candidates like Bromine (Y=Br, A2=BrF₂) or Iodine (Y=I, A2=IF₃) show a larger discrepancy in the mass percentage.\n    *   Therefore, it's highly probable that **Y = Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n4.  **Identify the other compounds, especially A4.**\n    *   The problem describes A4 as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This implies A4 is a colorless substance that can be dissolved.\n    *   The known binary fluorides of antimony are primarily SbF₃ (a white/colorless solid) and SbF₅ (a colorless liquid).\n    *   For the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` to occur, A4 must be in a higher oxidation state than A5. Adding elemental Sb (oxidation state 0) should cause a reduction.\n    *   A reaction like `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5` is unlikely.\n    *   Therefore, A4 must be the higher fluoride, **A4 = SbF₅**. It is a colorless substance and a powerful oxidizer, fitting the description.\n\n5.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the range.**\n    *   Substance A4 is SbF₅.\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of SbF₅ = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n    *   MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 95.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Compare the calculated molecular weight with the given options.**\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 140-160\n    *   D) 160-180\n    *   Our calculated value is 216.76 g/mol. This value is very close to range B (220-240). The small discrepancy (3.24 g/mol) is likely due to rounding in the problem's ranges or slight variations in atomic mass values used. None of the other ranges are plausible.\n\n7.  **Final consistency check (addressing contradictions).**\n    *   Although the mass percentage points strongly to Sb, other clues seem contradictory (the \"bright-red\" color for A1 vs. colorless SbF₅; the decomposition temperature; the 1:1 reaction; having five distinct compounds). Chemical problems of this nature, especially from competitions, sometimes contain inaccuracies or \"red herrings\" in descriptive properties. The quantitative data (mass percentage) is the most reliable clue. The logic flow from `ɷF -> Y=Sb -> A2=SbF₃ -> A4=SbF₅ -> MW(A4) ≈ 217` is the most robust. Given the choices, B is the only credible option for a molecular weight of ~217 g/mol. The possibility of Y=Iodine leads to a perfect MW match for A4=IF₅ (221.9 g/mol), but a poor fit for the mass percentage of A2. Trusting the highly specific mass percentage is the better strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
