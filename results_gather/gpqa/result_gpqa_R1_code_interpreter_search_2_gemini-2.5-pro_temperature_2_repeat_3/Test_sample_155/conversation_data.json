    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Step 1.1: Starting Material and Epoxidation**\n    *   The starting material is **(E)-oct-4-ene**, which is a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   It is treated with mCPBA, a peroxyacid. The epoxidation reaction with a peroxyacid is a **stereospecific syn-addition** of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   Syn-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral, but the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the alkene plane with equal probability.\n    *   This non-stereoselective attack on the two faces produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: **(4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane** and **(4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane**. This mixture is called a racemic mixture.\n\n*   **Step 1.2: Acid-Catalyzed Epoxide Opening**\n    *   The racemic mixture of epoxides is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This causes the epoxide ring to open, forming a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups).\n    *   The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is a **stereospecific anti-addition** of water. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (a backside attack), causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   Let's consider the opening of one of the enantiomers, for example, **(4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane**:\n        *   If water attacks at C4 (which is R), the stereocenter at C4 inverts to S, while C5 remains R. The product is **(4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   If water attacks at C5 (which is R), the stereocenter at C5 inverts to S, while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   Now, we must check the relationship between these two products. A molecule with the configuration (4R,5S) and another with (4S,5R), where the substituents on C4 and C5 are identical (H, OH, propyl group), are actually the same achiral compound. This is because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion) and is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   Opening the other enantiomer, **(4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane**, will also yield the same **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Step 2.1: Starting Material and Epoxidation**\n    *   The starting material is **(Z)-oct-4-ene**, which is a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   Again, this undergoes a **stereospecific syn-addition** with mCPBA.\n    *   Syn-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Attack by mCPBA from the top or bottom face leads to the same, single product. This product, the *cis*-epoxide, also has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a **meso compound** (specifically, **meso-4,5-epoxyoctane**).\n\n*   **Step 2.2: Acid-Catalyzed Epoxide Opening**\n    *   The meso-epoxide is then opened by **anti-addition** of water in the presence of acid.\n    *   Let's consider the opening of the meso-epoxide (which has, for example, a (4R,5S) configuration):\n        *   If water attacks at C4 (which is R), the stereocenter at C4 inverts to S. The stereocenter at C5 is unchanged (S). The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   If water attacks at C5 (which is S), the stereocenter at C5 inverts to R. The stereocenter at C4 is unchanged (R). The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**, are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, a 1:1 mixture of these two enantiomers is formed. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture by HPLC**\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Identify the components of the final mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Understand the relationships between the isomers**\n    *   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n    *   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Predict the chromatogram on a standard (achiral) HPLC column**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus have different retention times. They will be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and will have the same retention time. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral column will show:\n        *   One peak for the meso-diol.\n        *   One peak for the co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,S)-diols.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Predict the chromatogram on a chiral HPLC column**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   A chiral column can separate all different stereoisomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral column will resolve all three compounds in the mixture:\n        *   One peak for the meso-diol.\n        *   One peak for the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   One peak for the (4S,S)-diol.\n    *   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC column and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC column.\n\nThis corresponds to option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
