    "The user wants to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    The cobalt-containing species are the free cobalt ion, `Co²⁺`, and the various thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the thiocyanate ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (β).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Substitute these expressions into the total concentration equation:**\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + (β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) + (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Factor out the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`:**\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:**\n    The percentage we want to find is `([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100%`.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:** In a solution containing Co(II) and SCN⁻ ions, a series of complexation reactions occur, leading to the formation of different species. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The concentration of each complex can be related to the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (`βn`).\n    *   `[Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Note: The problem assumes that the initial thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M is equal to the equilibrium free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`. This is a reasonable assumption because the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is much smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), so the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is negligible.\n\n3.  **Express the total concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Determine the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex:** The question asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex relative to the total cobalt species. This is the mole fraction (α₂) of that species, multiplied by 100.\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100 = ([Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)) * 100`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    **Numerator:**\n    `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    **Denominator:**\n    *   `1 = 1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    **Fraction:**\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    `Percentage ≈ 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
