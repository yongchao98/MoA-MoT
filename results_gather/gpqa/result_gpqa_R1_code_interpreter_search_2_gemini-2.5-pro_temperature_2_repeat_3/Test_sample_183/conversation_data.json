    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 (vicinal or adjacent substitution).\n*   C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n*   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relationships between the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider the directing effects of the substituents and any intermediates during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing. It is very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. It gets protonated to -NH3+ in strong acid, which is deactivating and meta-directing.\n*   **-NHCOCH3 (acetamido)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing (used to protect amines).\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Can be used as a blocking group as it's removable.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nA \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step has high regioselectivity, with each new substituent being directed to the correct position by the groups already on the ring. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option A**: The list of reactions appears disordered and contains illogical steps. For example, it shows diazotization (iv: NaNO2/HCl) which requires an amine, but the reduction to form an amine (viii: Fe/HCl) appears much later in the sequence. It also lists nitration twice. This sequence is not chemically coherent.\n\n*   **Option C**: Step (vi) suggests nitrating a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and generally not subjected to further EAS like nitration. They are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis). This step makes the sequence invalid.\n\n*   **Option D**: Similar to option C, step (vi) suggests sulfonating a diazonium salt. This is also not a standard or logical transformation. The sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B**: This sequence presents a series of chemically valid transformations in a logical order. Let's trace the expected products based on standard EAS rules.\n\n    **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    \n    **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product will be **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. (tBu at C1, NO2 at C4).\n    \n    **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group gives **p-tert-butylaniline**. (tBu at C1, NH2 at C4).\n    \n    **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the -NH2 group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a deactivating, meta-director. The -tBu group at C1 is an o,p-director.\n    *   The -tBu group (at C1) directs to positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The -NH3+ group (at C4) directs to positions C2 and C6.\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: ortho to the t-butyl group and meta to the anilinium group.\n    *   This results in **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   The resulting molecule has substituents at positions 1 (NH2), 2 (NO2), and 4 (tBu). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**. The target molecule has a **1,2,3-pattern**.\n\n    At this point, it is clear that under standard reaction conditions, this sequence produces the wrong isomer. However, options A, C, and D contain fundamentally illogical steps. Option B is the only sequence where each individual reaction is a valid chemical process, even if the overall pathway leads to an incorrect isomer based on a standard analysis. It is the most plausible sequence presented. There may be an unstated condition or a more complex rearrangement mechanism implied, or the problem itself might be flawed. Given the choices, B represents the most synthetically coherent, albeit regiochemically problematic, pathway. The final steps (viii and ix), which add and then remove a sulfonic acid group, are unusual but could theoretically be part of a more complex process like an isomeric purification or a (less likely) rearrangement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, A, C, and D contain steps that are synthetically nonsensical in the order they are presented. Option B outlines a series of individually plausible chemical reactions, even though a straightforward analysis of the regiochemistry leads to an incorrect isomer. Therefore, among the given choices, B is the only one that represents a coherent, albeit flawed, synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
