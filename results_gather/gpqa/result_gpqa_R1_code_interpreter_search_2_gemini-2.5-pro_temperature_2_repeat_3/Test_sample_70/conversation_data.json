    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star = Star's temperature\n    *   R_star = Star's radius\n    *   A = Planet's albedo\n    *   a = Planet's semi-major axis\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2. This means the (1 - A)^(1/4) term also cancels out.\n    *   The constant '2' in the square root also cancels.\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³\n    or\n    a³ ∝ P²  => a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the relationship between 'a' and 'P' into the simplified temperature ratio:\n    a₂ / a₄ = (P₂)^(2/3) / (P₄)^(2/3) = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n    \n    Substitute this back into the T_eq4 / T_eq2 equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is:\n    P₁ : P₂ : P₃ : P₄ : P₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    From this, we can find the ratio P₂ / P₄:\n    P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, plug the period ratio into the final equation and calculate the result.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T4/T2) is related to the ratio of orbital periods (P2/P4) by the formula: T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).\n# The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n# We need the ratio of P2 to P4.\n\n# Get the period ratio values from the problem statement.\nP2_val = 2\nP4_val = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio P2/P4.\nperiod_ratio_P2_over_P4 = P2_val / P4_val\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio by taking the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_P2_over_P4**(1/3)\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The calculation shows the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.8298. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n<<<C>>>"
