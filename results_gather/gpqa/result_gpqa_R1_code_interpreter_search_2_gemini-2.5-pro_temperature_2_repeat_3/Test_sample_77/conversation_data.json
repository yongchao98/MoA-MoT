    "This question asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The problem is a standard one in classical electromagnetism, and its solution is a well-established result.\n\n### 1. Identify the physical situation and definitions\n*   **Source:** A point charge q.\n*   **Source's motion:** Trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n*   **Observer's position (field point):** $\\vec{r}$.\n*   **Observation time:** t.\n*   **Retarded time ($t_r$):** The time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at time t. The time difference $(t - t_r)$ is the time it takes light to travel the distance from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position.\n*   **Source's position at retarded time:** $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Source's velocity at retarded time:** $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n*   **Vector from retarded source position to observer:** $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   **Distance from retarded source position to observer:** $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   **Condition for retarded time:** The time taken for light to travel the distance d is $d/c$. Thus, $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n### 2. The Retarded Potentials\nThe general formulas for potentials from a charge distribution $\\rho$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} d^3\\vec{r'}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r')}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|} d^3\\vec{r'}$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r'}|/c$.\n\n### 3. Specializing to a Point Charge\nFor a point charge q, the charge density is $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$ and the current density is $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them is a standard but non-trivial derivation. The crucial point is that the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function also depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. The result of this integration is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe derivation accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge appears contracted due to the finite speed of signal propagation (a Doppler-like effect). The integration results in:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s})}{c|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{\\text{retarded time}}$\n\n### 4. Applying the Given Notation\nUsing the notation provided in the problem statement:\n*   $[\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}]_{\\text{retarded time}} = \\vec{d}$\n*   $[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|]_{\\text{retarded time}} = d$\n*   $[\\vec{v}]_{\\text{retarded time}} = \\vec{v}$\n\nThe potentials become:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n### 5. Matching with the Options\nThe given options have the term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator. Let's rewrite our expressions by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nNow we compare these final expressions with the options:\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}}$\n    This matches our derived expressions perfectly.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}}$\n    The sign in the denominator is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)}$\n    This uses the static potential form and does not account for retardation or the velocity term in the denominator of V.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)}$\n    This also uses the incorrect static form for V. Although the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for the true Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
