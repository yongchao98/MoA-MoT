    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the given operators**\n\nThe components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ are given in terms of 2x2 matrices. Let's write them down.\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese matrices are the well-known Pauli spin matrices, denoted by $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$. So, the operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$: $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n**2. Define the direction vector** $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general direction vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi = 0$. This holds if $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$ (or if $\\theta=0$ or $\\pi$, which are special cases along the z-axis). Let's take the standard choice of $\\phi=0$, which covers the positive x-region of the plane.\nSo, the unit direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Construct the operator along the direction** $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$.\n$P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{n}$ and the operators:\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n$P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\nWe can factor out the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\nCombining the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nThe eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\nLet the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the operator and eigenvalue:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, where C is a normalization constant. A convenient choice for the unnormalized vector is to set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, which gives $b = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSo, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi'\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**5. Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nThe normalization condition requires the inner product of the state with itself to be 1: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\nFor our vector $|\\psi'\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, the squared norm is:\n$|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\nThe vector is already normalized.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with the given options**\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. Dimensionally wrong (contains $\\hbar$) and not a function of $\\theta$.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$.\n*   C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$: **This matches our result perfectly.**\n*   D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect. Dimensionally wrong and contains incorrect constant factors.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
