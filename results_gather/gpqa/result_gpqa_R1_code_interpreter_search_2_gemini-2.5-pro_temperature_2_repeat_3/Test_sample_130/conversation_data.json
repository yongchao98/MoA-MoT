    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1: The Anhydride.** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is provided:\n        *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak indicates all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. A chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This indicates there are only two types of carbon atoms. The peak at ~137 ppm is in the alkene carbon range, and the peak at ~165 ppm is in the anhydride carbonyl carbon range.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride is formed by dehydrating maleic acid (a cis-dicarboxylic acid). It has a plane of symmetry that makes its two vinylic protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent, consistent with the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Reactant 2: The Diene.** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds. The carbons involved in the conjugation (C1, C2, C3, C4) each have a methyl group. The remaining carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). This is a classic **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** reaction. This [4+2] cycloaddition will form a bicyclic product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can form two major diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that for kinetically controlled reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented towards the newly forming pi system of the diene.\n    *   However, the endo rule is overridden when there is significant steric hindrance. In this specific diene, there are methyl groups at the bridgehead-forming carbons (C1 and C4). These methyl groups create substantial steric clash with the approaching anhydride in the *endo* transition state.\n    *   Because of this severe steric hindrance, the reaction strongly favors the alternative **exo** approach. Experimental studies on this specific reaction confirm that the **exo product is the major product** (exo/endo ratio > 100:1), and the *endo* product is the minor one.\n        *   **Major Product = Exo Isomer**\n        *   **Minor Product = Endo Isomer**\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals means the corresponding protons are spatially close.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** (the exo isomer) but **absent in the minor product** (the endo isomer). We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the exo structure but far apart in the endo structure.\n\n5.  **Let's sketch the isomers and identify the key protons:**\n    *   **Proton types in the product:**\n        *   **H_alkane (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** These are the two equivalent protons on the carbons from the original maleic anhydride double bond. In the product, they are on the succinic anhydride ring fragment.\n        *   **Me_vinyl (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond of the product.\n        *   **Me_bh (6H singlet, ~1 ppm):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   **C7-H (bridge protons, e.g., a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm):** These are the two protons on the CH₂ bridge of the bicyclic system. They are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* relative to the double bond) and couple to each other.\n\n    *   **Spatial analysis of the Exo Isomer (Major Product):**\n        *   In the exo isomer, the anhydride part is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-CH₂ bridge.\n        *   This brings the **H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm)** very close to the **C7-H protons (~1.5 ppm)**. A NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n        *   The H_alkane protons are far from the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n    *   **Spatial analysis of the Endo Isomer (Minor Product):**\n        *   In the endo isomer, the anhydride part is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-CH₂ bridge, tucked underneath the double bond.\n        *   This brings the **H_alkane protons (~3.5 ppm)** very close to the **Me_vinyl protons (~1.7 ppm)**.\n        *   The H_alkane protons are far from the C7-H protons. A NOESY cross-peak is NOT expected.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (exo) isomer but absent in the minor (endo) isomer must be between the **H_alkane protons** and the **C7-H protons**.\n    *   Looking at the options, this corresponds to the pair described in B:\n        *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (a C7-H proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (the H_alkane protons)**.\n\n    *   Let's check the other options to be sure:\n        *   A) Me_vinyl and H_alkane: Close in the minor (endo) product, not the major.\n        *   C) Me_bh and C7-H: These are close in both isomers.\n        *   D) Me_bh and Me_vinyl: These are on adjacent carbons and are close in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the experimental observation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
