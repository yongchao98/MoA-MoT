    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them and does not help us distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThis is the key to differentiating between the possible structures. We are given the following information:\n*   There are no signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (ruling out C=C double bonds, which is true for all options).\n*   The spectrum contains a proton signal with the multiplicity of a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The spectrum contains a *different* proton signal with the multiplicity of a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe task is to find which of the given structures would produce both of these complex splitting patterns. We will use the *n+1* rule for splitting. A complex multiplet like `dtt` means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n*   A **doublet (d)** means coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   A **triplet (t)** means coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   A **quartet (q)** means coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq**: The proton is coupled to one proton (`d`), a set of two protons (`t`), and a set of three protons (`q`).\n*   **dtt**: The proton is coupled to one proton (`d`), a set of two protons (`t`), and another different set of two protons (`t`).\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the chiral carbons (the methine protons, -CH-) as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\nStructure: `CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(d)(CH₃(e))-COOH`\n*   **H(d) on C2:** Coupled to H(c) (1 proton, d) and the protons of CH₃(e) (3 protons, q). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **H(c) on C3:** Coupled to H(d) (1 proton, d), the protons of CH₂(b) (2 protons, t), and the protons of CH₃(f) (3 protons, q). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\nStructure: `(CH₃)₂CH(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(e))-CH₂(f)-COOH`\n*   **H(d) on C4:** Coupled to H(c) (1 proton, d) and the 6 protons of the two methyl groups attached to C4 (septet). This signal would be a **doublet of septets**.\n*   **H(c) on C3:** Coupled to H(d) (1 proton, d), the protons of CH₂(f) (2 protons, t), and the protons of CH₃(e) (3 protons, q). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\nStructure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H(d) on C2:** Coupled to H(c) (1 proton, d) and the CH₂ protons of its ethyl group (2 protons, t). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **H(c) on C3:** Coupled to H(d) (1 proton, d), the CH₂ protons of the terminal ethyl group (2 protons, t), and the CH₂ protons of its own ethyl group (2 protons, t). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula is best interpreted as a linear chain of carbon-containing groups. Let's draw the structure this implies and determine its IUPAC name:\n`CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`\nThe longest carbon chain containing the COOH group is the one drawn linearly, which has 5 carbons. The substituents are two ethyl groups, one at position 3 and one at position 4 (numbering from the COOH carbon as C1).\nThe structure is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n      `CH₂CH₃`   `CH₂CH₃`\n          |         |\n`CH₃(i) - CH(x) --- CH(y) --- CH₂(f) --- COOH`\n   C5       C4         C3          C2          C1\n\nLet's analyze the key protons H(x) and H(y):\n*   **H(x) on C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  H(y) on C3 (1 proton) → doublet (d)\n    2.  The protons on the C4-ethyl group's CH₂ (2 protons) → triplet (t)\n    3.  The protons on the terminal CH₃ group (C5) (3 protons) → quartet (q)\n    The resulting signal for H(x) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of NMR data.\n*   **H(y) on C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  H(x) on C4 (1 proton) → doublet (d)\n    2.  The protons on the CH₂ group at C2 (2 protons) → triplet (t)\n    3.  The protons on the C3-ethyl group's CH₂ (2 protons) → triplet (t)\n    The resulting signal for H(y) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second piece of NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which corresponds to the formula given in option B, is the only one that exhibits both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
