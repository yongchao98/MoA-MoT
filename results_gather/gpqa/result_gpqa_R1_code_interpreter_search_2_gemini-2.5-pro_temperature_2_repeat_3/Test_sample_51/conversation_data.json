    "Here's the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem asks for the ratio of populations of two energy levels in an atom. Assuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of these levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n    `N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n    where `N` is the number of atoms in a given energy state, `g` is the statistical weight of that state, `E` is the energy of the state, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Ratios:** Let `R` be the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) to the lower energy level (level 1), so `R = N_2 / N_1`.\n    *   For the star without spots: `R_nospot = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))`\n    *   For the star with spots: `R_withspot = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n    where `ΔE = E_2 - E_1`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Target Quantity:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is `Factor = R_nospot / R_withspot`.\n    `Factor = [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)) ]`\n    The statistical weights `g_2` and `g_1` cancel out:\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a-b)`:\n    `Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)) ]`\n    `Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_withspot - 1 / T_nospot) ]`\n\n4.  **Identify the Relevant Temperatures:** The problem gives the effective temperature (`Teff`) for both scenarios. A common and reasonable simplification in such problems is to use the effective temperature as the characteristic temperature of the photosphere where the spectral lines are formed.\n    *   `T_nospot = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_withspot = 5500 K`\n    The other information (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is consistent with the temperature drop but not directly needed for the calculation under this simplifying assumption.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (`ΔE`):** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. We can relate them using the Planck-Einstein relation `ΔE = hc/λ`. The term needed for the exponent is `ΔE/k`.\n    `ΔE / k = hc / (λk)`\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** We have all the pieces to calculate the factor. This can be done efficiently and accurately using a script.\n\n    *   Constants: `h` (Planck's constant), `c` (speed of light), `k` (Boltzmann's constant).\n    *   Inputs: `λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 * 10⁻⁷ m`, `T_nospot = 6000 K`, `T_withspot = 5500 K`.\n    *   Step 1: Calculate `ΔE/k`.\n    *   Step 2: Calculate `(1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot)`.\n    *   Step 3: Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to get the exponent.\n    *   Step 4: Calculate the exponential of that result to find the final factor.\n\nThe calculation is performed in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23    # Boltzmann's constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters\nwavelength_A = 1448  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_nospot = 6000      # Temperature without spots in K\nT_withspot = 5500    # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Convert wavelength to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference term Delta_E / k\n# Delta_E = h * c / wavelength\n# So, Delta_E / k = (h * c) / (wavelength * k)\ndelta_E_over_k = (h * c) / (wavelength_m * k)\n\n# Calculate the term in the exponent of the final ratio\nexponent = delta_E_over_k * (1/T_withspot - 1/T_nospot)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n4.506306560370605\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.506, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels changes as the star's temperature changes. The population of these energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation, assuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states, `N₂` (higher energy) and `N₁` (lower energy), is given by:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N₂`, `N₁` are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n    *   `g₂`, `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Define the Ratio and Factor**: The problem states that the ratio of populations decreases when spots are present (i.e., when the temperature is lower). This implies the ratio under consideration is `R = N₂ / N₁`, as the exponential term `exp(-ΔE / (k * T))` decreases when `T` decreases.\n\n    We need to find the factor by which this ratio `R` changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This factor is `F = R_nospot / R_withspot`.\n\n    *   For the star without spots: `R_nospot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))`\n    *   For the star with spots: `R_withspot = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n\n    The factor `F` is the division of these two expressions:\n    `F = R_nospot / R_withspot = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)) ]`\n\n    The statistical weights `g₂ / g₁` cancel out:\n    `F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_withspot))`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n    `F = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)) ]`\n    `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_withspot - 1 / T_nospot) ]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (`ΔE`)**: The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy is given by `ΔE = hc/λ`. The term we need for our factor `F` is `ΔE / k`.\n\n    `ΔE / k = hc / (λk)`\n\n4.  **Identify Temperatures**: The problem gives the relevant temperatures:\n    *   `T_nospot = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_withspot = 5500 K`\n    The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of surface covered by spots explains *why* the effective temperature drops, but these values are not needed for this specific calculation. We use the effective temperature as the characteristic temperature of the photosphere.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We have all the necessary components to calculate the factor `F`. The calculation was performed by the provided python script, which implements the final formula:\n\n    `F = exp[ (hc / (λk)) * (1 / T_withspot - 1 / T_nospot) ]`\n\nThe script's execution yields a result of `4.5064...`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~1.1\n*   B) ~4.5\n*   C) ~7.8\n*   D) ~2.9\n\nThe calculated factor of approximately 4.5 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
