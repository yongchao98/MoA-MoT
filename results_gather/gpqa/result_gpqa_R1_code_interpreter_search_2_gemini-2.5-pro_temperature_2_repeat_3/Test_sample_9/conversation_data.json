    "This question requires understanding the relationship between a rocky planet's mass and its density.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Options:** We are given four scenarios for exoplanets and asked to determine which one would have the highest density.\n\n2.  **Establish a Baseline (Option a):**\n    *   \"An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet\" is essentially Earth itself.\n    *   Earth's average density is a standard reference point, approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option b:**\n    *   \"A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³\".\n    *   The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is almost identical to Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Analyze Options c and d (The Key Concept):**\n    *   These options describe planets with the *same composition* as Earth but different masses (5 times more massive and half the mass, respectively).\n    *   The key physical principle here is **gravitational self-compression**. When you add more mass to a rocky planet (keeping the composition the same), the force of its own gravity increases. This increased gravity compresses the planet's interior materials (the iron core and silicate mantle) more tightly.\n    *   **Greater Mass → Stronger Gravity → More Compression → Higher Density.**\n    *   Conversely, a less massive planet has weaker gravity and experiences less compression, resulting in a lower average density.\n\n5.  **Apply the Concept:**\n    *   **Option c:** A planet with 5 times Earth's mass and the same composition will be significantly more compressed by its own gravity than Earth is. Therefore, its density will be *higher* than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n    *   **Option d:** A planet with half of Earth's mass and the same composition will be less compressed by its own gravity. Therefore, its density will be *lower* than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n6.  **Compare all options:**\n    *   a) Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   b) Density ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   c) Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high mass and compression)\n    *   d) Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low mass and less compression)\n\n**Conclusion:** The planet described in option (c) will have the highest density because its large mass causes the greatest amount of gravitational self-compression.\n\nTo provide a numerical estimate, we can use a simple physics-based model. The density (ρ) of a rocky planet scales with its mass (M) roughly as ρ ∝ M^β, where β is a positive number (typically around 0.15-0.20 for rocky planets). This mathematical relationship confirms that as mass increases, density increases. For M = 5 M_Earth, the density would be substantially higher than for M = 1 M_Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
