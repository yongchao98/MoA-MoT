    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that is purely radial and its magnitude is `1/r^2`. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The objective is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (`∇.f`) over a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin. The integral is:\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV`\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this kind of problem. It relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field over the boundary of the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n    where:\n    *   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `S` is the closed surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `dS` is the differential surface area vector, which points normally outward from the surface. For a sphere, `dS = r̂ * dS`, and at the surface `r=R`, so `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    Now we need to calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, the flux of the field `f` through the spherical surface `S`.\n    *   **The field `f` on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, `r = R`. So, the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **The dot product `f . dS`:**\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ]`\n        Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n        `f . dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   **The integral `∮_S (f . dS)`:** We integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the spherical angles are `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   **Solve the integral:**\n        We can separate the integrals:\n        `∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ * ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ`\n        The first integral is:\n        `[φ] (from 0 to 2π) = 2π`\n        The second integral is:\n        `[-cos(θ)] (from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n        Multiplying the results:\n        `∮_S (f . dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Important Note on the Singularity:** If one were to calculate the divergence of `f = r̂/r^2` directly, the result would be `∇.f = 0` for any `r ≠ 0`. This might misleadingly suggest the integral is zero. However, the vector field is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and its divergence is described by the Dirac delta function, `∇ . (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. The integral of this delta function over any volume containing the origin is `4π`, which confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem. The theorem correctly handles this singularity at the origin.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 0\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
