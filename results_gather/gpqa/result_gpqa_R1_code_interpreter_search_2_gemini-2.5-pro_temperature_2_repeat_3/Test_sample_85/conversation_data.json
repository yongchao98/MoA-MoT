    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure\nThe product in both reactions is **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is a six-membered saturated lactone (cyclic ester). The structure is as follows, with IUPAC numbering:\n\n```\n      O=C(2)\n      /   \\\n  H2C(3)   O(1)\n   |       |\nEt-CH(4)  CH2(6)\n    \\   /\n    H2C(5)\n```\n\nThe molecule has a single chiral center at carbon C4, which is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon atoms within the ring (C3 and C5). The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this product.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents\nThe options for starting materials (A and B) are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's deduce the structure from this name. It's a pentanoic acid derivative with an ethyl group at C3 and an ester group at C5. This compound is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid.\n\nStructure of the Starting Material:\n```\n                                O\n                               //\n      HOOC(1) - CH2(2) - CH(3) - CH2(4) - C(5) - O-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n                           |\n                           CH2CH3 (Ethyl group)\n```\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n2.  An isobutyl ester (-COOiBu) at C5.\n\nIt also has a chiral center at C3, which will become the C4 chiral center in the lactone product.\n\nThe two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It does *not* reduce carboxylic acids under normal conditions. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the ester group at C5.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** This reagent is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids. It also reduces aldehydes and ketones but reduces esters more slowly. In a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester, BH3 will preferentially reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Reaction A\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is unchanged.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is a hydroxy-acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    3.  Under acidic workup (H+), the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon, leading to intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and lactonization) do not involve making or breaking any bonds at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the absolute 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved. However, the *R/S descriptor* might change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking (according to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) of the substituents attached to the chiral center.\n\nLet's analyze the CIP priorities:\n*   **Priorities on C3 of Starting Material (A):**\n    The substituents are -H, -CH2CH3, -CH2COOH, and -CH2COOiBu.\n    1.  `-CH2COOiBu` (The branch towards the ester. Priority is higher than the acid because the oxygen is connected to a carbon (isobutyl) instead of a hydrogen).\n    2.  `-CH2COOH` (The branch towards the acid).\n    3.  `-CH2CH3` (Ethyl group).\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Priorities on C4 of the Lactone Product:**\n    The substituents are -H, -CH2CH3, the ring segment towards the carbonyl (`-CH2-C=O`), and the ring segment towards the ether oxygen (`-CH2-CH2-O-`).\n    1.  `-CH2-C(=O)-` (Path towards the carbonyl has higher priority because C2 is bonded to two oxygens).\n    2.  `-CH2-CH2-O-` (Path towards the ether oxygen).\n    3.  `-CH2CH3` (Ethyl group).\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **Mapping Priorities from Reactant to Product in Reaction A:**\n    *   The starting substituent `-CH2COOiBu` (Priority 1) is reduced to `-CH2CH2OH`, which forms the ether side of the lactone (`-CH2-CH2-O-`), corresponding to **Priority 2** in the product.\n    *   The starting substituent `-CH2COOH` (Priority 2) remains and forms the carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH2-C=O`), corresponding to **Priority 1** in the product.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped**. This means that if the starting material has an (S) configuration, the product will have an (R) configuration, and vice versa. The R/S descriptor is **inverted**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction A:** Since the product is **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration. So, **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Reaction B\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is unaffected.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is a hydroxy-ester: `(iBuO)OC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    3.  Upon workup, the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, leading to intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the 3D arrangement at the chiral center is preserved. We must check the CIP priorities.\n*   **Mapping Priorities from Reactant to Product in Reaction B:**\n    *   The starting substituent `-CH2COOiBu` (Priority 1) is not reduced and forms the carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH2-C=O`), corresponding to **Priority 1** in the product.\n    *   The starting substituent `-CH2COOH` (Priority 2) is reduced to `-CH2CH2OH`, which forms the ether side of the lactone (`-CH2-CH2-O-`), corresponding to **Priority 2** in the product.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups are **maintained** (1->1, 2->2). This means that if the starting material is (S), the product is also (S). The R/S descriptor is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction B:** Since the product is **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration. So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nTherefore, both reactions started with the same enantiomer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
