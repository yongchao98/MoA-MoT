    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of intermediate and final products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming **product 1**.\n    *   This reaction is an alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    *   CH3COOH + Br2 -> Br-CH2-COOH + HBr\n    *   **Product 1 is bromoacetic acid.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming **product 2**.\n    *   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3 + H2O\n    *   **Product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN), forming **product 3**.\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion (Br-).\n    *   Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3 + NaCN -> NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3 + NaBr\n    *   **Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming **final product 4**.\n    *   This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    *   First, the strong base NaH removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the CH2 group are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group -CN and an ester group -COOEt).\n        *   `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH -> [NC-CH-COOEt]- Na+ + H2`\n    *   The resulting carbanion (enolate) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular SN2 reaction.\n        *   `[NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br -> NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br`\n    *   Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the second acidic alpha-proton (now on the substituted carbon) is also removed, forming another carbanion.\n        *   `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH -> [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]- Na+ + H2`\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide. This forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4 is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry and count the distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4.**\n\nThe structure of product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is substituted with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This rapid flipping creates an \"averaged\" structure that possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C1 and C4 carbons and the substituents on C1. Protons that are chemically distinct will give separate signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. We must consider diastereotopicity.\n\n1.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **-O-CH2- protons:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is a prochiral center because it's bonded to four different groups: -CN, -COOEt, and the two different paths around the ring that are mirror images. A CH2 group attached to a prochiral center will have diastereotopic protons. Therefore, the two methylene protons of the ethyl group are chemically distinct. They will produce **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane ring protons (-C6H10-):**\n    The time-averaged structure has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4. This symmetry helps determine equivalency.\n    *   **C2 and C6 protons:** The CH2 group at C2 is equivalent to the CH2 group at C6 due to the plane of symmetry. However, within the CH2 group at C2, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to the prochiral center C1. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 signals** (one for the two \"cis-like\" protons, one for the two \"trans-like\" protons relative to a substituent).\n    *   **C3 and C5 protons:** Similarly, the CH2 group at C3 is equivalent to the CH2 group at C5. The two protons within the C3 group are diastereotopic because of their fixed spatial relationship to the rest of the asymmetric environment. Thus, the four protons on C3 and C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 protons:** The plane of symmetry passes through the C4 carbon, bisecting the H-C-H angle. The two protons on C4 are reflections of each other. They are enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. Thus, they produce **1 signal**.\n\n**Total number of signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH3) + 2 (for -OCH2-) = 3 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 5\nB) 12\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 8.\n\n<<<C>>>"
