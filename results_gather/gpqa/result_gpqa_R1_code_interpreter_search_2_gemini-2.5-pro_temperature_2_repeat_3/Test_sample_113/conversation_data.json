    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   The mechanism involves two steps:\n        1.  Nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻  --->  CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n        2.  Protonation of the negatively charged oxygen in the alkoxide intermediate to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n            `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺  --->  CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   Reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the second step. H₃O⁺ represents acidic aqueous conditions (e.g., adding HCl or H₂SO₄ to water), which is an excellent source of protons.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is used for a different type of nucleophilic addition reaction and is not the correct reagent here.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, along with water and heat. The problem specifies the presence of water (H₂O) and asks for reagent **B**, which acts as the catalyst.\n    *   `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O --(H⁺ or OH⁻)--> R-COOH + NH₃ (or NH₄⁺)`\n    *   Let's evaluate the options for B:\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the hydrolysis, the reaction would be extremely slow. For practical synthesis, a strong acid or strong base is used.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable choice.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺** and reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
