    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Principles of Quantum Measurement**\n\nThe problem involves a sequence of two measurements on a quantum system. The key principles are:\n*   The possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.\n*   The probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue is determined by the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n*   After a measurement, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the eigenvector corresponding to the measurement outcome. This new state is then used for any subsequent measurements.\n*   The probability of a sequence of measurements is the product of the probability of the first measurement and the conditional probability of the second measurement (given the state has collapsed).\n\n**2. Define the Given Quantities**\n\n*   Initial state vector: `|ψ⟩ = [[-1], [2], [1]]`\n*   Operator for observable P:\n    ```\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n*   Operator for observable Q:\n    ```\n    Q = [[1, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, -1]]\n    ```\n\n**3. First Measurement: Finding the Probability of P = 0**\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P:**\n    We need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `p = 0`. We solve the equation `P|v⟩ = p|v⟩`, which becomes `P|v⟩ = 0` for `p=0`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0],      [x]   [0]\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], *  [y] = [0]\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]      [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    From the first row: `(1/√2)y = 0` implies `y = 0`.\n    From the second row: `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` implies `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n    So, the eigenvector for `p=0` is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`.\n    To normalize it, the sum of the squares of its components must be 1: `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1` => `2x² = 1` => `x = 1/√2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|p₀⟩ = [[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability is given by `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.\n    First, calculate the squared norm of the initial state: `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    Next, calculate the inner product `⟨p₀|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * [[-1], [2], [1]] = (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1) = -1/√2 - 1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`.\n    Now, calculate the probability:\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-√2|² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3`.\n\n**4. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring `P=0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector, `|p₀⟩`.\nThe new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = [[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`.\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Finding the Probability of Q = -1**\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue q = -1:**\n    The operator `Q` is diagonal. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. For the eigenvalue `q = -1`, the corresponding normalized eigenvector is `|q₋₁⟩ = [[0], [0], [1]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 on the new state `|ψ'⟩`:**\n    This is the conditional probability `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|² / ⟨ψ'|ψ'⟩`.\n    Since `|ψ'⟩` is a normalized eigenvector, its norm `⟨ψ'|ψ'⟩` is 1.\n    Calculate the inner product `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩`:\n    `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * [[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]] = 0*(1/√2) + 0*(0) + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`.\n    Now, calculate the probability:\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Joint Probability**\n\nThe final step is to find the probability of the sequence of events: getting `P=0` AND THEN `Q=-1`. This is the product of the probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n`Prob(P=0 then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe final answer is 1/6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
