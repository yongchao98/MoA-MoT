    "The user wants me to find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass 'm' in a given 2D potential.\n\n**1. Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it is often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential energy function V is separable. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nFrom these, we can identify that `x² = r² cos²(θ)`. Substituting these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k (x²)\n\nNow, we can group the terms for x and y:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is now in a separated form, V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\nV_x(x) = 2kx²\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis means the 2D time-independent Schrödinger equation:\nHψ = Eψ\n(-ħ²/2m) (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²)ψ + (V_x(x) + V_y(y))ψ = Eψ\n\ncan be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations. We can write the total wavefunction as a product of functions of each variable, ψ(x, y) = ψ_x(x)ψ_y(y), and the total energy as a sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nThe two 1D equations are:\n1)  [-ħ²/2m d²/dx² + V_x(x)] ψ_x(x) = E_x ψ_x(x)  => [-ħ²/2m d²/dx² + 2kx²] ψ_x(x) = E_x ψ_x(x)\n2)  [-ħ²/2m d²/dy² + V_y(y)] ψ_y(y) = E_y ψ_y(y)  => [-ħ²/2m d²/dy² + 1/2 ky²] ψ_y(y) = E_y ψ_y(y)\n\n**3. Solve for the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nBoth of these equations are the standard form of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The energy levels for a 1D QHO with a potential U(q) = 1/2 Kq² are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(K/m).\n\nLet's find the energies for our two oscillators:\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nThe potential is V_x(x) = 2kx².\nComparing this to the standard form U(x) = 1/2 K_x x², we have:\n1/2 K_x = 2k  => K_x = 4k\nThe angular frequency for the x-motion is:\nω_x = sqrt(K_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nThe potential is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\nComparing this to the standard form U(y) = 1/2 K_y y², we have:\n1/2 K_y = 1/2 k  => K_y = k\nThe angular frequency for the y-motion is:\nω_y = sqrt(K_y / m) = sqrt(k/m)\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_nx and E_ny, where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nLet's factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
