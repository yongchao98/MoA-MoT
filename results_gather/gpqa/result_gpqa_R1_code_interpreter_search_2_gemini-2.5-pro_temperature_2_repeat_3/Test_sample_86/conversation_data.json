    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents attached. Let's represent the ring as C6H4. The substitution pattern could be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: A benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contribute a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as \"-X\".\n\n**2. Assemble the Pieces:**\n\n*   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   To reach a total of 8 carbons, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the 2 required carbon atoms.\n*   The only common and stable two-carbon group containing a carbonyl is the **acetyl group** (-C(=O)CH3).\n*   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C8H7XO. It has a halogen and an acetyl group attached to a benzene ring. The molecule has 4 aromatic protons and 3 protons on the methyl group, for a total of 7 protons.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum Based on the Structure:**\n\nNow we need to consider the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) and how it affects the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution):** If the halogen and acetyl group are para to each other (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone), the molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other.\n    *   It also makes the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other.\n    *   The aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) will show two signals, one for each pair of equivalent protons. Each proton is split by its single neighbor, so both signals will appear as **doublets**. Each doublet will integrate to **2H**.\n    *   The methyl protons of the acetyl group (-COCH3) have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet** that integrates to **3H**. This signal typically appears around 2.0-2.6 ppm because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Predicted para-spectrum:** A 2H doublet, another 2H doublet, and a 3H singlet.\n\n*   **Ortho or Meta-substitution:** In these cases, there is no symmetry plane bisecting the ring in the same way. All four aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region (e.g., four distinct signals, likely multiplets), not the simple pattern of two doublets.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\nLet's analyze the choices based on our prediction for the most likely isomer, the para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)`: A doublet for 2 protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   `7.6 (2H, d)`: A second doublet for 2 protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3 protons, consistent with a methyl ketone.\n    *   **This option perfectly matches our prediction for the para-substituted isomer.** The total proton count is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which is correct for C8H7XO.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   These chemical shifts are not in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer for an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at `9.9 ppm` is highly characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO). To have 8 carbons, the molecule would have to be, for example, a halo-methyl-benzaldehyde. This would be a tri-substituted ring, which contradicts the \"di-substituted\" information. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is inconsistent. The signals at 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are not aromatic, and the splitting patterns and integrations do not fit the deduced structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum should consist of two doublets in the aromatic region (each for 2H) and one singlet in the aliphatic region (for 3H). Option A is the only choice that matches this description.\n\n<<<A>>>"
