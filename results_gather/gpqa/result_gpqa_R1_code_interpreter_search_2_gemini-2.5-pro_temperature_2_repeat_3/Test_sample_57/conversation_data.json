    "*   **Classical Electrodynamics (A):** This theory suffers from the problem of infinite self-energy for point charges. The energy stored in the electric field of a point charge diverges as one approaches the charge. This is a high-energy/short-distance problem that requires some form of regularization, like assuming the charge has a small, finite radius.\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) (B):** This is a quantum field theory. When calculating physical quantities using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams), integrals over the momenta of virtual particles in loops often diverge at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). A procedure called regularization is necessary to make these integrals temporarily finite so that they can be absorbed into a redefinition of physical parameters (mass, charge) through a process called renormalization. Thus, QED explicitly requires regularization.\n*   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) (C):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory that describes the strong force. It also has ultraviolet divergences in its loop calculations that must be treated with regularization and renormalization.\n*   **Superstring Theory (D):** One of the primary motivations for superstring theory is to solve the high-energy problems that plague quantum field theories, particularly the incompatibility of general relativity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional vibrating strings. This inherent \"fuzziness\" or extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at very short distances (high energies). As a result, the loop diagrams in string theory do not have the ultraviolet divergences found in point-particle theories. The theory is believed to be UV-finite, meaning it does not require an ad-hoc regularization procedure for high energies. The finite size of the string acts as a natural physical regulator.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the theory that is believed not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
