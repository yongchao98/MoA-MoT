    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles.**\n    This problem involves a harmonic oscillator, so we will use the concept of potential energy associated with a spring-like force. The motion is relativistic, so we must use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy and the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energy components.**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, F = -kx. The potential energy U(x) is found by integrating the force:\n        U(x) = -∫₀ˣ F(x') dx' = -∫₀ˣ (-kx') dx' = (1/2)kx².\n        We set the potential energy to zero at the equilibrium position (x=0).\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle with mass m moving at speed v is given by:\n        K = (γ - 1)mc²\n        where γ (the Lorentz factor) is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy.**\n    The problem describes a conservative system (the force depends only on position). Therefore, the total mechanical energy E_mech = K + U is conserved.\n    E_mech = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx² = constant.\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at two key points.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude (x = A).**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is v = 0.\n        At v = 0, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n        The kinetic energy is K = (1 - 1)mc² = 0.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum, U_max = (1/2)kA².\n        The total mechanical energy is E_mech = 0 + (1/2)kA².\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position (x = 0).**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is U = (1/2)k(0)² = 0.\n        The speed is at its maximum, v = v_max.\n        The Lorentz factor is γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum, K_max = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n        The total mechanical energy is E_mech = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    (1/2)kA² = (γ_max - 1)mc²\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for v_max.\n    *   First, isolate γ_max:\n        (kA²)/(2mc²) = γ_max - 1\n        γ_max = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of γ_max:\n        1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        1 / (1 - v_max²/c²) = (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    *   Rearrange to solve for v_max²/c²:\n        v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\n    *   Finally, take the square root and multiply by c to find v_max:\n        v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²]\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for v_max is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
