    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix form of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, which is evident from the diagonal form of the $P_z$ matrix.\n    *   Extra information is provided about operators $P_x$ and $P_y$, and that the given state is an eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. While this information is useful to fully define the context (this is a spin-1 system), it is not required to calculate the uncertainty in $P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for uncertainty:**\n    The uncertainty of an operator $A$, denoted by $\\Delta A$, in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined as:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of A.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to our problem:**\n    We need to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, so the formula is:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, i.e., $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since the components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, it's just the transpose:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    Let's first calculate $P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, multiply by $\\langle \\psi |$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$, i.e., $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    First calculate $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    Now, multiply by $\\langle \\psi |$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Substitute the calculated values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option D. I can verify the calculations with a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define h_bar as a symbolic variable would be ideal, but for numerical\n# verification, we'll set it to 1.0 and add it back at the end.\nh_bar = 1.0\n\n# The state vector |psi>\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\n\n# The operator Pz in units of h_bar\nPz_over_hbar = np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, -1]])\nPz = h_bar * Pz_over_hbar\n\n# Conjugate transpose of psi, <psi|\npsi_bra = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate <Pz> = <psi| Pz |psi>\nexp_Pz = psi_bra @ Pz @ psi\nexp_Pz_val = exp_Pz[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate Pz^2\nPz_sq = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate <Pz^2> = <psi| Pz^2 |psi>\nexp_Pz_sq = psi_bra @ Pz_sq @ psi\nexp_Pz_sq_val = exp_Pz_sq[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate uncertainty Delta Pz\nvariance = exp_Pz_sq_val - exp_Pz_val**2\nuncertainty = np.sqrt(variance)\n\n# We want the answer in terms of h_bar\n# <Pz> = 0 * h_bar\n# <Pz^2> = 0.5 * h_bar^2\n# variance = 0.5 * h_bar^2\n# uncertainty = sqrt(0.5) * h_bar\nprint(f\"The calculated uncertainty is sqrt({variance / (h_bar**2)}) * h_bar\")\nprint(f\"Numerically, this is {uncertainty / h_bar} * h_bar\")\nprint(f\"sqrt(1/2) is {np.sqrt(1/2)}\")\n\n```\nThe code confirms the analytical calculation.

    "The uncertainty of an operator $A$ is given by the formula $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$, where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator A.
