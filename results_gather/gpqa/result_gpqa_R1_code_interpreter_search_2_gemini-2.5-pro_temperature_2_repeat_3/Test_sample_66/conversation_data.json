    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\Psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The total angular momentum is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the desired final state:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $L_{z}$ are given by $m_z \\hbar$. So, we are looking for the outcome where the magnetic quantum number for the first electron is $m_1 = -1$ and for the second electron is $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\Phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum measurement:**\n    *   The probability of measuring a system initially in state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ and finding it in a specific state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states: $P = |\\langle\\Phi|\\Psi\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our case, the probability is $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the conservation of angular momentum:**\n    *   The initial state $|\\Psi\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement on the state must yield a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state we are considering is $|\\Phi\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$. Let's find its total z-component of angular momentum. It is also an eigenstate of $L_z$.\n        $L_z |\\Phi\\rangle = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle = (L_{1z}|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(L_{2z}|1, -1\\rangle)$\n        $= (-\\hbar|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(-\\hbar|1, -1\\rangle) = (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |\\Phi\\rangle = -2\\hbar |\\Phi\\rangle$.\n    *   So, the final state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ has a total z-component of angular momentum eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n    *   Since the initial state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ and the potential final state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively), they must be orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, their inner product is zero: $\\langle\\Phi|\\Psi\\rangle = \\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   The probability is $P = |\\langle\\Phi|\\Psi\\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Alternative method using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:**\n    *   The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$:\n        $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n    *   The coefficients $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ are called Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The probability of measuring the system in the state $|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    *   In our case, we want the probability for the outcome $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n    *   The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
