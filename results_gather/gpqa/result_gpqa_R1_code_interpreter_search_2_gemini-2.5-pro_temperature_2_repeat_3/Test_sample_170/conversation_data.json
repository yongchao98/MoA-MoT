    "This question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. The weight fraction will be proportional to the mole fraction, so we need to determine the relative yields of the para-isomer for each reaction.\n\nThe position of electrophilic substitution on a substituted benzene ring is governed by the nature of the substituent already present. Substituents can be classified as either *ortho,para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\n1.  **Classify the substituents:**\n\n    *   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n        *   -CH3 (Toluene, 1): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating, o,p-director.\n        *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very little of the ortho and para isomers.\n        *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating, m-director.\n        *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n2.  **Establish the general order:**\n\n    The m-directing compounds will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while the o,p-directing compounds will have the highest yield. Therefore, the three m-directing substances (4, 2, 6) must come before the three o,p-directing substances (1, 5, 3) in the final ranking.\n\n3.  **Order the meta-directors (lowest para-yields):**\n\n    All these substances (Nitrobenzene, Ethyl benzoate, Benzoic acid) will give the meta-isomer as the major product. The para-isomer is a very minor product. We need to compare how minor it is.\n\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating and meta-directing groups. The yield of the para-isomer in bromination is extremely low, typically less than 1%.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The -COOH group is also a strong meta-director. The para-isomer yield is very low, typically around 1-2%. This is slightly higher than for nitrobenzene.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The -COOC2H5 group is a meta-director, with deactivating strength similar to -COOH. Data for similar reactions (like chlorination) suggests a para-yield of around 5%, which is higher than for both nitrobenzene and benzoic acid.\n\n    So, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    Order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n4.  **Order the ortho,para-directors (highest para-yields):**\n\n    For o,p-directors, the final product is a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is determined by a combination of electronic and steric factors. The para position is sterically less hindered than the two ortho positions, so it is often the major product, especially when the substituent or the attacking electrophile is large. Bromine is a relatively large electrophile.\n\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** Halogens like chlorine are o,p-directors. Due to a combination of their electronic properties and moderate size, they show a very high preference for the para position in many reactions. For bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer accounts for about 88% of the product mixture. This is a very high para-selectivity.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH3:** The methyl group in toluene is an o,p-director. It is small, so steric hindrance at the ortho position is not extreme. Bromination of toluene yields about 67% of the para-isomer.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5:** The ethyl group in ethylbenzene is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk makes attack at the ortho position more difficult compared to toluene. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is favored even more. The yield of the para-isomer will be higher than for toluene (i.e., > 67%) but generally not as high as for chlorobenzene.\n\n    So, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n5.  **Combine the groups to get the final order:**\n\n    Combining the order of the two groups gives the final sequence from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:\n\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
