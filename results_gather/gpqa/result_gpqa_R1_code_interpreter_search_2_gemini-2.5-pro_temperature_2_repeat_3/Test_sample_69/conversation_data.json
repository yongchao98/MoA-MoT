    "Here is my reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll analyze the provided chemical reactions to identify the unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: D + B (1:1 ratio) -> H (solvent)**\n        *   This clue describes a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A classic example of such a reaction is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n        *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l/g)\n        *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is known as a solvent (boiling point 8°C) and is notoriously hazardous. This seems like a very strong candidate.\n        *   So, I'll hypothesize that {B, D} = {CO, Cl₂} and H = COCl₂.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> Bright red product C**\n        *   Let's test the two possibilities for gas B.\n        *   **Case 1: B = Cl₂.** The reaction would be `A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) -> C(red)`. Finding a solid A that reacts with 8 molecules of chlorine is difficult and doesn't point to common chemical compounds.\n        *   **Case 2: B = CO.** The reaction is `A(s) + 8 CO(g) -> C(red)`. This strongly suggests the formation of a metal carbonyl. A well-known metal carbonyl with a red/orange color is dicobalt octacarbonyl, Co₂(CO)₈.\n        *   The reaction is: `2 Co(s) + 8 CO(g) -> Co₂(CO)₈(s)`.\n        *   Here, A would be solid Cobalt (Co), B is Carbon Monoxide (CO), and C is Dicobalt Octacarbonyl (Co₂(CO)₈).\n        *   The stoichiometry \"Solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B\" can be interpreted as referring to the 8 CO ligands present in the product C, even though the reactant stoichiometry is 2A:8B. This is a common ambiguity in chemical puzzles. This hypothesis seems much more plausible than Case 1.\n\n    *   **Consolidating the hypothesis so far:**\n        *   A = Co (Cobalt)\n        *   B = CO (Carbon Monoxide)\n        *   C = Co₂(CO)₈ (Dicobalt octacarbonyl)\n        *   D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n        *   H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n    *   **Clue 3: C + Water -> A + Acid F + Acid G (F=strong, G=weak)**\n        *   The reaction would be `Co₂(CO)₈ + H₂O -> Co + F + G`. The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls is complex. This clue might be simplified or intended to be confusing. If B were Cl₂, this clue would work perfectly (`Cl₂ + H₂O -> HCl (strong) + HOCl (weak)`). However, based on Clue 1, B=CO is more likely. Given the strength of the other clues, I will proceed assuming the identities from above are correct and this clue might be a red herring or requires non-standard chemistry.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> Extremely hazardous product E**\n        *   Substituting our identified compounds: `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ -> E`.\n        *   We need to determine the product E. Chlorine is an oxidizing agent and will react with the cobalt carbonyl. It can cleave the Co-Co bond and displace the CO ligands. A plausible, balanced reaction where C is completely consumed by 2 equivalents of D is:\n            `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → 2 Co + 2 COCl₂ + 6 CO`\n        *   Let's check the balance of atoms. Reactants: 2 Co, 8 C, 8 O, 4 Cl. Products: 2 Co, (2+6) C, (2+6) O, 4 Cl. The equation is balanced.\n        *   This reaction produces cobalt metal (A), phosgene (COCl₂), and carbon monoxide (B).\n        *   The problem asks for \"the extremely hazardous product E\". Phosgene (COCl₂) is famously and extremely hazardous (it's a chemical weapon). This is a perfect fit for E.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n\n    *   We have identified E as phosgene, **COCl₂**.\n    *   To find its molecular symmetry group, we need to analyze its 3D structure.\n    *   The central atom is carbon. It is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, the three electron domains around the central carbon atom will arrange themselves in a trigonal planar geometry to minimize repulsion. The molecule is planar.\n    *   The structure looks like this:\n            O\n           //\n          C\n         / \\\n       Cl   Cl\n    *   Now, let's identify the symmetry elements:\n        1.  **C₂ axis:** There is a twofold rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond. Rotating the molecule 180° around this axis leaves the O and C unchanged and swaps the positions of the two Cl atoms, resulting in an identical-looking molecule.\n        2.  **σv mirror plane:** One mirror plane is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        3.  **σ'v mirror plane:** A second mirror plane is perpendicular to the molecular plane and passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule that possesses an identity element (E), a C₂ axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σv) containing the axis belongs to the **C₂v** point group.\n\n3.  **Match with Options:**\n    The determined point group for E (phosgene) is C₂v. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
