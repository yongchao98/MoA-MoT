    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a system whose potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning $V(x,y,z) = V(x) + V(y) + V(z)$, where each component is a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator potential:\n$V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$\n$V(y) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2$\n$V(z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$\n\n**1. Finding the Energy Eigenvalue**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\nSince the potential is separable, the total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy formula simplifies to:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nNow, we need to find the energy of the third excited state. Let's identify the states:\n*   **Ground State:** The lowest energy level corresponds to the smallest possible value of $N$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$, the minimum value is $N=0$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** The next highest energy level corresponds to $N=1$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $N=2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** The energy level we are interested in corresponds to $N=3$.\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Finding the Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions)**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to get $N=3$.\n\nThe combinations are:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - (3 states)\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - (6 states)\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nA general formula for the degeneracy $g_N$ of the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\nFor our case, $N=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
