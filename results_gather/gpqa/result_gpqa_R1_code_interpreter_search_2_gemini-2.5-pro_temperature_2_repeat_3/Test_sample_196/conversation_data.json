  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given IR and NMR data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid (often around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet for one proton in this downfield region is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is likely from the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is from the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl group signals:** Let's piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives a `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl) fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This gives a `-CH(CH₃)` fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons, which corresponds to the `-CH₂-` part of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the terminal -CH₃ and the methine (-CH-) group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This must be the `-CH-` group. Its chemical shift is relatively downfield because it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring) and coupled to the protons of the adjacent -CH₃ and -CH₂- groups.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We connect the fragments. The benzylic carbon is the methine (`-CH-`). This methine is attached to a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`). This forms a ` -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)` group, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the reaction and the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The reactant, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents Function:** Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent system. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH₃). The benzene ring and the existing alkyl (sec-butyl) group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be converted to a methyl group.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is structurally incorrect and still an acid.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
