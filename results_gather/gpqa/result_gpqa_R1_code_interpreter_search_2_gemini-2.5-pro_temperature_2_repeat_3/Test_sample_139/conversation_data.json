    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the information provided in the prompt step by step.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X**\n        *   Incorporates a \"heavier isotope\" of one of its elements. This immediately brings to mind deuterium (D or ²H) as a common heavier isotope used in chemistry.\n        *   X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards a common reagent family where isotopic labeling is frequent, for example, reducing agents like NaBH₄/NaBD₄ or LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Reaction of X with Y**\n        *   X reacts \"violently\" with a liquid Y. This is characteristic of reactions like alkali metals with water, or powerful hydrides/deuterides with water.\n        *   A gas W is released.\n        *   The key property of W is that its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons (n=p). Let's test some simple gas molecules:\n            *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n            *   He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n, but unlikely product from this kind of reaction)\n            *   CH₄ (Methane): 10 protons, 6 neutrons. (p≠n)\n            *   NH₃ (Ammonia): 10 protons, 7 neutrons. (p≠n)\n            *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): 14 protons (6+8), 14 neutrons (6+8). (p=n). Possible, but not a typical product of a violent reaction with a liquid like water.\n            *   N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p=n). Unlikely product.\n            *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas)**: A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the condition (p=n) and aligns perfectly with Clue 1 about a heavier isotope. This is the most promising candidate for W.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G and Substance B**\n        *   A precipitate G is formed during the reaction.\n        *   Heating G releases B.\n        *   B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\". Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)** is 3.82 °C. This is a near-perfect match. So, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   If heating precipitate G releases D₂O, then G must be a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen, likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating (e.g., 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify X, Y, G:**\n\n    *   We have deduced: W = D₂, B = D₂O, G = M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   The overall reaction involves X reacting with Y to produce D₂ and M(OD)ₓ.\n    *   Let's consider the reaction: `X + Y → D₂(g) + M(OD)ₓ(s)`.\n    *   For the products to be D₂ and M(OD)ₓ, both reactants must be rich in deuterium. If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction would produce HD gas, not pure D₂.\n    *   Therefore, the liquid **Y must be heavy water, D₂O**.\n    *   Now, what is X? We need a substance that reacts with D₂O to form D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate. Let's revisit the idea from Clue 1: a reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test **X = Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   It \"incorporates a heavier isotope\" (D), satisfying Clue 1.\n        *   Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄, a very common organic reagent, satisfying the second part of Clue 1.\n        *   The reaction with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is:\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas)`\n        *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n        *   Gas W = D₂ (p=n). This matches.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃. This matches.\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) yields Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This matches.\n    *   This seems to be a fully consistent identification. **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Verify with the Final Clue:**\n\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms. Example: Pyruvic acid, CH₃-CO-COOH (3 oxygens).\n    *   X = LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces a ketone to an alcohol (>CD-OH) and a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂-OH).\n    *   So, a keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH) is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂-OH).\n    *   A diol has exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄), considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all...must be summed.\"\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We will use integer mass numbers, as suggested by the options.\n        *   Deuterium (D, or ²H): Mass number = **2**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Most common isotope is ⁷Li. Mass number = **7**\n        *   Aluminium (Al): The only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass number = **27**\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:\n        *   Lightest element: Deuterium (mass 2).\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (mass 27).\n    *   Calculate the cumulative mass as instructed. We must sum the masses for all instances of these elements in the formula LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
