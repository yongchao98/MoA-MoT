    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Core:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". A benzene ring is C6H6. When it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups. This means the core of the molecule is a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum shows the presence of an ester group. An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one C-O single bond. This accounts for one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-). All four options provided have two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the presence of an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substituents using 1H NMR Data:** The 1H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule, which helps us determine the structure of the substituents.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: The C6H4 ring has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a high degree of symmetry, such as a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons closer to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons closer to the other substituent are also equivalent, leading to two distinct signals.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are those attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a **doublet of quartets (dq)** is split by two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet, n+1=2 -> n=1) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, n+1=4 -> n=3). This strongly suggests a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to another proton on the double bond AND a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   A signal that is a **doublet (d)** is split by only one neighboring proton (n+1=2 -> n=1).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton next to the CH3 is the \"dq\", and the other vinyl proton is the \"d\". This substituent has a formula of -C3H5 and accounts for one of the methyl groups.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second -CH3 group must be associated with the ester.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical piece of information. Common esters like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) contain a -CH2- group. Since there are no -CH2- signals, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester or any other ester with a -CH2- link. The simplest ester that fits this description and accounts for the second -CH3 signal is a **methyl ester** (-COOCH3). This fragment accounts for the -COO- part and the second -CH3 group. Its formula is -COOCH3, which adds -C2H3O2 to the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** Now we can sum the atoms from all the identified pieces of the molecule:\n    *   Di-substituted benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group substituent: -C3H5\n    *   Methyl ester group substituent: -COOCH3, which is C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The proposed structure, for example methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
