    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will preferentially add to the positions ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) to the methyl group.\n*   Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para product is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** We assume the major product is formed, which is **para-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene or 4-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent, often used for the selective oxidation of benzylic positions. A benzylic methyl group can be oxidized to an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Path A:** Complete oxidation to a carboxylic acid would yield p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n    *   **Path B:** Partial oxidation would yield p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n*   Let's evaluate the next step to determine which path is more plausible. If Product 2 were p-nitrobenzoic acid, its reaction with acetone and NaOH (Step 3) would primarily be an acid-base reaction forming sodium p-nitrobenzoate. Further reaction (like Meisenheimer complex formation) would lead to a molecule with C₁ symmetry, which is not among the options.\n*   Therefore, let's proceed with Path B, which is more likely to lead to a subsequent standard reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** **para-nitrobenzaldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde)**. This assumes a controlled oxidation stopping at the aldehyde stage, which is a common scenario in textbook problems to allow for a subsequent named reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation between an aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). Specifically, it's a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n    1.  The base (NaOH) removes an α-proton from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  An initial aldol addition product is formed, which then readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) because the resulting double bond is highly conjugated with both the benzene ring and the carbonyl group.\n*   **The Reaction Sequence:**\n    p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CHO + CH₃COCH₃ --(NaOH, H₂O)--> p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH(OH)-CH₂COCH₃\n    p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH(OH)-CH₂COCH₃ --(-H₂O)--> p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, **4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one**. Due to sterics, the more stable *trans* (E) isomer is expected to be the major product.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one.\n    The structure is `p-NO₂-Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Planarity:** The molecule has an extensive system of conjugated π-bonds (benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). This forces the molecule into a planar or nearly planar conformation to maximize orbital overlap and stability.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's assume the molecule lies in a plane.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Rotational Axes (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotational axes. A C₂ axis passing through the nitro and phenyl groups, for example, would not map the `-CH=CH-CO-CH₃` side chain onto itself.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** The plane containing all the atoms of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Any atom in the plane is reflected onto itself. There are no other mirror planes (e.g., perpendicular to the molecular plane).\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) D₂ₕ\nB) Cₛ\nC) C₂ₕ\nD) C₃\n\nThe calculated point group Cₛ matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
