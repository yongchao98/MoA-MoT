    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n    *   The substituents are: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   Crucially, all three substituents are **meta** to each other. The Br is meta to the acetyl group, the NO2 is meta to the acetyl group, and the Br and NO2 are meta to each other (positions 3 and 5 are meta). This 1,3,5-substitution pattern is key.\n\n2.  **Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we must understand how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Possible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    The goal is to add these three groups in an order that produces the correct 1,3,5 arrangement.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Add the acetyl group last.** This would require a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group. So, this strategy is not viable.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Use the directing properties of the groups.** The all-meta arrangement suggests that we should start by introducing a meta-directing group. The acetyl group is a good candidate.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Options Step-by-Step:**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n        i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n        ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n        iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. This reaction fails because the nitrogen of the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a positively charged complex, which strongly deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Thus, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene\n        ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4: Bromine is an ortho-, para-director. This step will produce a mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene. It will not produce the required meta-isomer (m-bromonitrobenzene) in significant yield. This path does not lead to the required 1,3 relationship between the first two groups. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n        The first four steps are:\n        i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n        ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n        iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride\n        iv) Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 -> Benzene (deamination)\n        This sequence of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, achieving nothing. The effective synthesis would then start from step (v) on a fresh molecule of benzene. This sequence (v, vi, vii) is: Benzene -> Bromobenzene -> p-Bromoacetophenone -> 4-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone, which is not the target product. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        Let's analyze this sequence carefully:\n        i) **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to the ring. The acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n        ii) **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is electrophilic bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This step is correct.\n        iii) **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is nitration. The ring now has two groups: -COCH3 at C1 (meta-director) and -Br at C3 (o,p-director).\n            *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n            *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to C2, C4, and C6.\n            *   We have conflicting directors. However, we must consider the stability of the intermediate carbocation (sigma complex). Attack at positions ortho or para to the bromine (C2, C4, C6) leads to highly unstable intermediates because a resonance structure would place a positive charge on a carbon atom directly bonded to the deactivating acetyl group. Attack at C5, while electronically deactivated, results in a more stable sigma complex where the positive charge is never adjacent to the acetyl carbon. Therefore, the major product of this reaction is indeed **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired molecule.\n\n        The first three steps of option B constitute a valid and logical synthesis of the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv through vii) are superfluous and would modify the correct product, suggesting a possible error in the question's formulation. However, compared to the other options which contain definitive chemical impossibilities or incorrect regiochemistry in their crucial steps, option B is the only one that contains a correct synthetic route.\n\n<<<B>>>"
