    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This is a key assumption. It means that the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume and Distance:**\n    *   The number of stars (N) in any given volume (V) is simply the product of the number density and the volume: `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars within a certain distance `d` from the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   So, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Stars in a Thin Spherical Shell:**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range*. This requires a differential approach. Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell between radius `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`): `dV = 4πd²dd`.\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd²dd`.\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The standard definition is `d = 1/plx` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   Our goal is to express the number of stars per unit range of *parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of *distance* (`dN/dd`).\n\n5.  **Convert the Differential `dd` to `d(plx)`:**\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the small distance interval `dd` and the small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   Since we are concerned with the number of stars in a range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign, which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. So, `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the `dN` Equation:**\n    *   Start with our equation for the number of stars in a shell: `dN = ρ * 4πd²dd`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:**\n    *   The quantity we want is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the relationship is:\n    *   `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
