    "This problem requires us to determine which of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT Unit Telescope (UT) under specific conditions. There are two main criteria for a star to be detectable:\n1.  **Observational Viability**: The star must be visible from the location of the observatory.\n2.  **Brightness**: The star must be bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the given exposure time.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Limiting Apparent Magnitude (V)**\n\nThe problem states a star is detectable if an S/N of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure. We need to find the apparent V-band magnitude that corresponds to this limit for ESPRESSO on a single 8m VLT.\n\n*   A web search for \"ESPRESSO limiting magnitude S/N 10 1 hour\" or consulting the provided ESO link reveals this information. The official ESO page for ESPRESSO, in the 'Salient Features' table, specifies that for the 1-UT mode (one VLT Unit Telescope), an S/N of 10 is reached in 1 hour for a star of V-band magnitude **V = 16**.\n*   Therefore, our first criterion is: **A star is bright enough if its apparent magnitude V <= 16.**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\n\nA star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n\n*   A search for \"latitude of Paranal Observatory\" shows it is located at approximately **-24.6 degrees** (24.6 degrees South).\n*   For an observatory at latitude L, the highest a celestial pole will be is at an altitude equal to |L|. The lowest point a celestial pole will reach is at an altitude equal to -|L|. So at Paranal (a southern observatory) the south celestial pole is at an altitude of 24.6°, and the north celestial pole is at an altitude of -24.6° i.e., it is 24.6° below the northern horizon. The northernmost declination that can be observed is limited.\n*   A simplified rule is that a star is observable if its maximum altitude is reasonably above the horizon. The maximum altitude (A_max) for a star with declination (δ) at an observatory with latitude (L) is given by: A_max = 90° - |L - δ|. For an object to be visible at all, A_max must be > 0. For Polaris at DEC ≈ +89°, at Paranal (L = -24.6°), the maximum altitude would be 90° - |-24.6° - 89°| = 90° - 113.6° = -23.6°. Since the maximum altitude is negative, Polaris is never above the horizon.\n*   A more general rule for a southern observatory (L < 0) is that a star with declination δ will not rise if δ > 90° + L. For Paranal, L = -24.6°, so any star with **DEC > 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°** is not observable.\n*   Our second criterion is: **A star is visible if its declination DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now apply these two criteria to each star listed. For stars c, d, e, and f, we must first calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: **m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5** (where d is in parsecs).\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Search**: Canopus has an apparent magnitude V = -0.74 and declination DEC = -52.7°.\n*   **Brightness Check**: -0.74 <= 16. (Pass)\n*   **Visibility Check**: -52.7° < +65.4°. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion**: **Detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Search**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude V ≈ +1.98 and declination DEC = +89.26°.\n*   **Brightness Check**: +1.98 <= 16. (Pass)\n*   **Visibility Check**: +89.26° is not < +65.4°. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion**: **Not Detectable** (because it's never visible from Paranal).\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 mag, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Calculation**: m_V = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15.0. Declination is 0°.\n*   **Brightness Check**: 15.0 <= 16. (Pass)\n*   **Visibility Check**: 0° < +65.4°. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion**: **Detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 mag, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Calculation**: m_V = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(2.301) - 5 ≈ 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.5. Declination is 0°.\n*   **Brightness Check**: 21.5 is not <= 16. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion**: **Not Detectable** (it's too faint).\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 mag, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Calculation**: m_V = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(0.699) - 5 ≈ 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.5. Declination is 0°.\n*   **Brightness Check**: 13.5 <= 16. (Pass)\n*   **Visibility Check**: 0° < +65.4°. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion**: **Detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 mag, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Calculation**: m_V = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(1.699) - 5 ≈ 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.5. Declination is 0°.\n*   **Brightness Check**: 18.5 is not <= 16. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion**: **Not Detectable** (it's too faint).\n\n**Step 4: Count the Detectable Stars**\n\nThe stars that meet both criteria are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc\n3.  Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc\n\nA total of **3** stars are detectable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
