    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) - 0 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   This leaves 1 degree of unsaturation, which is typically a carbonyl group (C=O) or another double bond (C=C, C=N).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (above 3300 cm-1) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2). One band is from the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is from the symmetric N-H stretch.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (~1680 cm-1) but is characteristic of an ester, specifically an aryl ester or α,β-unsaturated ester (~1715-1730 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). The chemical shift suggests a methyl group (-CH3) in an aliphatic environment. This pattern is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH3 group (n+1 rule, 3+1=4). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm suggests this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl: **-CO-O-CH2-CH3**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet represents 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in O-H or N-H bonds. Given the IR data suggesting a primary amine, this signal is assigned to the two protons of the -NH2 group. The broadening is due to quadropolar coupling with nitrogen and/or chemical exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the two pairs of ortho/meta protons to be non-equivalent.\n        *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is relatively upfield for an aromatic proton, suggesting these protons are ortho to an electron-donating group (EDG), like the -NH2 group.\n        *   The signal at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, suggesting these protons are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), like the ester group (-COOR).\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  We have a **primary amine** (-NH2).\n    2.  We have an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement**.\n\n    Let's draw this structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n        NH2\n         |\n       /---\\\n    H_c|   |H_b\n       \\---/\n         |\n        C(=O)-O-CH2(a)-CH3(a)\n\n    *   This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 (C6H4 + C + O2 + N + C2H5 = C9H11NO2).\n    *   It has the -NH2 group (IR: 3420, 3325 cm-1; NMR: 4.0 ppm).\n    *   It has the ethyl ester group (IR: 1720 cm-1; NMR: 4.5 ppm (q, -O-CH2-) and 1.20 ppm (t, -CH3)).\n    *   It has a para-substituted ring where the amine group (EDG) shields its ortho protons (H_c, at ~7.0 ppm) and the ester group (EWG) deshields its ortho protons (H_b, at ~8.0 ppm).\n\nThis structure is a perfect match for all the given data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our derived structure perfectly.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted (would give a more complex aromatic NMR spectrum) and is an amide (wrong C=O IR frequency).\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide (wrong N-H signals in IR), and would have a distinct formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR around 8.2 ppm.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester group is -O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR signal for the -CH2- next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
