    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. All atoms defining the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane (`Cl`, `H` on C1, `CH3`, `C2H5` on C2, and C1, C2) acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **achiral** and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using descriptors like `(3aR,7aS)` for chiral centers and `(E)` for a double bond. When a name designates a specific configuration (like R or S) for its chiral centers, it describes a molecule that is part of a set of stereoisomers. While it's possible for a molecule with R and S centers to be an achiral meso compound, the presence of the complex, unsymmetrical `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)` substituent on what is likely a bicyclic anhydride core makes it virtually certain that any potential plane of symmetry in the parent structure is eliminated. A specifically named enantiomer or diastereomer like this is chiral unless it is a meso compound. Given the complexity and lack of symmetry, it's chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** and therefore optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3) which are identically substituted. The designation `(2R,3S)` indicates that these two identical chiral centers have opposite configurations. This is the definition of a meso compound. Meso compounds contain an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule into two halves that are mirror images of each other. In a staggered conformation, it possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound is a diastereomer of the meso form discussed above. The `(2R,3R)` designation indicates that the two chiral centers have the same configuration. This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** and therefore optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond from C3 to C4 and an OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** and therefore optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three substituents are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring's average plane. More importantly, it has three planes of symmetry (Ïƒv), each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **achiral** and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name `...butan-1-one` specifies a four-carbon chain with the carbonyl group at C1. The substituent `3-methyl` indicates a methyl group on C3. However, on a butane chain, the positions C2 and C3 are equivalent by renumbering from the other end. So, a monosubstituted butane can only be `2-methylbutane`. The name `3-methylbutane` is invalid. This implies a typo in the question. The most likely intended name is **`1-cyclopentyl-2-methylbutan-1-one`**.\n    *   **Intended Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality of Intended Structure:** In this molecule, C2 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -CH3, (3) -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and (4) -C(=O)-Cyclopentyl. Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Assuming the typo, the intended molecule is **chiral**. In the context of \"will exhibit optical activity\", we consider the property of the molecule itself (chirality). Therefore, it is counted as optically **active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-... : **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Active** (based on correction of likely typo)\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
