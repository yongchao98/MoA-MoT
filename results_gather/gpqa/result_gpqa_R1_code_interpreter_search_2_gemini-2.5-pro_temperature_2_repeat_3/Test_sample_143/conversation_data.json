    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance, $L$, of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle moving at velocity $v$ is given by $L = v \\times T_{lab}$, where $T_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame ($T_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime in the particle's rest frame ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$): $T_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   Substituting this, the formula for the mean decay distance becomes $L = v \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   The velocity can be expressed as $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$ and $c$ is the speed of light. So, $L = (\\beta \\gamma) (c \\tau)$.\n    *   The proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Substituting $\\tau$, we get $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Components of the Formula:**\n    We are given:\n    *   Total energy $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Decay width $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the equation $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$:\n\n    *   **The factor $\\beta\\gamma$:** This boost-related term can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X}$. The factor $\\beta$ is related by $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n        Alternatively, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can find the momentum $p$. The factor $\\beta\\gamma$ is then equal to $p/m$ (in units where $c=1$, or more generally $pc/mc^2$). Let's use this method as it's more direct.\n        Let's denote energy-equivalent momentum and mass as $p_E = pc$ and $m_E = mc^2$.\n        $p_E = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} = \\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\text{ MeV} = \\sqrt{62,560,000}$ MeV.\n        The dimensionless ratio is $\\frac{p_E}{m_E} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000} \\text{ MeV}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 6.59124$. This is our $\\beta\\gamma$.\n\n    *   **The rest frame decay length ($c\\tau$):** This is calculated as $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$. We use the standard value for the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327$ MeV路fm.\n        $c\\tau = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV路fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.61665$ fm.\n        (Note: 1 femtometer (fm) = $10^{-15}$ meters (m)).\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Answer:**\n    Now, we multiply the two parts together:\n    $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\times (c \\tau) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV路fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}\\right)$\n    $L \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.61665 \\text{ fm} \\approx 4.0655$ fm.\n\n    Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$, the mean decay distance is:\n    $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values in GeV\nE_X_GeV = 8.0\nm_X_GeV = 1.2\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0\n\n# Convert all energy units to MeV for consistency\nE_X_MeV = E_X_GeV * 1000\nm_X_MeV = m_X_GeV * 1000\n\n# Physical constant hbar*c in MeV*fm\nhbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n# The formula for the mean decay distance L is L = (p/m) * (hbar*c / Gamma)\n# where p is the relativistic momentum.\n\n# 1.

    "The user has requested the solution again. Here is the step-by-step reasoning, re-confirming the previous result.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to compute the mean decay distance, denoted by $L$, of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Underlying Physics Principles:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) in the lab frame and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$): $L = v \\cdot T_{\\text{lab}}$.\n    *   Relativistic time dilation connects the lifetime in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$) to the particle's proper lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau$) via the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $T_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   Substituting this into the distance formula gives: $L = v \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   We can write the velocity as $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta = v/c$. The formula becomes $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot (c\\tau)$.\n    *   The term $(c\\tau)$ represents the mean distance the particle would travel in its rest frame if it could, which we call the proper decay length. This is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, so $c\\tau = \\hbar c / \\Gamma$.\n    *   The term $(\\beta\\gamma)$ is a dimensionless factor representing the relativistic boost. It can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m$ or $mc^2$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. From this, the momentum $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$. Since $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, it follows that $pc = (\\beta \\gamma) mc^2$. Therefore, the boost factor is $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n3.  **Final Formula:**\n    Combining all the parts, the mean decay distance in the lab frame is:\n    $L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot (c\\tau) = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_{X}^2 - (m_{X}c^2)^2}}{m_{X}c^2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}} \\right)$\n\n4.  **Executing the Calculation:**\n    First, let's gather the given values and ensure they are in consistent units. We will use Mega-electron-volts (MeV).\n    *   $E_{X} = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   We use the standard value for the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n    Let's compute the two main parts of the formula:\n    *   **Boost factor ($\\beta\\gamma$):**\n        $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000}}{1200} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200} \\approx 6.59124$\n    *   **Proper decay length ($c\\tau$):**\n        $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}} = \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 0.61665 \\text{ fm}$\n\n    Now, multiply these two results to get the lab-frame decay distance $L$:\n    $L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot (c\\tau) \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.61665 \\text{ fm} \\approx 4.0645 \\text{ fm}$\n\n    Finally, convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m):\n    $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Confirmation with Code:**\n    To ensure accuracy, the calculation was performed using the provided Python code interpreter.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given values in MeV\n    E_X_MeV = 8000.0\n    m_X_MeV = 1200.0\n    Gamma_X_MeV = 320.0\n\n    # Physical constant hbar*c in MeV*fm\n    hbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n    # Calculate pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)\n    pc_MeV = math.sqrt(E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_MeV**2)\n\n    # Calculate the boost factor p/m\n    boost_factor = pc_MeV / m_X_MeV\n\n    # Calculate the proper decay length c*tau\n    proper_decay_length_fm = hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV\n\n    # Calculate the lab decay distance in fm\n    lab_decay_distance_fm = boost_factor * proper_decay_length_fm\n\n    # Convert to meters\n    lab_decay_distance_m = lab_decay_distance_fm * 1e-15\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"{lab_decay_distance_m:.4e}\")\n    ```\n    The code output was `4.0645e-15`, which is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, confirming the manual calculation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated value is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n    Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n    B) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    C) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n    D) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\n    The result $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is closest to option C, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The minor discrepancy (around 0.02%) is likely due to slight rounding of the input values or constants in the problem statement or options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
