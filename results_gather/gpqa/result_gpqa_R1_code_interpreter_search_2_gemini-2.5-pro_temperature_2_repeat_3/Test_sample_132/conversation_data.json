    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System:**\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O). When dissolved in water, they dissociate as follows:\n*   KH2PO4 -> K+ + H2PO4-\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O -> 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O\n\nThe key species are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). These form a conjugate acid-base pair and constitute a buffer solution. The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid (H3PO4) are:\n\n*   (1) H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4-   (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n*   (2) H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n*   (3) HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\nOur solution is a buffer dominated by equilibrium (2). The concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) will be determined by equilibrium (3).\n\n**2. Calculate Molar Concentrations:**\nFirst, we calculate the moles of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- and then their concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n\n*   **For KH2PO4 (which provides H2PO4-):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **For Na2HPO4●2H2O (which provides HPO4^2-):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]:**\nThe [H+] concentration is controlled by the buffer equilibrium (2): H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-.\nThe acid dissociation constant expression is:\nKa2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]:**\nNow we use the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation (3): HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-.\nKa3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe use the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since Ka3 is very small, very little will dissociate) and the [H+] we just calculated.\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12 * 0.02809) / (8.11 x 10^-8)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.23 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\nTo get a more precise value, we will use a Python script for the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# 1. Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# 2. Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# 3. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]  =>  [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# 4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]  =>  [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# Assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration due to the small value of Ka3.\nconc_PO4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07 M\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:** The solution is created by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n    *   Therefore, the solution contains significant amounts of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which form a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\n2.  **Recognize the buffer system:** The presence of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) creates a buffer solution. The pH (and thus the H⁺ concentration) is determined by the equilibrium involving this pair, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n    *   Equilibrium 2: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations:** First, we need to find the number of moles of each phosphate species and then their concentration in the 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.200 L) solution.\n\n    *   **For H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):**\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = (Moles) / (Volume in L) = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L\n\n    *   **For HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):**\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = (Moles) / (Volume in L) = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L\n\n4.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:** We can use the Ka₂ expression for the buffer system to find the concentration of H⁺ ions.\n\n    *   Ka₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration:** The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n\n    *   Equilibrium 3: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n    *   We can use the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] calculated in step 3 and the [H⁺] concentration calculated in step 4. This is a valid assumption because Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning very little HPO₄²⁻ will actually dissociate to form PO₄³⁻.\n\n6.  **Perform calculations using Python:** To ensure accuracy, the above steps will be computed using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-]  =>  [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]  =>  [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# We assume the equilibrium concentration of [HPO4^2-] is approximately its initial concentration\n# due to the very small value of Ka3.\nconc_PO4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_HPO4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with options\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n\n```\nThe executed code returns the value `6.24e-07 M`, which corresponds to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.
