    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation Laws\n\nThe problem involves an electron-positron annihilation, which must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Electron (e⁻):** Moves from left to right (let's say the +x direction). Its Lorentz factor is `γ_e = 4`.\n*   **Positron (e⁺):** Moves from right to left (the -x direction). Its Lorentz factor is `γ_p = 2`.\n*   **Photons (γ₁ and γ₂):** Two photons are produced. They have equal energy and move in upper-right and lower-right directions.\n\nThe fundamental principles are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** `E_initial = E_final`\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `P_initial = P_final` (this is a vector equation)\n\n### 2. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum\n\nLet `m` be the rest mass of the electron (which is the same as the positron's rest mass) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Total Energy of a particle:** `E = γmc²`\n*   **Magnitude of Momentum of a particle:** `p = γmv`\n*   **Relation between energy and momentum:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²` which gives `p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c`. Alternatively, the relation `v/c = sqrt(γ² - 1) / γ` can be used to find `p = γm(c * sqrt(γ²-1)/γ) = mc*sqrt(γ²-1)`.\n\n**Electron (e⁻):**\n*   `γ_e = 4`\n*   Energy: `E_e = γ_e m c² = 4mc²`\n*   Momentum (in +x direction): `p_e = m c * sqrt(γ_e² - 1) = m c * sqrt(4² - 1) = m c * sqrt(15)`\n\n**Positron (e⁺):**\n*   `γ_p = 2`\n*   Energy: `E_p = γ_p m c² = 2mc²`\n*   Momentum (in -x direction): `p_p = m c * sqrt(γ_p² - 1) = m c * sqrt(2² - 1) = m c * sqrt(3)`\n\n**Total Initial State:**\n*   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):**\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):**\n    Momentum is a vector. Let the motion be along the x-axis.\n    `P_x_initial = p_e - p_p = mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))`\n    `P_y_initial = 0` (The collision is along the horizontal axis)\n\n### 3. Calculate Final Energy and Momentum\n\nThe final state consists of two photons. Photons have zero rest mass.\n*   Energy of a photon: `E_ph = p_ph * c`\n*   It's given that the two photons have the same energy, `E_ph1 = E_ph2 = E_ph`.\n\n**Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`6mc² = E_ph1 + E_ph2 = 2 * E_ph`\n`E_ph = 3mc²`\n\nThis is the energy of each of the two final photons.\n\n**Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe photons move upper-right (γ₁) and lower-right (γ₂). Let their directions make angles `θ` and `-θ` with the horizontal x-axis, respectively.\n\n*   **Momentum of Photon 1 (γ₁):**\n    `P_ph1 = ( (E_ph/c) * cos(θ), (E_ph/c) * sin(θ) )`\n*   **Momentum of Photon 2 (γ₂):**\n    `P_ph2 = ( (E_ph/c) * cos(-θ), (E_ph/c) * sin(-θ) ) = ( (E_ph/c) * cos(θ), -(E_ph/c) * sin(θ) )`\n\n**Total Final Momentum (`P_final`):**\n*   `P_x_final = (E_ph/c)cos(θ) + (E_ph/c)cos(θ) = 2(E_ph/c)cos(θ)`\n*   `P_y_final = (E_ph/c)sin(θ) - (E_ph/c)sin(θ) = 0`\n\nThe conservation of y-momentum is automatically satisfied (`P_y_initial = P_y_final = 0`). Now, we equate the x-components.\n\n`P_x_initial = P_x_final`\n`mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2(E_ph/c)cos(θ)`\n\nSubstitute the value `E_ph = 3mc²`:\n`mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2((3mc²)/c)cos(θ)`\n`mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2(3mc)cos(θ)`\n`mc(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6mc * cos(θ)`\n\nCancel `mc` from both sides:\n`sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Angle\n\nWe will now calculate the value of `θ` and the final angle between the photons.\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The question asks for the angle between the two photons.\n# The angles of the photons with the x-axis are theta and -theta.\n# So the angle between them is theta - (-theta) = 2*theta.\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"{angle_between_photons=}\")\n```\n>>>\nangle_between_photons=138.1788759367303\n>>>\nThe angle of the first photon is `θ ≈ 69.1°` with the horizontal axis. The angle of the second photon is `-θ ≈ -69.1°`.\nThe angle *between* the two photons is `θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n`Angle = 2 * 69.09° ≈ 138.18°`\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This problem requires the application of the conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic setting.\n\n**1. System State Before Collision (Initial State)**\n\nLet `m` be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron, and `c` be the speed of light.

System State After Annihilation (Final State)**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons. Let the energy of each photon be `E_ph`.

The core principles governing this interaction are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum vector before the collision must equal the total momentum vector after the collision.\n\n**2. Define the Initial State (Before Collision)**\n\nLet `m` be the rest mass of an electron (which is identical to the positron's rest mass) and `c` be the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Moves left-to-right (we'll define this as the +x direction).\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   Energy: `E_e = γ_e * mc² = 4mc²`.\n    *   Momentum: The magnitude is `p_e = mc√(γ_e² - 1) = mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15`.
