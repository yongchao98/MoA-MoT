    "To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X, we need to compare its mass with the masses of the possible decay products.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y) $$\nThis Lagrangian describes the coupling of the boson X to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). The relevant interaction term for the decay is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{decay} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y) $$\nThis term allows the boson X to decay into a fermion $f$ and its corresponding antifermion $\\bar{f}$, i.e., $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay process to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final particles. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$$ M_X \\geq m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ M_X \\geq 2m_f $$\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $M_X = 6$ GeV, we can find the maximum allowed mass for the fermion f:\n$$ m_f \\leq \\frac{M_X}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ GeV}}{2} = 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nTherefore, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the fermion is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\nLet's list the masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   Up (u): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n*   Down (d): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed.\n*   Strange (s): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed.\n*   Charm (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   Bottom (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed.\n*   Top (t): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed.\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   Electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_{\\mu} \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\text{ GeV} < 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed.\n\nSummarizing the allowed decay channels:\n*   Quarks: $u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}$\n*   Leptons: $e^{+}e^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n\nCombining these, the full list of kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order is:\n$X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nComparing this list with the given options:\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$)\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct)\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and excludes $c\\bar{c}$)\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and excludes $c\\bar{c}, \\mu^+\\mu^-$)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
