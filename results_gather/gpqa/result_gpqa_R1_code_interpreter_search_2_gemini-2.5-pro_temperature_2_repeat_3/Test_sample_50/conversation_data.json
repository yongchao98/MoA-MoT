    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at `V = 0`. When the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, it will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. The net potential energy of the system is the energy stored in the electric field created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method: The Method of Images**\n    This problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" This powerful technique allows us to replace a complex problem involving induced charges on a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges.\n    The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is identical to the field that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin (0,0,0).\n    *   Let the real charge `q` be on the x-axis at `x = d`.\n    *   We place the image charge `q'` also on the x-axis at `x = b`, where `b < R`.\n\n    The potential `V(P)` at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere must be zero. Let `P` be a point on the surface. The potential at `P` is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`:\n    `V(P) = k * q / r₁ + k * q' / r₂ = 0`\n    where `r₁` is the distance from `q` to `P` and `r₂` is the distance from `q'` to `P`.\n\n    By solving this equation for all points on the sphere, it can be shown that the image charge must be:\n    *   Magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Position: `b = R² / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U)**\n    There are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n    **Method A: Work Done to Assemble the System**\n    The potential energy `U` is equal to the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The external force must counteract the attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere (which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`).\n    *   Let the charge `q` be at a variable position `x` from the center (`x` goes from `∞` to `d`).\n    *   The force exerted by the sphere (i.e., by the image charge `q'`) on the charge `q` is:\n        `F_image = k * q * q' / (distance)²`\n        The position of the image charge `q'` is `b = R²/x`.\n        The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\n        `F_image(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n    *   This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`. The external force required to move the charge is `F_ext = -F_image`.\n    *   The work done (which is the potential energy `U`) is the integral of the external force from infinity to `d`:\n        `U = W_ext = ∫[from ∞ to d] F_ext dx = ∫[from ∞ to d] -F_image dx`\n        `U = ∫[from ∞ to d] [k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, we use u-substitution: Let `u = x² - R²`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = (k * q² * R / 2) ∫[from x=∞ to x=d] u⁻² du`\n        `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1/u] [from x=∞ to x=d]`\n        `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1 / (x² - R²)] [from x=∞ to x=d]`\n        `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d² - R²)) - (-1 / (∞² - R²))]`\n        `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1 / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    **Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula `U = (1/2)qV`**\n    The potential energy of interaction between a charge and a conductor can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor. The factor of `1/2` arises because the induced charge distribution is created by `q` itself.\n    *   Using the method of images, `V_induced` at position `d` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same position.\n    *   Potential at `d` due to `q'` at `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substitute the values for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R²/d) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n        `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    Both methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`. This matches option A. The energy is negative, which indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
