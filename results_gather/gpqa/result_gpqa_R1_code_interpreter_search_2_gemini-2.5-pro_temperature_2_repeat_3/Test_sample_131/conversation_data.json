    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both unknown compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 singlets in total.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is unsymmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-4 and C-6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-5) are all in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets**, each with an integration of 3H.\n    *   **Summary:** 6 singlets in total.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry that makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C-1 and C-4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C-2 and C-3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 singlets in total.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (4H) and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated immediately because the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options by combining the spectra of the individual compounds in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the observed spectrum of two signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This also does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Because the parent molecules are different, these two singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, we will see **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each 6H).\n        *   Total signals: We will see **three singlets** in total (assuming they have different chemical shifts).\n        *   Integration Ratio: The ratio of the protons in these signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
