    "**1. Analyze the Product Structure from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction using the provided NMR data. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. Since the reaction is a rearrangement, the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU, leaving 2 DoU for other features like rings or double bonds.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, likely a ketone or an aldehyde. Since it's a singlet (quaternary carbon), it must be a **ketone**. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): These are in the aliphatic region. Based on the ¹H NMR (see below), these correspond to two different **methyl (CH₃) groups**.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (δ 126-145). The pattern suggests a substituted benzene ring and a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d): This classic AA'BB' splitting pattern, with two doublets each integrating to 2 protons, is definitive evidence for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   δ 2.31 (3H, s) and δ 2.28 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. These are two **methyl (CH₃) groups** that are not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d): These are two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton. They are coupled to each other, which is characteristic of a **disubstituted alkene** (`-CH=CH-`). The large difference in chemical shifts suggests an electron-withdrawing group is attached to one end and an electron-donating group to the other. This accounts for the second degree of unsaturation (in addition to the ketone C=O and the benzene ring).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    Let's put the pieces together:\n    1.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One of the substituents is a methyl group (`-CH₃`), giving a **p-tolyl group**. This accounts for one of the methyl singlets (e.g., at δ 2.31).\n    3.  The other substituent is the rest of the molecule.\n    4.  The remaining fragments are: a ketone (`C=O`), a second methyl group (`-CH₃`), and a vinyl group (`-CH=CH-`).\n    5.  Let's combine these remaining fragments into a chain: `-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is a but-3-en-2-one chain.\n    6.  Attaching this chain to the p-tolyl group gives the final structure:\n        **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n        Structure: `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\n    This structure is fully consistent with the ¹H NMR data (p-tolyl group, trans-alkene protons, and acetyl methyl proton). The ¹³C data is also largely consistent, with the ketone at δ 197.7 and the two methyl carbons at δ 21.3 (tolyl-CH₃) and δ 28.4 (acetyl-CH₃).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) to form the unsaturated ketone identified above. This points to a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an isomer of the product. The options for Compound X are all vinyloxiranes (epoxides adjacent to a double bond). The rearrangement of a vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is a known chemical transformation.\n\nLet's evaluate the options to see which one could be Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not a p-tolyl group (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`). Since the product clearly contains a p-tolyl group, this cannot be the starting material, as the reaction conditions would not cause methylation of the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   It has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O).\n    *   It has a p-tolyl group, which is present in the product.\n    *   This is a terminal vinyloxirane. There is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement pathway for this class of compounds:\n        1.  The base (DABCO) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is the one on the epoxide carbon adjacent to the vinyl group (`-CH=CH-C**H**-O-`). This proton is activated by being both on a strained ring and allylic to a double bond.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion rearranges through an elimination mechanism (E1cB-type) to form an enolate (`p-Tol-CH=CH-C(O⁻)=CH₂`).\n        3.  Protonation of the enolate gives an enol, which tautomerizes to the stable methyl ketone.\n        `p-Tol-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` → `p-Tol-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n    This option provides the correct starting material that leads directly to the identified product through a plausible chemical mechanism.\n\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`. This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It also has an internal epoxide. Rearrangement of this structure would likely lead to an ethyl ketone (`-C(=O)CH₂CH₃`), which is inconsistent with the product's NMR data (two methyl singlets).\n\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This name is ambiguous, but commonly refers to C₁₀H₁₀O (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`), which has the wrong molecular formula.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe product of the reaction is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material among the options that has the correct formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains the necessary p-tolyl group is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Furthermore, there is a known base-catalyzed rearrangement that transforms this starting material into the observed product.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
