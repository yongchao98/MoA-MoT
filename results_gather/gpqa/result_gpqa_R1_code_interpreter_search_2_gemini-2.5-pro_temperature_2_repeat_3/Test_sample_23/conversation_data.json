    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`. Using approximate atomic masses Ar(H)≈1 and Ar(C)≈12, the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `14.28% = 0.1428`.  Notice that `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. So, we can set the fraction `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. For n=6, the formula C6H12 fits the CnH2n pattern.\n    *   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n        Mass of H = 12 * 1.008 = 12.096\n        Mass of C = 6 * 12.011 = 72.066\n        Total Mass = 84.162\n        Mass fraction of H = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. The data is consistent with Z being cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one* substance, Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that every component molecule in both mixture X and mixture Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton that, upon saturation with hydrogen, becomes cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the components of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Let the other component of Y be D.\n        *   D must have a C6 ring skeleton (from point 2).\n        *   D must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation (`D --(H2, Pt)--> C6H12`).\n        *   D must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   A saturated C6 ring is cyclohexane itself, but Y contains two *other* liquids (implying different from X). It is stated Y is an equimolar mixture of *two* liquids. If both were cyclohexane, it would be a pure substance, not a mixture.\n    *   The most plausible candidate for D is benzene (C6H6). Benzene has a six-carbon ring, does not decolorize bromine water, and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (`C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, heat, pressure)--> C6H12`).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One substance is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry of the reaction must be 1:1:1:1.\n        `1 A + 1 B -> 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H6`\n    *   Now, we can apply the law of conservation of atoms, specifically for hydrogen.\n    *   Let the formula for A be C6Hx (it has a C6 skeleton) and the formula for B be C6Hy (it also has a C6 skeleton).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms on the reactant side is `x + y`.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms on the product side is `12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms: `x + y = 18`.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B.\n    *   This sum is precisely `x + y`.\n    *   From our analysis, `x + y = 18`.\n\n6.  **Final Consistency Check**\n    *   The compounds in mixture X must decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). They also have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Can we find A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy) such that `x+y=18` and they meet the criteria?\n    *   Consider cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   `x = 10`, `y = 8`.  `x + y = 10 + 8 = 18`. This works.\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one C=C bond (no conjugation).\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated C=C bonds (not conjugated).\n        *   In the disproportionation reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H6 + C6H12`, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is reduced by gaining 4H, and the cyclohexene is oxidized by losing 4H. This is a plausible reaction.\n    *   All conditions are met. The logic is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
