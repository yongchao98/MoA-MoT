    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, L1 / L2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   `R` is the star's radius.\n    *   `T` is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `π` (pi) is a mathematical constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:** To find the ratio L1 / L2, we can divide the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information for Radius:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    So, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    We can calculate the first part of our equation:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Information for Temperature:** This is the most complex part. We need to find the ratio of the temperatures, T₁/T₂.\n    *   We are told the stars *appear* brightest at the same wavelength. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_max_obs). So, λ_max_obs₁ = λ_max_obs₂.\n    *   A star's temperature is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength (λ_max_emitted) by Wien's Displacement Law: T = b / λ_max_emitted, where `b` is Wien's constant. This means temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength: T₁/T₂ = λ_max_emitted₂ / λ_max_emitted₁.\n    *   The observed wavelength can be different from the emitted wavelength due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's radial velocity (v_r). For non-relativistic speeds (where v << c), the relationship is: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c). A positive `v_r` indicates the star is moving away (redshift), and a negative `v_r` indicates it's moving closer (blueshift).\n\n6.  **Apply the Doppler Effect to Find Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity v_r₁ = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift. Therefore, the observed peak wavelength is equal to the emitted peak wavelength: λ_max_obs₁ = λ_max_emitted₁.\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity v_r₂ = 700 km/s. The star is moving away, causing a redshift. The observed peak wavelength is longer than the emitted one: λ_max_obs₂ = λ_max_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c), where c is the speed of light (~3.00 x 10⁵ km/s).\n    *   **Combine the information:** We know λ_max_obs₁ = λ_max_obs₂. Substituting the expressions from above, we get:\n        λ_max_emitted₁ = λ_max_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   **Find the ratio for the temperature calculation:** We need the ratio λ_max_emitted₂ / λ_max_emitted₁. Rearranging the equation above gives:\n        λ_max_emitted₂ / λ_max_emitted₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n    *   Since T₁/T₂ = λ_max_emitted₂ / λ_max_emitted₁, we have:\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now, substitute all the parts back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L1 / L2 = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** Plug in the values for v_r₂ (700 km/s) and c (3.00 x 10⁵ km/s).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Ratio of radii (R1/R2)\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Radial velocity of Star 2 in km/s\nv_r2 = 700.0\n\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 3.0e5\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Calculate the squared ratio of the radii\nR_ratio_squared = radius_ratio ** 2\n\n# 2. Calculate the ratio of the temperatures.\n# Due to the Doppler effect, T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\ndoppler_factor = 1 + v_r2 / c\nT_ratio = 1 / doppler_factor\n\n# 3. Calculate the fourth power of the temperature ratio\nT_ratio_to_the_fourth = T_ratio ** 4\n\n# 4. Calculate the final luminosity ratio: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = R_ratio_squared * T_ratio_to_the_fourth\n\nprint(f\"{luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.2292\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.2292, which rounds to 2.23.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars, L₁ / L₂.\n\n2.  **Recall the Governing Physics Principle:** The problem states to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a black-body radiator is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    Where:\n    *   `L` is the luminosity.\n    *   `R` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `T` is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio Equation:** To find the ratio of luminosities, we divide the equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants `4π` and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Analyze the Radius Information:** The problem explicitly gives the relationship between the radii:\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   Squaring this ratio gives: (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Temperature Information:** This requires multiple steps.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body is inversely related to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted): T = b / λ_emitted, where `b` is Wien's constant. This implies that the ratio of temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their emitted peak wavelengths:\n        T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) can differ from the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) due to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The relationship is given by:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n        where `c` is the speed of light. A positive velocity means the object is receding (redshift), and a negative velocity means it is approaching (blueshift).\n    *   **Applying the Doppler Effect to Both Stars:**\n        *   **Star_1:** v_r₁ = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift. Thus, λ_obs₁ = λ_emitted₁.\n        *   **Star_2:** v_r₂ = 700 km/s. This star is receding, so its light is redshifted. Thus, λ_obs₂ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c).\n    *   **Connecting the Information:** The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂. We can substitute the expressions from the Doppler effect analysis:\n        λ_emitted₁ = λ_emitted₂ * (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We need the ratio λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ to find T₁/T₂. Rearranging the equation above:\n        λ_emitted₂ / λ_emitted₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)\n        Therefore, T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c).\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Luminosity Ratio Equation:** Now, substitute the expressions for the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the main luminosity ratio formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r₂ / c)]⁴\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Result:** We plug in the given values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 3.0 x 10⁵ km/s (the speed of light)\n    *   (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 700 / 300000)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333...)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    The python script previously computed this value to be approximately 2.2291.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nOur calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
