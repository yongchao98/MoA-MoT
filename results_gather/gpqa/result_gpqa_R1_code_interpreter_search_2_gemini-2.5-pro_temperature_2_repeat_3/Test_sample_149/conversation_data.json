    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound C8H9NO from its NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DU):**\n        The formula is C8H9NO.\n        The DU = C + 1 + N/2 – H/2 = 8 + 1 + 1/2 – 9/2 = 9 – 4 = 5.\n        A DU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DU=4) and one double bond (e.g., C=O), which is consistent with the proposed structure.\n\n    2.  **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This points to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde group. It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). The chemical shift is downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the aldehyde and the attached aromatic ring. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is typical for an amino group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to broad signals.\n\n    3.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO). Assembling these parts gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n        The starting material is:\n         \n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n    1.  **Reagents: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The reaction is performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n        The product is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n        `NH2-C6H4-CH2CHO -> [Cl-][N2+]-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n    2.  **Reagent: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Adding water and warming the solution of the diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N2). This is a standard synthesis of phenols from anilines.\n        The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        `[N2+]-C6H4-CH2CHO -> HO-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n    3.  **Reagents: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic protons on the alpha-carbon (the -CH2- group). These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n        *   **Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate ion: `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]-`. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Subsequent protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the aldol addition product.\n            Adduct: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n            The IUPAC name of this adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**, which corresponds to option **(C)**.\n\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heating the aldol adduct in the presence of base promotes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The -OH group from the beta-carbon (C3) and a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2) are eliminated. The C2 proton is particularly acidic as it's alpha to the carbonyl group.\n            Adduct: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-C6H4-OH`\n            Final Product: `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO + H2O`\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\n    The structure of the final condensation product is `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`. Let's name this molecule using IUPAC rules.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at C2. So, the parent name is **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a **4-hydroxyphenyl** substituent on carbon C2.\n    *   There is a **4-hydroxyphenyl** substituent on carbon C4.\n    *   Combining these, the name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option **(A)**.\n\nSince the reaction conditions include heat and the question asks for the **final product**, the condensation product (A) is the expected outcome, not the intermediate aldol adduct (C).\n\nFinal Check:\n*   Option A: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. Matches our derived final product.\n*   Option B: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Incorrect substituents (phenyl vs. hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n*   Option C: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final condensation product expected with heat.\n*   Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. This is a monomer, not a dimerization product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
