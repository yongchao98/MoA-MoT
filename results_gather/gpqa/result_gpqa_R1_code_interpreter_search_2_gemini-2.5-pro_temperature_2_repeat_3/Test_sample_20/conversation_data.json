    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is an equilibrium between two isomers, called tautomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one α-hydrogen (an alpha-hydrogen). An α-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an α-carbon (alpha-carbon), which is the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The α-carbon should generally be sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. Its systematic name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons relative to the two carbonyl groups (at C1 and C4).\n    *   For the C1=O group, the α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   For the C4=O group, the α-carbons are C3 and C5.\n    *   In the structure of benzoquinone, carbons C2, C3, C5, and C6 are all part of carbon-carbon double bonds; they are sp² hybridized.\n    *   For keto-enol tautomerism to occur, a proton needs to be removed from an α-carbon. In benzoquinone, the α-carbons do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. The hydrogens are attached to these sp² carbons, but they are vinylic hydrogens, not the typical α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon. These vinylic C-H bonds are stronger and less acidic. A tautomerization would disrupt the conjugated system without the significant stabilizing benefit of forming an aromatic ring. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons that are not part of the carbonyl groups (C2, C4, C6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons. For each of the three C=O groups, the two adjacent carbons are α-carbons. For example, for the C1=O group, the α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   These α-carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms (α-hydrogens).\n    *   Because it possesses α-hydrogens, this molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. A proton from an α-carbon (e.g., C2) can migrate to the oxygen of an adjacent carbonyl group (e.g., C1=O), forming a C=C double bond and an alcohol (-OH) group.\n    *   In fact, this molecule can undergo three such tautomerizations to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is aromatic, which makes it extremely stable. The equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form.\n    *   Since it can exist in interconvertible keto and enol forms, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Let's draw the structure. It is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid).\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n              OH\n              |\n        CH₃ - CH - C(=O)-O-CH₃\n        ```\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (C2). It is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   All four of these groups are different. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n              H      COOCH₃\n               \\    /\n                C==C\n               /    \\\n         CH₃OOC      H\n        ```\n    *   The molecule is planar. It contains a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The carbons of the double bond are sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups each.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this to the options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
