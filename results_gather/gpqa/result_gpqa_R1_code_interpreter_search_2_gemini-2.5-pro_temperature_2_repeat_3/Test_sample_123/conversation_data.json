    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` in their own rest frame (proper time) is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** For particles moving at a relativistic speed `v`, their internal clocks run slower as observed from the lab frame. This effect is described by the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is dilated:\n    `t_lab = γ * τ`\n    The decay formula, from the lab's perspective, over a time `t_travel` (lab time) is:\n    `N(t_travel) = N₀ * exp(-t_travel / (γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center of the detector to the inner wall, a distance `R = 30 m`. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time taken to reach the wall in the lab frame is:\n    `t_travel = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Survival Probability:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is `N / N₀`. Substituting `t_travel` into the decay equation gives the survival probability:\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    `N / N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * cτ))`\n    The term `cτ` is the mean distance a particle would travel in its rest frame during one proper lifetime.\n\n5.  **Applying to Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Radius, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles, `N / N₀ = 1/3`.\n\n    Plugging these values into the survival probability equation:\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Applying to Scenario 2:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   Radius, `R = 30 m`.\n    *   Fraction of surviving particles, `N / N₀ = 2/3`.\n\n    Plugging these values into the survival probability equation:\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\n    Again, taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for `γ₂`:**\n    We have two equations and two unknowns (`γ₂` and `cτ`). We can solve this system. Let's isolate the constant term `30 / (cτ)` in both equations.\n\n    From Equation 1: `30 / (cτ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    From Equation 2: `30 / (cτ) = γ₂ * ln(1.5)`\n\n    Now, we can set the right-hand sides equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Finally, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor, gamma_2.\n# gamma_2 = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18956973339129\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation yields approximately `54.19`.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is `~54.19`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 68\n    C) 40\n    D) 28\n\n    The closest option is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem describes two scenarios involving the decay of ultra-relativistic particles within a spherical detector. We can solve this by setting up equations for each scenario based on the principles of special relativity and particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame is given by `N = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `t_dilated` is the time-dilated mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame (`t_dilated`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, `τ`) due to its high speed. This is given by `t_dilated = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for a particle to travel the radius `R` of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\nCombining these, the fraction of particles `(N / N₀)` that reach the detector wall is:\n`N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n**2. Set up Equations for Both Scenarios**\n\nLet `R = 30 m`. The term `c * τ` is the mean decay length in the particle's rest frame, which is a constant for this type of particle.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of survivors, `N₁ / N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   The equation is: `1/3 = exp(-R / (γ₁ * cτ)) = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    *   ` -ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    *   `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`.\n    *   Fraction of survivors, `N₂ / N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   The equation is: `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * cτ)) = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    *   `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    *   `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n**3. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂) **\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for `γ₂` by eliminating the unknown constant `cτ`.\n\nFrom Equation 1, rearrange to solve for `cτ`:\n`cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\nSubstitute this expression for `cτ` into Equation 2:\n`ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n`ln(1.5) = (30 * ln(3)) / (γ₂ * 1.5)`\n`ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the natural logarithm values (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nFinal check with the Python interpreter output: The calculation yielded `~54.19`, confirming the result.\n\nThe Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
