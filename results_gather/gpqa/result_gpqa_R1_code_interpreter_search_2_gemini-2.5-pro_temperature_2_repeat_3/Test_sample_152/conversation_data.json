These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate. The α-hydrogens located between the two ester groups are acidic. The strong base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) will deprotonate the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the α-carbon and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   This conjugate addition breaks the carbon-carbon double bond. The electrons from the double bond move to the α-carbon, and then the carbonyl pi-electrons move to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) during workup to yield the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `CH(COOMe)₂` adds to the β-carbon, and the α-carbon gets protonated.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(MeOOC)₂CH–CH(p-Tolyl)–CH₂–COOMe`\n\n4.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   To name this molecule systemically, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups. This is a propane chain substituted with three methyl carboxylate groups.\n    *   Let's use the IUPAC naming convention seen in the options. Consider a `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` backbone. The structure is `(HOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂(COOH)`. The corresponding trimethyl ester is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH₂-CH₂(COOMe)`.\n    *   Our product has a p-tolyl group. Looking at the structure `(MeOOC)₂CH–CH(p-Tolyl)–CH₂–COOMe`, the p-tolyl group is on the central carbon (C2) of this three-carbon chain.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral enol equivalent. The carbon β to the nitrogen (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is nucleophilic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   This forms a new C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate and a resonance-stabilized carbanion (anion at the α-carbon to the nitrile).\n    *   The carbanion is protonated (likely by MeOH).\n    *   Finally, the addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The net result is the alkylation of the original ketone (cyclohexanone) at the α-position.\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile that is added is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is cyclohexanone substituted at the C2 position with this group: `2-[-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN]cyclohexan-1-one`.\n\n4.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   We can name this compound as a substituted butanenitrile. The parent chain is butanenitrile (`N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(substituent)-C⁴H₃`).\n    *   The substituent is on C3. The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring, attached at its C2 position. This group is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Thus, the name of product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, describes the enol tautomer. In standard conditions with an acidic workup, the keto form is the major, more stable product.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   We are given the product and need to find the reactant C. This is a Michael addition.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at the C2 position with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), has the structure `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`. In a Michael addition, it adds as the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` fragment. This matches the substituent in the product.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant C (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile's active carbon and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   Since the `(3-oxobutyl)` group from MVK is attached to C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   The C2 methylene hydrogens of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are very acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) easily removes one of these protons to form a stable enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   Product **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   Reactant **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nThis combination matches all the components listed in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
