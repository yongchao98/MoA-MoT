    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the bonds in the molecule.**\n\nThe chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. We need to parse this condensed formula to determine the molecular formula (CxHy) and the types and number of bonds.\n\nThe structure can be broken down as follows:\n- (CH3)2C= : A carbon atom with two methyl (CH3) groups, double-bonded to the next carbon.\n- =CH- : A carbon atom with one hydrogen, participating in one double and one single bond.\n- -CH2- : A carbon atom with two hydrogens.\n- -CH(CH3)- : A carbon atom with one hydrogen and one methyl group.\n- -CH2- : Another carbon atom with two hydrogens.\n- -CH= : A carbon atom with one hydrogen, participating in one single and one double bond.\n- =C(CH3)2 : A carbon atom with two methyl groups, double-bonded to the previous carbon.\n\nLet's count the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n- Carbons: 2 (from the first two CH3) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH-) + 1 (from the middle CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from the last two CH3) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n- Hydrogens: 6 (from first two CH3) + 1 (=CH-) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH-) + 3 (from middle CH3) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 6 (from last two CH3) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n- **C-H bonds:** The count is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n- **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by '=' in the formula: one in (CH3)2**C=C**H- and one in -CH**=C**(CH3)2. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n- **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    - Two bonds connecting the first two CH3 groups to the main chain.\n    - The bond between =CH- and -CH2-.\n    - The bond between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-.\n    - The bond connecting the middle CH3 group.\n    - The bond between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-.\n    - The bond between -CH2- and -CH=.\n    - Two bonds connecting the last two CH3 groups to the main chain.\n    - Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nTo verify, the sum of valencies must be satisfied. Total valency contributed by atoms = (12 C * 4) + (22 H * 1) = 48 + 22 = 70. Total bonds = (9 C-C * 2) + (2 C=C * 4) + (22 C-H * 2) = 18 + 8 + 44 = 70. The bond count is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization for the constituent elements.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the enthalpy change for atomizing the reactants:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nThe enthalpy change (ΔH_atomization) is:\nΔH_atomization = [12 × ΔH_at(C)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]\nGiven:\nΔH_at(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\nBE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization = (12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 mol × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule.**\n\nThe total bond energy (ΣBE) is the sum of the energies of all bonds in one mole of the molecule C12H22.\nΣBE = [9 × BE(C-C)] + [2 × BE(C=C)] + [22 × BE(C-H)]\n\nGiven:\nBE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\nBE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nBE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΣBE = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΣBE = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the molecule.**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the molecule from its gaseous atoms.\nΔHf = ΔH_atomization - ΣBE\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Check the options and units.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy, not ΔHf)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option A or B. The number in option D matches, but the unit is kJ/g, not kJ/mol. This is likely a typo in the option.\n\nLet's check option C by converting our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. To do this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\nUsing integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol), which is appropriate given the rounded numbers for energies:\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option C exactly.\n\n```python\n# Given data\ndH_at_C = 1000  # kJ/mol, Enthalpy of atomization of carbon\nBE_HH = 100     # kJ/mol, Bond energy of H-H\nBE_CC = 200     # kJ/mol, Bond energy of C-C\nBE_C_eq_C = 300 # kJ/mol, Bond energy of C=C\nBE_CH = 400     # kJ/mol, Bond energy of C-H\n\n# Molecular formula is C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Number of H2 molecules needed is half the number of H atoms\nnum_H2 = num_H / 2\n\n# Number of bonds in the molecule\nnum_CC = 9\nnum_C_eq_C = 2\nnum_CH = 22\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy required to atomize the reactants (12 C(s) and 11 H2(g))\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C * dH_at_C) + (num_H2 * BE_HH)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule C12H22\n# This represents the energy released when the molecule is formed from gaseous atoms\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CC * BE_CC) + (num_C_eq_C * BE_C_eq_C) + (num_CH * BE_CH)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (in kJ/mol)\n# ΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\ndHf_per_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the molar mass of C12H22 using integer atomic weights\n# M(C)=12 g/mol, M(H)=1 g/mol\nmolar_mass = num_C * 12 + num_H * 1\n\n# Step 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\ndHf_per_gram = dHf_per_mol / molar_mass\n\n# Print the results to verify\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {dHf_per_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass (g/mol): {molar_mass}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {dHf_per_gram}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following formula:\n\n**ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of constituent elements] - [Total bond energy of the molecule]**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the number of each type of bond.**\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\nLet's find the molecular formula (CxHy):\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 12\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by \"=\". So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms in the chain and the branches:\n    *   2 bonds for the first (CH3)2C- group.\n    *   1 bond for =CH-CH2-\n    *   1 bond for -CH2-CH(CH3)-\n    *   1 bond for the -CH(CH3)- branch.\n    *   1 bond for -CH(CH3)-CH2-\n    *   1 bond for -CH2-CH=\n    *   2 bonds for the last =C(CH3)2 group.\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization for the constituent elements.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need the enthalpy required to break the elements into gaseous atoms:\n*   12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n*   11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nEnthalpy of atomization = [12 × ΔH_at(C)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]\nGiven:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (ΔH_at(C)) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H (BE(H-H)) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nEnthalpy of atomization = (12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 mol × 100 kJ/mol)\n= 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the molecule.**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the molecule is formed from its gaseous atoms. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\nTotal bond energy = [9 × BE(C-C)] + [2 × BE(C=C)] + [22 × BE(C-H)]\nGiven:\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond energy = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\n= 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol.**\n\nΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization] - [Total bond energy]\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation to the units in the options.**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol, which does not match options A or B directly. Option D has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Let's convert our answer to kJ/g and check against option C.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses as the problem uses round numbers for energies):\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
