    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100% to 32%, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This characteristic M+ / M+2 peak ratio of ~3:1 is a definitive indicator of a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   We can calculate the molecular formula contribution from C₇H₅O₂: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 32 = 121.\n    *   With ³⁵Cl: 121 + 35 = 156. This matches the M+ peak.\n    *   With ³⁷Cl: 121 + 37 = 158. This matches the M+2 peak.\n    *   So, the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options have this formula.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The wide range is due to the strong dimeric hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence eliminates option **(D) Phenyl chloroformate**, which lacks an O-H group, and makes options **(A)** and **(B)** more likely than **(C)**, as the IR signature for a carboxylic acid is very distinct.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is almost always due to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Splitting:** It is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons, which is expected for a -COOH proton.\n    *   **Integration:** It represents one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   There are two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet representing two equivalent protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet representing two other equivalent protons.\n    *   **Pattern:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a *para* (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent. Each set of protons is split by its neighbor, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Putting It All Together & Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   The evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **(A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a benzoic acid (fits IR and NMR acid proton) with a chlorine atom at the para position. The para-substitution pattern perfectly matches the two doublets seen in the ¹H NMR. The molecular weight and presence of chlorine match the MS data. This is a perfect match.\n*   **(B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It would have 4 non-equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **(C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** While having the correct formula, it is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm or the extremely broad IR peak. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would show 3 distinct signals.\n*   **(D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Does not have a carboxylic acid group, failing to match the IR and NMR data for the acidic proton.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only structure consistent with all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
