    "An electron's spin state can be described by a two-component column vector called a spinor. In this problem, the unnormalized spin state is given by:\n$|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe spin operator along the y-direction, $S_y$, is defined as:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $\\sigma_y$ is the Pauli Y-matrix:\n$\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe expectation value of an operator $A$ for a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n$\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}$\n\nHere, $A = S_y$ and $|\\psi\\rangle = |\\chi\\rangle$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the ket vector $|\\chi\\rangle$ acted upon by the operator $S_y$**:\n    $S_y |\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $S_y |\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $S_y |\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Since $i^2 = -1$, we have:\n    $S_y |\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Determine the bra vector $\\langle\\chi|$**:\n    The bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector.\n    For $|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$, the transpose is $\\begin{pmatrix} 3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The complex conjugate of the transpose is:\n    $\\langle\\chi| = \\begin{pmatrix} (3i)^* & 4^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the numerator $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle$**:\n    $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]$\n    $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12i^2 - 12]$\n    $\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-12 - 12] = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}(-24) = -12\\hbar$\n\n4.  **Calculate the denominator (the normalization factor squared) $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle$**:\n    $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)$\n    $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = -9i^2 + 16$\n    $\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle = 9 + 16 = 25$\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle S_y \\rangle$**:\n    $\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\chi|S_y|\\chi\\rangle}{\\langle\\chi|\\chi\\rangle} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 25*hbar/2\nB) -25*hbar/2\nC) -12*hbar/25\nD) 12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated expectation value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
