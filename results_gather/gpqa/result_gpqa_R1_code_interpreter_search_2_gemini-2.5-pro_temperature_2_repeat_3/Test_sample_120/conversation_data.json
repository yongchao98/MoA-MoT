    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring that is part of a bicyclic system with an epoxide.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a 6-membered ring and a 3-membered ring sharing two atoms (bridgehead carbons). The `7-oxa` part means the single-atom bridge is an oxygen, which confirms this is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. In this reaction, it acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, effectively Me⁻.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Regioselectivity of the Attack\nThe problem states a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is characteristic of an SN2-type reaction mechanism.\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group in addition to the ring carbons C2 and C6. This makes C1 a tertiary carbon.\n*   Carbon C6 is only connected to ring carbons C1 and C5, and a hydrogen atom. This makes C6 a secondary carbon.\n*   Comparing the steric hindrance, C6 is less hindered than C1.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n### 3. Stereochemistry of the Reaction\nThe problem provides another crucial piece of information: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This confirms the reaction proceeds via an **SN2 mechanism**, which involves backside attack.\n*   The initial configuration of the carbon being attacked (C6) is given as **S**.\n*   The SN2 attack causes an inversion of stereochemistry at this center.\n*   Therefore, the configuration of the stereocenter at C6 in the product will be **R**.\n\nStereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction will retain their configuration.\n*   C1 has an initial configuration of **R**. No bonds to this stereocenter are broken. Thus, its configuration remains **R**.\n*   C3 has an initial configuration of **R**. It is not part of the reaction site. Its configuration remains **R**.\n*   C4 has an initial configuration of **R**. It is not part of the reaction site. Its configuration remains **R**.\n\n### 4. Structure and Naming of the Product\nThe reaction opens the epoxide ring to form a cyclohexanol derivative.\n1.  **Attack:** Me⁻ attacks C6.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen, still attached to C1, becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n3.  **Work-up:** A proton source (e.g., H₃O⁺, typically added after the initial reaction) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\nThe final product has the following substituents on the cyclohexane ring (using the reactant's numbering for now):\n*   On C1: an -OH group and the original -Me group.\n*   On C3: the original -Me group.\n*   On C4: the original -Me group.\n*   On C6: the newly added -Me group from the cuprate.\n\nTo get the correct IUPAC name, we must re-number the ring according to IUPAC rules for substituted cyclohexanols:\n*   The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents (the four methyl groups).\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:**\n        *   New C1 (old C1): Methyl group\n        *   New C2 (old C6): Methyl group\n        *   New C3 (old C5): No substituent\n        *   New C4 (old C4): Methyl group\n        *   New C5 (old C3): Methyl group\n        *   This gives methyl locants of {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:**\n        *   New C1 (old C1): Methyl group\n        *   New C6 (old C2): No substituent\n        *   New C5 (old C3): Methyl group\n        *   New C4 (old C4): Methyl group\n        *   New C3 (old C5): No substituent\n        *   New C2 (old C6): Methyl group\n        *   This would lead to locants {1, 3, 4, 6} by numbering in the other direction (new C3 is old C3). To be systematic: C1(Me), C2(no), C3(Me), C4(Me), C5(no), C6(Me). Locants are {1,3,4,6}.\n*   Comparing the locant sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {1, 3, 4, 6}, the former is lower (comparing the first point of difference, 2 < 3).\n*   Thus, the correct IUPAC name for the product's structure is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n### 5. Final Stereochemistry of the Product\nNow we combine the stereochemical analysis with the IUPAC name.\n*   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted from S to **R**.\n*   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n\nPutting it all together, the stereochemistry of the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
