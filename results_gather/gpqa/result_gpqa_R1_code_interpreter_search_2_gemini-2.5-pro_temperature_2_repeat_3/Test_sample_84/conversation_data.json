    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    So, the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The radial velocity (RV) method provides information about the star's velocity induced by the planet's gravity. The maximum induced velocity, or RV semi-amplitude (K), is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    where `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), and assuming the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90° (a valid assumption since the planets were also detected by the transit method), the RV semi-amplitude K is also related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (`a`):\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the above equation to solve for `a`:\n    K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio a2 / a1 using the expression for `a`:\n    a1 ≈ (M_p1^2 * G) / (K1^2 * M_star)\n    a2 ≈ (M_p2^2 * G) / (K2^2 * M_star)\n\n    a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (K1^2 * M_star)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n7.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n        M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n        (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** This is proportional to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        (K1 / K2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute and Solve for a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Final Numerical Value:** To compare with the options, let's calculate the decimal value.\n```python\n# Given values\n# Masses\nMp2_over_Mp1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Doppler shifts -> Proportional to RV semi-amplitude K\nK1_over_K2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (Mp2_over_Mp1)**2 * (K1_over_K2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_ratio = a2_over_a1**0.5\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio=}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nT_ratio=0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} (1-A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\nSince both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo (A is the same for both), these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1-A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} (1-A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nSo, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the star's velocity variation. For a circular orbit and assuming the system is viewed edge-on (inclination i=90°, which is a reasonable assumption given the planets are also detected by transits), the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}^2} \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow we can form the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{M_{p2}^2 G}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{M_{p1}^2 G}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n\nThe terms G and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nGiven values:\n*   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratios:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^2 (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
