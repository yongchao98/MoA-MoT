    "This is a particle physics problem that involves the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Process:**\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). This process converts their rest mass into energy, which then creates new particles. The reaction is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State:**\n*   **Particles:** We start with one proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. We can, therefore, assume the annihilation happens \"at rest.\"\n*   **Total Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The total energy in the initial state is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_i$):** Since the particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State:**\n*   **Particles:** The annihilation produces four particles in the final state: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. According to the given information, they all have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the four A particles must fly away from the annihilation point in such a way that their vector sum of momenta cancels out.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy ($E_i$) must be equal to the total final energy ($E_f$). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the problem (zero initial momentum and identical product particles), we can assume that the total energy is distributed equally among the four final particles. They will all have the same speed, $v$.\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. The Calculation:**\nWe will now use the principle of energy conservation ($E_i = E_f$) to find the velocity.\n\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n*   $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe calculation for $\\gamma$ and the subsequent velocity is performed using the following code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# According to energy conservation: E_initial = E_final\n# E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2 (Annihilation from rest)\n# E_final = 4 * E_A = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# So, 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now, solve for the velocity (v) from the definition of gamma.\n# beta = v/c\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - beta^2)\n# 1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma^2\n# beta^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - (1 / gamma^2))\n\nbeta = np.sqrt(1 - (1 / gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nExecution successful:\n```\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n```\nThe calculation shows that the velocity of particle A is 0.77 times the speed of light, c.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to a particle-antiparticle annihilation process. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Conservation Laws:** The fundamental laws governing this process are the conservation of total energy and total momentum.\n2.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The system initially consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The prompt states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a standard simplification implying that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can, therefore, assume the annihilation happens \"at rest.\"\n    *   **Initial Momentum:** With the system at rest, the total initial momentum is zero ($P_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. Protons and antiprotons have identical mass. The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n        $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n        $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All four have the same rest mass $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):** Due to momentum conservation, the total final momentum must also be zero. To achieve this, the four particles must fly off in directions such that their momentum vectors cancel out.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic total energies of the four resulting particles.\n        $E_{particle} = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Because momentum must be conserved (starting from zero) and the final particles have identical mass, the energy will be distributed equally among them. This means they all will have the same kinetic energy and thus the same speed, $v$.\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Applying Energy Conservation:**\n    *   We set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n5.  **Solving for Velocity:**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Next, we solve for the velocity, $v$. We use the definition of the Lorentz factor and solve for $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   This calculation is best done with a short script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the rest energies in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Proton rest energy\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Particle A rest energy\n\n# Conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c^2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c^2\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from the definition of gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - (1 / (gamma**2)))\n\n# The velocity is v = beta * c. The question asks for this velocity,\n# and the options are given as multiples of c.\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nExecution successful:\n```\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n```\nThe calculated value for the velocity is approximately 0.77c. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
