    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Model\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This oscillating charge acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nIn physics, the radiation from a localized, oscillating source is described by a multipole expansion. The lowest order and typically dominant term in this expansion is the **electric dipole radiation**, unless it is forbidden by some symmetry. An oscillating charge distribution generally possesses a time-varying electric dipole moment.\n\nA simple model for this system is an electric dipole `p(t)` oscillating along the z-axis. The problem statement does not provide any information to suggest that the electric dipole moment is zero (which would require a specific type of symmetric oscillation, like a purely shape-based oscillation). Therefore, the most reasonable and standard physical model to apply is that of an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the far-field (radiation zone) is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n*   `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` mentioned in the problem is this `dP/dΩ`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or π/2 radians), i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * (1)² = C`.\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n\n`P(30°) = (dP/dΩ)_at_30° = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n`P(30°) = C * (1/2)² = C/4`\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is the ratio `P(30°) / A`:\n\n`Fraction = P(30°) / A = (C/4) / C = 1/4`\n\n### 3. Analyze the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nNow, we need to find the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle for an electric dipole is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillation. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by:\n\n`ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`\n\nFrom the formula for `dP/dΩ`, we can see that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSubstituting the relation for `ω` in terms of `λ`:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is also famously known from Rayleigh scattering, which is caused by the dipole radiation of light from particles much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n\n### 4. Combine the Results\n\nBased on our analysis:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  A possible form for the function `f` shows a dependence on wavelength as **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 1/4, λ⁻³\nB) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nC) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nD) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n**(Self-Correction/Alternative Check):** If we were to assume a higher-order radiation, like an electric quadrupole (which could arise from the spheroid changing shape), the power dependence would be `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and the wavelength dependence would be `λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of `3/4` and a `λ⁻⁶` dependence (Option B). However, without specific constraints forbidding dipole radiation, it is assumed to be the dominant form of radiation. Thus, the dipole model is the most appropriate choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
