    "*   **1. Understand the Physics Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the inherent uncertainty in its energy. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n*   **2. State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle is mathematically expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n*   **3. Relate Lifetime to Time Uncertainty:** The lifetime (τ) of a quantum state is the time interval over which it exists. We can approximate the uncertainty in time (Δt) with the lifetime (τ). A more common and practical relation used in this context is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This value, ΔE, is often referred to as the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. It represents the \"fuzziness\" or spread of the energy level due to its finite lifetime.\n\n*   **4. Define the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). If the energy separation is smaller than this sum, the energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n    Condition for resolution: |E₁ - E₂| ≥ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n*   **5. Calculate the Energy Uncertainties:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s):\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For state 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **6. Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    *   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| = (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Minimum |E₁ - E₂| ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **7. Compare with the Given Options:** The energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV to be resolvable. Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV < 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV < 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV (**Resolvable**)\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy separation to clearly distinguish the two states is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n```python\n# The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy (Delta_E) and\n# the lifetime (tau) of a state by Delta_E * tau ~ h_bar (reduced Planck's constant).\n# Therefore, the energy width or uncertainty of a state is Delta_E ~ h_bar / tau.\n\n# To clearly resolve two energy levels, E1 and E2, their energy difference\n# must be at least as large as the sum of their individual energy widths.\n# |E1 - E2| >= Delta_E1 + Delta_E2\n\n# Constants\n# h_bar in eV.s (electron-volt-seconds)\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds for state 1\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds for state 2\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference for resolution: {min_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Now we check which of the options is greater than this minimum required difference.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-11,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > min_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {key}: {value:.1e} eV is large enough to be resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key}: {value:.1e} eV is NOT large enough to be resolved.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>",
