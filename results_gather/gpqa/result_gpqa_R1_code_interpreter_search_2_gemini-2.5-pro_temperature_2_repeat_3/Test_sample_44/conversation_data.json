    "**1. System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    where n is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   The problem defines a unit of energy E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2).\n*   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as E_n = n^2 * E.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level *n* and the spin projection *m_s* (which can be spin up, +1/2, or spin down, -1/2).\n*   This means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   To find the ground state energy, we must place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1 (E_1 = 1^2 * E = E):** We can place two fermions in this level.\n*   **Level n=2 (E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E):** We place the remaining two fermions in this level.\n*   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)\n    E_ground = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level. The new configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in level n=1 (E_1 = E)\n    *   One particle in level n=2 (E_2 = 4E)\n    *   One particle in level n=3 (E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E)\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    E_first = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_first = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider various possible excitations from the ground state and compare their total energies.\n*   The ground state configuration has an energy of 10E.\n*   The first excited state has an energy of 15E.\n*   Let's find other low-lying excited state configurations:\n    *   **Configuration A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n        E_A = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Configuration B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n        E_B = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Configuration C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4 (E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E).\n        E_C = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   Listing the calculated energies in increasing order:\n    1.  Ground State: 10E\n    2.  First Excited State: 15E\n    3.  Second lowest excited state: 18E\n    4.  Next excited state: 20E\n    5.  ...and so on.\n\nThe energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
