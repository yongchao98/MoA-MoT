    "The user wants to know which fundamental symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Symmetries:**\n\n    *   **Lorentz Symmetry & Poincare Symmetry (1 & 2):** The Standard Model Effective Field Theory is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with special relativity. The symmetries of special relativity are captured by the Poincare group, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Therefore, any valid quantum field theory like SMEFT must be constructed from operators that are invariant under Poincare transformations. Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of Poincare symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. This is a foundational requirement. Thus, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n    *   **CP Symmetry (3):** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that CP symmetry is violated in the Standard Model, specifically in the weak sector via the complex phase in the CKM matrix. SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators to parameterize potential new physics. One of the main goals of SMEFT is to provide a framework for exploring all possible sources of symmetry violation, including new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are explicitly constructed *without* assuming CP is a good symmetry. There are many operators in the SMEFT that violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry.\n\n    *   **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is, by construction, a local and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the CPT theorem applies directly to it. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   We have established that Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n    *   We have established that CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n    *   Let's check the given choices:\n        *   A) 1, 2, 4: This combination correctly identifies Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT as required symmetries.\n        *   B) 3, 4: This is incorrect because it includes the non-required CP symmetry (3).\n        *   C) 1, 3, 4: This is incorrect because it includes the non-required CP symmetry (3).\n        *   D) 1, 2: This is incomplete as it omits the fundamental CPT symmetry (4).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A, as it includes all the symmetries that must be respected by the operators in SMEFT.\n\n<<<A>>>"
