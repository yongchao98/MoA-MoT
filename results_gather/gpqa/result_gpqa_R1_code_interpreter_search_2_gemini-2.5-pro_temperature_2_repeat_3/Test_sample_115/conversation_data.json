    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify compound D:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   A 6H triplet is characteristic of two equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (CH₂). The triplet arises from splitting by the two protons on the CH₂ group (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   A 4H quartet is characteristic of two equivalent methylene groups (2 x CH₂), each adjacent to a methyl group (CH₃). The quartet arises from splitting by the three protons on the CH₃ group (n+1 = 3+1 = 4).\n*   This pattern (a triplet and a quartet with a 3:2 proton ratio) is the classic signature of an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-). Since the integration is 6H and 4H, the molecule contains two equivalent ethyl groups.\n*   The simplest alkane that fits this description and is known to undergo monobromination is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). For a symmetrical molecule like n-butane, the two terminal CH₃ groups are equivalent, and the two internal CH₂ groups are equivalent. While the signal for the internal CH₂ groups is technically a multiplet (split by both the adjacent CH₃ and CH₂ groups), it is often simplified or appears as a broad multiplet that could be described as a quartet in an introductory problem context. The chemical shifts are also appropriate for an alkane.\n*   Therefore, Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction.\n*   There are two possible products: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n*   The stability of the intermediate free radical determines the major product. A secondary radical (at C2) is more stable than a primary radical (at C1).\n*   Therefore, the major product of the reaction is 2-bromobutane.\n*   Compound B is 2-bromobutane (CH₃CH(Br)CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a classic E2 elimination reaction (dehydrohalogenation).\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, elimination favors the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n*   Elimination of H from C1 gives but-1-ene (a monosubstituted alkene).\n*   Elimination of H from C3 gives but-2-ene (a disubstituted alkene).\n*   The major product is but-2-ene. The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers, which is true for but-2-ene (cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene).\n*   Compound C is but-2-ene (CH₃CH=CHCH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n*   This step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the *cis-isomer* of Compound C and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n    *   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, which forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n*   The substituents on the diene are an -OH group at C1 and a -CH₃ group at the other end (C4 of the diene system). The substituents on the dienophile are two -CH₃ groups.\n*   The resulting product will have the parent name 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. This allows us to eliminate options B and C, which have a different carbon skeleton (4,6,6-trimethyl...).\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine the stereochemistry of the product to choose between options A and D.\n    1.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The cis stereochemistry of the dienophile (cis-but-2-ene) is retained in the product. This means the two methyl groups originating from the dienophile (at positions C5 and C6 of the new ring) must be **cis** to each other.\n    2.  **Analyzing the Options:** We need to know what R/S configurations correspond to a cis relationship for substituents on adjacent carbons (like C5 and C6). For two adjacent stereocenters, a *cis* relationship corresponds to (R,S) or (S,R) configurations, while a *trans* relationship corresponds to (R,R) or (S,S).\n        *   Option A: (..., 5S, 6R). This (S,R) configuration indicates a **cis** relationship between the groups at C5 and C6. This is consistent with the use of a cis-dienophile.\n        *   Option D: (..., 5S, 6S). This (S,S) configuration indicates a **trans** relationship between the groups at C5 and C6. This would have required a trans-dienophile.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the required cis-stereochemistry from the dienophile, we can definitively eliminate option D. Option A is the only choice that correctly reflects the stereochemistry of the methyl groups at C5 and C6.\n\nThe other stereochemical features of option A (the cis relationship between C1 and C4 from the E,E-diene and the overall relationship between the substituent pairs dictated by the endo rule) are also consistent with the expected product of this Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nFinal verification:\n*   A: n-butane\n*   B: 2-bromobutane\n*   C: but-2-ene\n*   cis-C + diene -> D\n*   The use of cis-but-2-ene dictates that the methyl groups at C5 and C6 of the product must be cis to each other. A cis relationship on adjacent carbons is designated (R,S) or (S,R).\n*   Option A is (1S,4R,5S,6R). The C5 and C6 centers are (S,R), which is cis.\n*   Option D is (1S,4R,5S,6S). The C5 and C6 centers are (S,S), which is trans.\n*   Therefore, Option A is the correct product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
