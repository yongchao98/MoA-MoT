    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\n1.  **Initial Moles:** We start with 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n2.  **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water, making the new total volume 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ (0.0400 L).\n3.  **New Concentration:** The concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** This point in the titration is a buffer region, where both acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), are present. The pH is best calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKₐ + log( [Conjugate Base] / [Acid] )\n2.  **pKₐ Calculation:**\n    pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n3.  **Ratio at 25% Titration:** At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted into acetate by the NaOH. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n    *   Ratio of [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n4.  **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = pKₐ + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 + (-0.477)\n    pH ≈ 4.257 or 4.26\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Reaction Completion:** At the equivalence point, all the initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming 0.001 moles of sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n2.  **Volume at Equivalence:** We need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 moles of acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n3.  **Total Volume and Acetate Concentration:** The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial acid volume plus the added NaOH volume.\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    The concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n4.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion is a weak base and reacts with water (hydrolyzes) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n5.  **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found from the acid dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n6.  **Calculating [OH⁻]:** We can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, where `x` is the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n7.  **pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculation for 25% Titration ---\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculation for Equivalence Point ---\n# 1.

    "**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivations**\n\n**1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.0010 mol\n*   **New volume after dilution:**\n    Total Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    [HA] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by reacting with NaOH. This is a buffer region, so we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKₐ + log( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n\n*   **Calculate pKₐ:**\n    pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    At this point, 25% of the acid is now A⁻, and 75% remains as HA.\n    The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial 0.0010 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH to form 0.0010 moles of sodium acetate (NaA). The solution is now essentially a solution of the weak base, acetate (A⁻).\n\n*   **Find the volume of NaOH needed:**\n    Volume(NaOH) = Moles / Molarity = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.0 cm³\n*   **Find the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH\n    Total Volume = 40.0 cm³ + 10.0 cm³ = 50.0 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻]:**\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n*   **Calculate the pH of the weak base solution:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kₑ:\n    Kₑ = Kₖ / Kₐ = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    Now we set up an equilibrium expression: Kₑ = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [HA] = x.\n    5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n    Since Kₑ is very small, we can approximate 0.020 - x ≈ 0.020.\n    x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26** and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
