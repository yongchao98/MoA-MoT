As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single Mutant Phenotypes**\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This means G1 is responsible for some portion of the resistance. The plant loses 25% of its resistance without G1.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for resistance. Without G2, the entire resistance pathway fails. This makes G2 a prime candidate for a master regulator, such as a transcription factor that turns on the other resistance genes.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. This means G3 is also important for resistance, responsible for about half of it.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Mutant Phenotypes to Determine Epistasis**\n\nEpistasis is a genetic interaction where the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of the masking (epistatic) gene. This helps us understand the gene hierarchy (which gene acts upstream/downstream of another).\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:**\n    *   Phenotype of g1: 75% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g1g2: 0% resistance\n    *   The g1g2 double mutant has the same phenotype as the g2 single mutant. This means the g2 mutation masks the effect of the g1 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This is consistent with G2 acting upstream of G1 in the pathway (e.g., G2 is a TF that activates G1). If G2 is off, it doesn't matter if G1 is functional or not.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:**\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g3: 50% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g2g3: 0% resistance\n    *   The g2g3 double mutant has the same phenotype as the g2 single mutant. This means the g2 mutation masks the effect of the g3 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This is also consistent with G2 being an upstream transcription factor that activates G3.\n\n*   **Conclusion from Epistasis:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its knockout causes a total loss of function, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is a transcription factor required for the expression of both G1 and G3.** The pathway looks something like this:\n    G2 → (activates) G1\n       ↘ (activates) G3\n\n**3. Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3**\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:**\n    *   Phenotype of g1: 75% resistance (a loss of 25%)\n    *   Phenotype of g3: 50% resistance (a loss of 50%)\n    *   If G1 and G3 worked in completely independent (additive) pathways, we would expect the double mutant to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance of the g1g3 double mutant is only **10%**.\n    *   This effect, where the double mutant is much weaker than the sum of the individual mutants' effects, is called a **synergistic interaction**. It often indicates that the two genes (G1 and G3) have partially overlapping or compensatory functions. This is a classic example of **gene redundancy**. They work in parallel to contribute to resistance, and the loss of both is more devastating than a simple sum of their individual contributions.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options based on our Conclusions**\n\n*   **Our Conclusions:**\n    1.  G2 is a transcription factor.\n    2.  G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 (This isn't stated in all options but is key to finding the TF).\n    3.  G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (synergistic interaction).\n\n*   **Let's check the options:**\n    *   A) G1 is a transcription factor... - **Incorrect.** Our evidence points strongly to G2 being the TF.\n    *   B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1 - **Incorrect.** While \"G2 is a TF\" is correct, \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is false. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) does not match the g3 phenotype (50%).\n    *   C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3 - **Mostly Correct.** It correctly identifies G2 as the TF and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The last clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is factually incorrect based on the data (the g1g3 phenotype of 10% does not match the g1 phenotype of 75%). However, the first two statements are strongly supported and are the main conclusions from the experiment. This option is the best fit despite the error in the final clause.\n    *   D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3 - **Incorrect.** \"Pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment. \"Gene redundancy\" is a much better description of the G1/G3 interaction. The epistasis claim is also false.\n\n**Final Choice:** Option C contains the two most important and correct conclusions drawn from the data. The error in its final clause is likely a mistake in the question's construction. Therefore, it is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
