    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding by a conductor. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an internal cavity. The net charge of the conductor is zero.\n\n2.  **Placing the Charge:** A positive charge `+q` is placed somewhere inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be zero. Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity. Since the electric field everywhere on this surface is zero, the total electric flux through it is zero. Gauss's Law ($\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enc}/\\epsilon_o$) then dictates that the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. As we have the charge `+q` inside the cavity, a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner wall of the cavity to make the total enclosed charge `(+q) + (-q) = 0`. This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself non-uniformly on the inner surface to ensure the field from it and the point charge `+q` cancel perfectly within the conductor material.\n\n4.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. By placing the charge `+q` inside and inducing a charge `-q` on the inner surface, we have effectively \"pulled\" `-q` charge from the conductor's mobile electrons. To maintain the overall zero charge of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A crucial property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields its interior from external electric fields and its exterior from interior electric fields. The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is the superposition of the fields from three sources:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n    The shielding principle tells us that the combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is exactly zero for all points *outside* the cavity. Therefore, for the point P, we only need to consider the field from the charge on the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Field from the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge inside the cavity or the cavity's shape due to the shielding effect. Since the outer surface is a sphere (of radius `R`), this charge `+q` will distribute itself perfectly uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Field at Point P:** According to the shell theorem, the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field that would be produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the large spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta`, are all distractors. They describe the internal configuration, but due to electrostatic shielding, this information is irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor. The external field only depends on the total charge enclosed by the conductor's outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Depends on internal geometry.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. Uses distance from the cavity's center.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Depends on internal geometry.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
