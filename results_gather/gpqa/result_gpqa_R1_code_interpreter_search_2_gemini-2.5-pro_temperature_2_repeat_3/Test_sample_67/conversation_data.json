    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment is given by the operator $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin operator and $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    Initially, there is a magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}$ in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. The interaction energy (Hamiltonian) is $H_{initial} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B} = -\\gamma B S_z$.\n    For the moment to be aligned, the energy must be at its minimum. This occurs when the spin is in the \"spin up\" state along the z-axis. This is the eigenstate of the $S_z$ operator with the positive eigenvalue, $+\\hbar/2$. Let's denote this state as $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |\\uparrow_z\\rangle$. In the standard basis where $|\\uparrow_z\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|\\downarrow_z\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the initial state is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The expectation value of the spin at $t=0$ is $\\langle \\vec{S} \\rangle_0 = (0, 0, \\hbar/2)$.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution:**\n    At $t=0$, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to $\\vec{B}' = B \\hat{y}$ (same magnitude $B$, new direction +Y).\n    The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is $H' = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}' = -\\gamma (\\vec{S} \\cdot B\\hat{y}) = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n    The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iH't/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Quantity to be Calculated:**\n    We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. This is the expectation value $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$.\n    Since $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$, we need to calculate $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n    A magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ experiences a torque $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}$. This torque causes a change in the spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$ according to $\\frac{d\\vec{S}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}$.\n    Since $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, we have $\\frac{d\\vec{S}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\vec{S} \\times \\vec{B})$.\n    By Ehrenfest's theorem, the expectation value of the spin follows the same classical equation: $\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma (\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}')$.\n    This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ around the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}'$ with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.\n    In our case, the field is $\\vec{B}' = B\\hat{y}$ and the initial spin expectation is $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle_0$ along the z-axis. The spin vector $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle$ will precess around the y-axis. As it precesses, its z-component will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the precession frequency.\n    Therefore, the oscillation frequency is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n5.  **Method 2: Quantum Mechanical Calculation (Schrödinger Picture)**\n    *   **Hamiltonian and Spin Operators:**\n        $H' = -\\gamma B S_y = -\\gamma B \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = -\\frac{\\omega_0 \\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$, where $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B$ and $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        $S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **Time Evolution Operator:**\n        $U(t) = e^{-iH't/\\hbar} = \\exp\\left(-i (-\\frac{\\omega_0 \\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) t / \\hbar\\right) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2} \\sigma_y\\right)$.\n        Using the identity $e^{i\\theta A} = \\cos(\\theta)I + i\\sin(\\theta)A$ for any matrix A where $A^2=I$ (like Pauli matrices), we get:\n        $U(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}\\right)I + i \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}\\right)\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\omega_0 t / 2) & \\sin(\\omega_0 t / 2) \\\\ -\\sin(\\omega_0 t / 2) & \\cos(\\omega_0 t / 2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **State at time t:**\n        $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t) |\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\omega_0 t / 2) & \\sin(\\omega_0 t / 2) \\\\ -\\sin(\\omega_0 t / 2) & \\cos(\\omega_0 t / 2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\omega_0 t / 2) \\\\ -\\sin(\\omega_0 t / 2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **Expectation value of Sz:**\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}) & -\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}) \\\\ -\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}) \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}\\right) - \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 t}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n    *   **Simplify using the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:**\n        $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_0 t)$.\n    *   **Find the expectation value of the magnetic moment:**\n        $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_0 t)$.\n    *   The expression for the average z-component of the moment oscillates as $\\cos(\\omega_0 t)$. The angular frequency of this oscillation is $\\omega_0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods show that the oscillation angular frequency is $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B$. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) gamma*B\n    B) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) gamma*B/2\n\n    The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
