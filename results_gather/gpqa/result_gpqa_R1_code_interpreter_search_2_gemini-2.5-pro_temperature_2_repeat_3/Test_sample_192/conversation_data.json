    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   We are told that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`.\n    *   The relationship is given by the proportionality: `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   In astronomy, when we say \"the number of stars varies with X\", it typically refers to the *cumulative* number of stars counted up to a certain limit of X. In this case, it means the total number of stars observed with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. As `plx` gets smaller (i.e., we look at more distant stars), the cumulative number `N` increases.\n\n2.  **Establish the relationship between parallax and distance:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. For small angles, this relationship is an inverse proportion.\n    *   The formula is `r = 1/plx`, where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax in arcseconds.\n    *   Therefore, `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance:**\n    *   We can substitute the relationship from step 2 into the given relationship from step 1.\n    *   We have `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r`:\n        `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n        `N ∝ r^5`\n    *   This tells us that the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This quantity represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    *   We start with the proportionality `N ∝ r^5`. We can write this as an equation `N(r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation:\n        `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n        `dN/dr = (5k) * r^4`\n    *   Since `5k` is just another constant, we find the proportionality for the number of stars per unit range of distance:\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) ~ r^5 (This is the cumulative number `N`, not `dN/dr`)\n        B) ~ r^2 (This would imply a uniform distribution of stars, `N ~ r^3`)\n        C) ~ r^3\n        D) ~ r^4 (This matches our derived relationship)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
