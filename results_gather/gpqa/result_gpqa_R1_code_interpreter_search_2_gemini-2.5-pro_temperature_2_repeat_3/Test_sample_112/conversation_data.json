    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening and shift to a lower wavenumber compared to alcohol O-H stretches (typically 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens definitively confirms the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene functional group) in the molecule.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the `[COOH]+` fragment ion, which has a mass of (12.01 for C) + (16.00 for O) + (16.00 for O) + (1.01 for H) ≈ 45.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O stretch) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly points to the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    2.  A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This allows us to eliminate the options with only one oxygen: C6H10O (A) and C6H12O (C).\n    3.  We are left with two possibilities: C6H12O2 (B) and C6H10O2 (D).\n    4.  The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650 cm⁻¹) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in addition to the carboxylic acid.\n    5.  To determine the correct formula, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options and compare it to what the identified functional groups require. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n        *   **DoU Formula:** DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C, H, O).\n        *   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This formula corresponds to a molecule with one degree of unsaturation (e.g., one double bond or one ring). Hexanoic acid (CH3(CH2)4COOH) has this formula, and its only unsaturation is the C=O bond. It does not have a C=C bond.\n        *   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation.\n    6.  Our unknown compound has been shown to contain a C=O bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C bond (a second degree of unsaturation). The total required degrees of unsaturation is 1 + 1 = 2.\n    7.  The formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which perfectly matches the spectroscopic evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
