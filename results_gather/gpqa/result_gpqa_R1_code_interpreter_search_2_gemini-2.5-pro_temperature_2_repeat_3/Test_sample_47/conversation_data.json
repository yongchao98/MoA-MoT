    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, one of the alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) of cyclohexanone is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a ring contraction.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon that does *not* bear the halogen (C6).\n2.  The resulting enolate attacks the carbon with the bromine atom (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring. The ring opens in a way that forms the more stable carbanion, which is at the more substituted carbon (C1).\n4.  Protonation of the carbanion (typically during aqueous workup) yields a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** SOCl₂, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not powerful enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol, unlike stronger agents like LiAlH₄.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OtBu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n \n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe final product is **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n \n\nAt room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational interconversion. The time-averaged conformation has a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane) that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, its attached hydrogen (H_α), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nBecause of this plane of symmetry:\n*   The C2 carbon is chemically equivalent to the C5 carbon.\n*   The C4 carbon is chemically equivalent to the C3 carbon.\n\nNow let's count the unique hydrogen environments (sets of protons that would give a distinct signal in an ¹H NMR spectrum):\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (H_aldehyde):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The Alpha Proton (H_α):** The proton on C1 is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (2nd type)\n3.  **The Beta Protons (on C2 and C5):** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is `cis` to the aldehyde group, and one is `trans`. The same applies to C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the `cis`-proton on C2 is equivalent to the `cis`-proton on C5, and the `trans`-proton on C2 is equivalent to the `trans`-proton on C5. This gives two more distinct proton types. (3rd and 4th types)\n4.  **The Gamma Protons (on C3 and C4):** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, they are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C4. This adds two final distinct proton types. (5th and 6th types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   1 (H_aldehyde)\n*   1 (H_α on C1)\n*   2 (H_β on C2/C5)\n*   2 (H_γ on C3/C4)\n\nAdding these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
