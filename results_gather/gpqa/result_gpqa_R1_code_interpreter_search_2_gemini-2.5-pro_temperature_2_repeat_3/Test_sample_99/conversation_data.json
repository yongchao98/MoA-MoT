    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the incorrect statement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\nCompound A has the molecular formula C3H6. This corresponds to either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane (a cycloalkane). The reaction with Br2 in CCl4 is a classic test for unsaturation and an electrophilic addition reaction characteristic of alkenes. Therefore, Compound A is propene.\n*   **A = Propene (CH3-CH=CH2)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\nPropene reacts with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) via an addition reaction across the double bond.\n*   CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n*   **B = 1,2-Dibromopropane**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\nCompound B (1,2-Dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base that causes a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) to form an alkyne.\n*   CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n*   **C = Propyne**\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\nCompound C (Propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclic polymerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne trimerize to form a symmetrically substituted benzene derivative.\n*   3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene\n*   **D = Mesitylene (1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene)**\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound E**\nCompound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This typically refers to the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4) used for electrophilic aromatic nitration. The three methyl groups in mesitylene are activating and direct the incoming electrophile (NO2+) to the positions 2, 4, or 6.\n*   Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene\n*   **E = 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound F**\nCompound E (a nitro-aromatic compound) is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + [H] --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (or 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline)\n*   **F = Mesidine (2,4,6-Trimethylaniline)**\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound G**\nCompound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature (0-5 °C). This reaction is called diazotization and it forms a diazonium salt.\n*   Mesidine + HNO2 + HCl --> 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride + 2 H2O\n*   **G = 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt**\n\n**Step 8: Identify Compound H**\nCompound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which involves warming with an aqueous base. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol.\n*   [2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium]⁺ + OH⁻ --> 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol + N₂\n*   **H = Mesitol (2,4,6-Trimethylphenol)**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.**\n*   Compound C is Propyne (CH3-C≡CH). It is a gas at room temperature (boiling point: -23.2 °C) and, like other small hydrocarbons, is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n*   Compound H is Mesitol (2,4,6-Trimethylphenol). The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, typically producing a purple, green, or blue color due to complex formation with the Fe³⁺ ion. However, phenols that are sterically hindered at the positions ortho to the hydroxyl group, like Mesitol (which has methyl groups at positions 2 and 6), do not give a positive test because the bulky groups prevent the formation of the colored complex. The solution remains yellow, which is the color of the ferric chloride solution itself, indicating a negative result. Therefore, the statement that it *gives* a yellow color (implying a positive reaction) is **incorrect**.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n*   Compound D is Mesitylene (1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene). Due to the high symmetry of the molecule:\n    *   The nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups will produce a single signal, which is a singlet (no adjacent protons).\n    *   The three protons on the aromatic ring are also equivalent to each other and will produce a second single signal, which is a singlet.\n*   Thus, its 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n*   Compound F is Mesidine (2,4,6-Trimethylaniline). Aniline and its derivatives are key starting materials in the synthesis of many industrial dyes, especially azo dyes. They can be diazotized (like in the step to form G) and then coupled with other aromatic compounds. This statement is **correct**.\n\nThe question asks for the **incorrect** statement. Based on the analysis, statement B is incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>"
