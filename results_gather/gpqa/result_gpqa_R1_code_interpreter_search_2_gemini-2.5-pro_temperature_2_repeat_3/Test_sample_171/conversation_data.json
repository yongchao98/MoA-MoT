    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), such as a stellar photosphere.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower state (level 1) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n$N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T))$\n\nWhere:\n*   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number densities of atoms in the excited and lower states.\n*   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the \"excitation ratio\" for a star as $R = N_2 / N_1$.\n\n**2. Applying to Star 1 and Star 2**\n\nWe can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n*   For Star 1 (temperature $T_1$): $R_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_1))$\n*   For Star 2 (temperature $T_2$): $R_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_2))$\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means:\n$R_1 = 2 * R_2$\n\n**3. Setting up the Equation**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n\n$(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_2 / g_1) * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_2))]$\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, $(g_2 / g_1)$, is the same for both stars (as it concerns the same energy levels of the same atom) and cancels out:\n\n$exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_2))$\n\n**4. Solving for Temperature**\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n$ln[exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_2))]$\n\nUsing the logarithm properties $ln(e^x) = x$ and $ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$:\n\n$-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + [-\\Delta E / (k_B * T_2)]$\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate $ln(2)$:\n\n$\\Delta E / (k_B * T_2) - \\Delta E / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2)$\n\nFactor out the common term, $\\Delta E / k_B$:\n\n$(\\Delta E / k_B) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)$\n\nCombine the terms in the parenthesis with a common denominator ($T_1*T_2$):\n\n$(\\Delta E / k_B) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)] = ln(2)$\n\n**5. Using the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\nThe value of the Boltzmann constant, $k_B$, is approximately $1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio $\\Delta E / k_B$:\n\n$\\Delta E / k_B \\approx (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K) \\approx 1 K$\n\nThe problem's numerical values are deliberately chosen so that this ratio simplifies to 1. Substituting this into our equation:\n\n$1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)] = ln(2)$\n\nThis gives us the final relationship:\n\n$ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)$\n\nThis equation matches option B. Since star_1 is more excited, it must be hotter ($T_1 > T_2$), making the term $(T_1 - T_2)$ positive, which is consistent with $ln(2)$ also being positive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
