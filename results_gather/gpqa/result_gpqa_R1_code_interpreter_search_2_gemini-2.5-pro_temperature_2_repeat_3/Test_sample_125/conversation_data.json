    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5). The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the methoxy group (OCH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone's carbonyl carbon (C3) is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack this planar group from either face. This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, the products will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry (in a specific conformation) and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). Therefore, (2R, 4S) is a **meso compound**, and (2S, 4R) is the same molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n\n*   The total mixture contains five distinct compounds from the two reactions.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will appear as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will be separated from them, giving another **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and have very different structures, so there will be no accidental co-elution.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to differentiate between all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\n*   The total mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other and also from the meso compound. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Again, there is no risk of co-elution between products of Reaction I and Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\n\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
