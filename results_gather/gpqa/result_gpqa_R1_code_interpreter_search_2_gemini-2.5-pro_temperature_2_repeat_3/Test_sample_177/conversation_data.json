    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Mass Dimensions of Spacetime and Lagrangian Density\n\nIn natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), the action `S` is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over four-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nThe dimension of a spacetime interval `dx` is `[length]`, which in natural units is `[mass]⁻¹`. Therefore, the dimension of the four-volume element `d⁴x` is:\n`[d⁴x] = [mass]⁻⁴`\n\nSince the action `S` is dimensionless, `[S] = 0`, we must have:\n`[S] = [d⁴x][L] = [mass]⁻⁴ [L] = [mass]⁰ = 1` (dimensionless quantity)\nThis implies that the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density `L` must be 4:\n`[L] = 4`\n\nAny term in the Lagrangian density, including the interaction term `L_int`, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nWe can find the mass dimensions of the fields by examining their kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field `ψ`**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_fermion = \\bar{ψ}(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ`.\n    We know `[L_fermion] = 4`.\n    The derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of 1: `[∂_μ] = 1`.\n    The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless matrices.\n    So, `[\\bar{ψ}][ψ][∂_μ] = 4`.\n    Since `\\bar{ψ} = ψ†γ⁰`, they have the same mass dimension: `[\\bar{ψ}] = [ψ]`.\n    `2[ψ] + 1 = 4`\n    `2[ψ] = 3`\n    `[ψ] = 3/2`\n\n*   **Gauge field `Aμ` and Field Strength Tensor `Fμν`**: The kinetic term for a U(1) gauge field (like electromagnetism) is `L_gauge = -1/4 F_{μν}F^{μν}`.\n    We know `[L_gauge] = 4`.\n    This means `[F_{μν}][F^{μν}] = 2[F_{μν}] = 4`, so the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is:\n    `[F_{μν}] = 2`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Mass Dimension of `σ_{μν}`\n\nThe tensor `σ_{μν}` is defined as `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n`[σ_{μν}] = 0`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant `κ`\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n`L_int = κ \\bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`\n\nThe total mass dimension of this term must be 4:\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [\\bar{ψ}] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = 4`\n\nSubstitute the dimensions we found:\n`[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = 4 - 5 = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` is -1.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the Theory is Renormalizable\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimensions of its coupling constants (this is known as power-counting renormalizability).\nThe rule is as follows:\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a positive mass dimension (`[g] > 0`), the interaction is **super-renormalizable**. The operator is called \"relevant\".\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a zero mass dimension (`[g] = 0`), the interaction is **renormalizable**. The operator is called \"marginal\".\n*   If a coupling constant `g` has a negative mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the interaction is **non-renormalizable**. The operator is called \"irrelevant\".\n\nIn our case, we found that `[κ] = -1`. Since the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nIn such theories, when calculating loop corrections in perturbation theory, new types of ultraviolet divergences appear at each order. To cancel these divergences, one would need to introduce an infinite number of new counter-terms, leading to an infinite number of free parameters. This robs the theory of its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
