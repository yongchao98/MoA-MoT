    "This problem requires us to find the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) for it to annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) and produce an electron-positron ($e^{-}e^{+}$) pair. The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$\n\n### 1. Kinematics and Threshold Energy\n\nTo solve this, we use the principle of conservation of four-momentum. The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable 's', is a Lorentz invariant quantity. This means it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference.\n\nThe four-momentum of a particle is given by $P = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where $E$ is the energy and $\\vec{p}$ is the three-momentum. In natural units (where c=1), this is $P = (E, \\vec{p})$. The square of the four-momentum is $P^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = m^2$, where m is the rest mass of the particle.\n\n**Initial State (before collision):**\nLet the high-energy gamma-ray have four-momentum $P_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$ and the CMB photon have $P_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$. Since photons are massless, $E_{\\gamma} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}|$ and $E_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{CMB}|$.\n\nThe total four-momentum of the initial state is $P_{initial} = P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB}$.\nThe invariant mass squared is $s = P_{initial}^2 = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2 = P_{\\gamma}^2 + P_{CMB}^2 + 2P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB}$.\nSince photons have zero rest mass, $P_{\\gamma}^2 = m_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $P_{CMB}^2 = m_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\nThe dot product of the four-momenta is $P_{\\gamma} \\cdot P_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\nSubstituting $|\\vec{p}| = E$ for photons, we get:\n$s = 2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**Final State (after collision):**\nThe final state consists of an electron ($e^{-}$) and a positron ($e^{+}$). The reaction threshold is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. At this threshold, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. In this frame, the total energy is just the sum of their rest mass energies.\n\nTotal energy in the CM frame, $E_{CM} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\nThe invariant mass squared 's' is the square of the total energy in the CM frame:\n$s = (E_{CM})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n**Equating the two expressions for s:**\nBy equating the expressions for 's' from the initial and final states, we get:\n$2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\nTo find the minimum or threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$), we need to consider the most efficient collision scenario. The energy required for $E_{\\gamma}$ is minimized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs in a head-on collision, where the photons are moving towards each other, so $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$ (or $\\pi$ radians), and $\\cos(180^{\\circ}) = -1$.\nIn this case, $(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this value into our equation:\n$2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(2) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n$E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nThis gives us the formula for the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nNow we can plug in the given values:\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511^2) \\times (10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} \\text{ eV}$\n$E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV). We know that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n$E_{\\gamma} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result means that gamma-rays with energies at or above approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV will have their propagation distance (and thus lifetime in the universe) significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated energy of $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV is a very close match to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
