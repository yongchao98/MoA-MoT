    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which of the five listed stars can be observed by *both* the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Constraints**\n\nFor a star to be observable by both facilities, it must meet two main criteria:\n*   **Visibility Criterion (Positional):** The star's position in the sky (its declination, DEC) must be accessible from the geographical locations of both observatories.\n*   **Brightness Criterion (Photometric):** The star's apparent brightness (its apparent V magnitude) must be brighter than the sensitivity limits of both instruments.\n\n**3. Analyze the Visibility (Declination) Constraint**\n\n*   First, I need the latitudes of the two observatories. The provided Wikipedia links give these coordinates.\n    *   **Paranal Observatory:** Located at approximately 24.6° South latitude. Being in the Southern Hemisphere, it has an excellent view of the southern sky but can also observe parts of the northern sky.\n    *   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located at approximately 19.8° North latitude. Being in the Northern Hemisphere, it has an excellent view of the northern sky but can also observe parts of the southern sky.\n*   The problem states to disregard pointing limits like minimum elevation. This simplifies the calculation. A telescope at a given latitude `L` can theoretically see any object that rises above the horizon.\n    *   For Keck Observatory (Latitude L ≈ +19.8° N), the southernmost declination it can see is `L - 90°`, which is `19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`. So, Keck can see stars with **DEC > -70.2°**.\n    *   For Paranal Observatory (Latitude L ≈ -24.6° S), the northernmost declination it can see is `90° + L`, which is `90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. So, Paranal can see stars with **DEC < +65.4°**.\n*   For a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be within the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Brightness (Magnitude) Constraint**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal):** Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude brighter than 17.0 mag (V < 17.0).\n*   **HIRES (Keck):** Can observe stars brighter than 16.0 V mag (V < 16.0).\n*   To be observable by *both*, the star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits. Therefore, the apparent V magnitude of the star must be **V < 16.0**.\n\n**5. Calculate Necessary Parameters**\n\nFor some stars, the apparent magnitude `V` is not given directly. I'll need to calculate it using the distance modulus formula, which accounts for absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d`), and interstellar extinction (`A_V`):\n`V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10pc) + A_V`\nor equivalently\n`V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nWhere extinction `A_V` is given by `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n**6. Evaluate Each Star**\n\nI will now check each star against the two consolidated conditions:\n1.  **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**\n2.  **V < 16.0 mag**\n\nTo ensure accuracy in my calculations, I'll use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Define Conditions ---\n\n# Declination (DEC) limits based on observatory latitudes\nlat_paranal = -24.6\nlat_keck = 19.8\ndec_min_observable = lat_keck - 90.0  # Keck's southern limit\ndec_max_observable = 90.0 + lat_paranal # Paranal's northern limit\n\n# Apparent V-band Magnitude (V) limit\nmag_limit_espresso = 17.0\nmag_limit_hires = 16.0\n# The star must be brighter than the stricter limit (HIRES)\nv_mag_limit = min(mag_limit_espresso, mag_limit_hires)\n\nprint(f\"A star is mutually observable if:\")\nprint(f\"1.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory) and HIRES (Keck Observatory) spectrographs, we need to check two criteria for each star:\n\n1.  **Positional Criterion (Declination):** The star's declination (DEC) must be in a range visible from both observatories.\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. It can observe stars with declinations up to about +65.4° (90° - 24.6°).\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. It can observe stars with declinations down to about -70.2° (19.8° - 90°).\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be in the range **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness Criterion (Apparent Magnitude):** The star's apparent V magnitude (V) must be brighter than the sensitivity limits of *both* instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17.0 mag.\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16.0 mag.\n    *   The stricter limit is from HIRES, so the star must have an apparent magnitude **V < 16.0**.\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude isn't given, we use the distance modulus formula:\n`V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`\nwhere `V` is the apparent magnitude, `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc), and `A_V` is the interstellar extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   Declination (DEC) = -75°. This is outside the required -70.2° to +65.4° range.\n    *   **Result:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   Declination (DEC) = 55°. This is within the required range.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than the V < 16.0 limit.\n    *   **Result:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   Declination (DEC) = 48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the V < 16.0 limit.\n    *   **Result:** Observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   Declination (DEC) = -48°. This is within the required range.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude calculation:\n        *   `A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24`\n        *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`\n    *   V = 16.74 mag, which is not brighter than the V < 16.0 limit.\n    *   **Result:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   Declination (DEC) = 60°. This is within the required range.\n    *   Apparent V magnitude calculation:\n        *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag`\n    *   V ≈ 15.0 mag, which is brighter than the V < 16.0 limit.\n    *   **Result:** Observable by both.\n\nThe stars that satisfy both the declination and brightness criteria are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
