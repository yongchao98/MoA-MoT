    "This is a classic problem in chemical analysis, particularly for synthetic molecules with stereocenters like peptides. Let's break down the evidence and evaluate the options.\n\n**1. Analysis of the experimental data:**\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Observation:** A single alpha-proton appears as two distinct peaks with similar chemical shifts.\n    *   **Integrals:** The total integral of the two peaks is 1H, and they have roughly equal integrals to each other. This means we have two species in a roughly 1:1 ratio, and in each species, this position is occupied by a single proton.\n    *   **Coupling:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so the peak splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This observation suggests the presence of two different molecular environments for that specific alpha-proton. Since the rest of the spectrum is largely as expected, these two species must be very closely related.\n\n*   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n    *   **Observation 1 (LC):** Two clearly defined peaks are observed in the chromatogram with equal intensities. This confirms the presence of two distinct compounds that can be separated by chromatography. The equal intensities again point to a 1:1 ratio. The separation occurs at an elevated temperature, suggesting the two species are stable and not just rapidly interconverting conformers that would likely coalesce at high temperatures.\n    *   **Observation 2 (MS):** Both separated peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass corresponds to the expected mass of the target peptide.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The two compounds have the same mass (and thus the same elemental formula) but different physical properties (leading to different retention times in LC). This is the definition of isomers.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the proposed explanations:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that changed the covalent structure, for example, by adding an extra amino acid. This would result in a molecule with a different molecular formula and therefore a significantly different mass. This contradicts the MS data, which shows both peaks have the *expected* mass.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and a different molecular weight than the final product. This contradicts the MS data showing the correct mass for both peaks.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give identical spectra. You would see only *one* set of peaks, not two.\n    *   On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are also indistinguishable and co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   To see two peaks for enantiomers, you would need a chiral environment (chiral NMR solvent, chiral shift reagent, or chiral LC column). The problem does not state that a chiral method was used, and the standard assumption is that achiral methods were employed unless otherwise specified. Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another. This occurs in molecules with two or more stereocenters.\n    *   **Properties:** Diastereomers are distinct compounds with different physical properties (melting points, boiling points, solubilities, etc.).\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, their NMR spectra are different, even in an achiral solvent. Corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have different chemical shifts. Thus, seeing two peaks for the alpha-proton is perfectly explained. The 1:1 ratio of the peak integrals suggests the diastereomers were formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated on a standard achiral LC column, which would result in two distinct peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. The equal peak intensities on the LC chromatogram confirm the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n    *   **Synthetic Context:** This situation is very common in peptide synthesis. If one of the chiral amino acid starting materials was not enantiomerically pure (e.g., using a mix of L- and D-alanine) or if one of the stereocenters racemized during the coupling reaction, a mixture of diastereomers of the final peptide would be produced.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that fits all the experimental observations: two distinct signals in the ¹H NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and the same correct mass for both species in the MS.\n\n<<<D>>>"
