    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the two mean free paths (λ):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n2.  **Analyze λ₁ (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile and the target particles are moving. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for this by introducing a factor of `sqrt(2)`.\n    *   The formula is: **λ₁ = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the kinetic cross-section for a gas-gas collision (approximated as πd², where `d` is the kinetic diameter of the molecule).\n\n3.  **Analyze λ₂ (Mean Free Path of Electrons):**\n    *   This refers to the average distance an electron from the microscope beam travels before scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   In this case, the electron is the projectile, and the gas molecule is the target.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV (1 MeV), meaning they are relativistic and moving at a very high velocity (over 94% the speed of light). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n    *   The formula is: **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron-gas molecule interaction.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is a kinetic collision, essentially governed by the physical size of the molecules. Two molecules of diameter `d` collide if their centers come within a distance `d` of each other. The cross-section `σ_gg` is `πd²`, on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ to 10⁻¹⁸ m². The effective cross-section in the λ₁ formula is `sqrt(2) * πd²`.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is not a simple hard-sphere collision. The electron is a point-like particle. The interaction is a Coulombic (electrostatic) scattering event between the electron and the electric field of the atom's nucleus and its orbital electrons. An atom is mostly empty space. A very high-energy (1 MeV) electron is highly penetrating and must pass very close to the nucleus or an orbital electron to be significantly deflected (scattered). Therefore, the probability of a collision is very low.\n    *   As a result, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is **much smaller** than the kinetic cross-section of two gas molecules.\n    *   So, we have the crucial relationship: **σ_eg << sqrt(2) * σ_gg**.\n\n5.  **Compare λ₁ and λ₂:**\n    *   We are comparing `λ₁ = 1 / (n * sqrt(2) * σ_gg)` and `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`.\n    *   Since the number density `n` is the same for both, the comparison depends on the denominators.\n    *   Because `σ_eg` is much smaller than `sqrt(2) * σ_gg`, the denominator of λ₂ is much smaller than the denominator of λ₁.\n    *   When the denominator of a fraction is smaller, the value of the fraction is larger.\n    *   Therefore, we can strongly conclude that **λ₂ >> λ₁**. The mean free path of the electrons is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: Correct. Since λ₂ is much, much larger than λ₁, it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only statement that is logically consistent with the physical reality.\n    *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: Incorrect. This option suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁, which contradicts the physics.\n\nThe number `1.22` is likely a distractor intended to make one search for a specific, complex formula. The core of the question tests the fundamental physical principle that the interaction cross-section for a high-energy electron with an atom is far smaller than the kinetic collision cross-section between two atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
