Summary of the Physics and Given Information**\n*   **Decay:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n*   **Initial State:** The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is 0 and its initial energy is its rest energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n*   **Given Rest Energies:**\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n    *   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n    *   The neutrino is assumed to be massless, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy equals the sum of the total energies of the final particles.\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy `E` is related to momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$. Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic, so $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n*   **Solving for Momentum:** We can combine the conservation equations to solve for the momentum term `pc`.\n    1.  Substitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n    2.  Rearrange and square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    3.  Expand and simplify:\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n    4.  Solve for `pc`:\n        $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n*   **Numerical Calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n        $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n        So, $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n    2.  Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon. The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, which is shared between the products:\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{total} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n        Now, find the muon's kinetic energy:\n        $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3.

Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (a positive pion, π⁺) into two other particles (a positive muon, μ⁺, and a muon neutrino, ν). This is a classic two-body decay problem that must adhere to two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the particles can move at relativistic speeds, we must use the total relativistic energy ($E = KE + mc^2$).\n\n**2.

Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle (a positive pion, π⁺) into two other particles (a positive muon, μ⁺, and a muon neutrino, ν). This is a classic two-body decay problem that must adhere to two fundamental laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the particles can move at relativistic speeds, we must use the total relativistic energy ($E = KE + mc^2$).\n\n**2.

Understand the Physical Principles**\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary particle ($\\pi^+$) into two other particles ($\\mu^+$ and $\\nu$). This is a classic two-body decay problem that must adhere to two fundamental laws of physics in the context of special relativity:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Set Up the Equations**\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Rest energy of pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n    *   Rest energy of muon, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n    *   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is 0.\n    *   The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial momentum is zero, the final products must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each product particle be `p`.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy `E` is related to momentum `p` and rest mass `m` by the equation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2} = pc$.

The solution involves applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum using relativistic mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process and Given Information:**\n    *   The decay is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n    *   The initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n    *   Rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Rest energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is assumed to be massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the initial pion is at rest, the initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's denote this momentum magnitude as `p`.\n    *   $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion: $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$): $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Therefore, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2} = pc$. Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic, so $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Momentum and Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   Substitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n    *   Rearrange to isolate the square root term and square both sides:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   Expand the left side and simplify:\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n        $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n    *   Solve for `pc`:\n        $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Plug in the given values:\n        $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n        $KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n        The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energy, which is shared between the products:\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = (139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV}) - KE_{\\nu}$\n        $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.
