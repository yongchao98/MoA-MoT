The analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the chemical principles, even if the final letter choice varies due to inconsistent option mapping.\n\n**Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks key symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound, highlighting the careful points needed for a correct assessment.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl.\n*   **Careful Point**: The key feature is the presence of bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 1 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point**: The key feature to look for is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion**: Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 2 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n*   **Careful Point**: We must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, **compound 3 does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point**: The molecule is planar and has multiple elements of symmetry. It has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, **compound 4 does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that:\n*   Compound 1 is optically active.\n*   Compound 2 is optically active.\n*   Compound 3 is not optically active.\n*   Compound 4 is not optically active.\n\nThe correct answer is the option that includes only compounds 1 and 2.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral, meaning its molecular structure is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis involves checking for features that cause chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) and features that prevent it (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The critical feature is the presence of large, bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (the positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings).\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** The steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The most common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (a chiral center).\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. We must check for elements of symmetry.\n*   **Careful Point (Plane of Symmetry):** The molecule is not chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings, with one phenyl ring being the reflection of the other.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry Elements):** The molecule is planar. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe analysis confirms that only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Reviewing the options provided in the question:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct option is C, as it correctly identifies compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first synthesize the analysis from all the provided candidate answers.

The key concept is chirality: a molecule is optically active if and only if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image). I will check for features like chiral centers and axial chirality (atropisomerism), and for symmetry elements like planes of symmetry or centers of inversion that would make a molecule achiral.\n\nAfter establishing the correct chemical analysis for all four compounds, I will identify which ones are optically active.

The fundamental principle is that a compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of each compound, highlighting the key points for consideration:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl, composed of two phenyl rings linked by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** The primary feature to consider in such molecules is not a chiral center, but **axial chirality**. This arises when rotation around a single bond is restricted. In this case, all four positions *ortho* to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The steric hindrance from these groups is significant enough to prevent the two rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar.\n*   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation. This conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 1 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** The most common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents. We must examine the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to the following four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 2 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule lacks a chiral center. The crucial step is to check for elements of symmetry that would make it achiral. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Thus, **compound 3 does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. This planarity introduces two key elements of symmetry:\n    1.  A **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    2.  A **center of inversion** (a point of symmetry at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.

The fundamental principle is that a compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of each compound, highlighting the key points for consideration:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl, composed of two phenyl rings linked by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** The primary feature to consider in such molecules is not a chiral center, but **axial chirality**. This arises when rotation around a single bond is restricted. In this case, all four positions *ortho* to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The steric hindrance from these groups is significant enough to prevent the two rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar.\n*   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation. This conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 1 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** The most common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 2 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule lacks a chiral center. The crucial step is to check for elements of symmetry that would make it achiral. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Thus, **compound 3 does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond.

The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is not bonded to four different groups and is not a chiral center.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must check the overall symmetry of the molecule. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and thus superimposable on its mirror image.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral, meaning its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of `dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate`**\n*   **Careful Point:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The key to its stereochemistry is the potential for restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). The steric hindrance caused by these large groups prevents the two rings from rotating freely. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, **compound 1 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. Analysis of `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`**\n*   **Careful Point:** The most common source of chirality in simple organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **compound 2 shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. Analysis of `benzophenone`**\n*   **Careful Point:** Molecules that possess an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, are achiral and thus not optically active.\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule does not have a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, **compound 3 does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. Analysis of `dimethyl fumarate`**\n*   **Careful Point:** Planar molecules often have a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). The *trans* geometry can also introduce a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It is a planar molecule. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule) and also a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, **compound 4 does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe analysis shows that only compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if its molecular structure is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis involves checking for features that cause chirality (like chiral centers or chiral axes) and for elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would make a molecule achiral.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound, incorporating the careful points needed for an accurate assessment.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The critical feature is the presence of substituents at the *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') relative to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** When these *ortho* positions are occupied by sufficiently large and bulky groups, as is the case here with nitro (-NO₂) and methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups, free rotation around the central C-C single bond is prevented due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n*   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure of this molecule is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center.\n*   **Careful Point (Identifying a Chiral Center):** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four chemically distinct groups. For the carbon at position 2, we must identify its four attachments:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. We must check for any elements of chirality or symmetry.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry Elements):** A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, even if it has no chiral centers. Benzophenone has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Careful Point (Planarity and Symmetry):** The C=C double bond forces the core of the molecule to be planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, because it is the *trans*-isomer, it also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis confirms that:\n*   Compound **1** is optically active (chiral).\n*   Compound **2** is optically active (chiral).\n*   Compound **3** is not optically active (achiral).\n*   Compound **4** is not optically active (achiral).\n\nThe question asks which compounds show optical isomerism.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is chiral, meaning its molecular structure is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nHere is the detailed analysis:\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Chirality:** The fundamental condition for optical isomerism is chirality.\n*   **Sources of Chirality:** Chirality can arise from several structural features, most commonly a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers).\n*   **Achirality:** A molecule is achiral (optically inactive) if it possesses an element of symmetry that allows it to be superimposed on its mirror image. The most common of these are a plane of symmetry (a mirror plane within the molecule) and a center of inversion (a point through which all atoms can be reflected to an identical position).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature is the presence of large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (the positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings).\n*   **Reasoning:** The steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the C-C single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses axial chirality, making it chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. We must check for any elements of symmetry.\n*   **Reasoning:** The molecule does not have a chiral center. Crucially, it possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Reasoning:** The molecule is planar due to the carbon-carbon double bond. This planarity means the molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, it has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of multiple symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThe analysis confirms that:\n*   Compound 1 is **optically active**.\n*   Compound 2 is **optically active**.\n*   Compound 3 is **not optically active**.\n*   Compound 4 is **not optically active**.\n\nThe question asks which compounds show optical isomerism.

Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Multiple Sources of Chirality:** Chirality is not limited to molecules with a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents). As demonstrated by compound 1, axial chirality arising from restricted rotation (atropisomerism) is another important cause of optical isomerism.\n*   **The Role of Symmetry:** The definitive test for achirality is the presence of an improper axis of rotation (Sₙ). This includes a plane of symmetry (S₁) and a center of inversion (S₂). Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral because they possess these elements.\n*   **Steric Hindrance in Biphenyls:** For atropisomerism to occur in biphenyls, the ortho-substituents must be sufficiently bulky to prevent rotation. The nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups in compound 1 are large enough to do this.\n*   **Identifying Chiral Centers:** It is essential to confirm that all four groups attached to a potential chiral center are indeed different, as is the case for compound 2.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.
