It acts as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$.

This is a crucial condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Derive the Eigenvalues:** The most elegant and common method, used by nearly all the provided agents, is to square the Hamiltonian operator.\n    *   Let's compute $H^2$:\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is given by $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, the vector is $\\vec{n}$. Applying the identity gives:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$\n    *   Using the condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, we have $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.

The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$, whose eigenvalues are clearly $\\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points and Distractor Analysis\n\nBased on the derivation and the options provided, we can identify several key points that distinguish the correct answer from the distractors.\n\n*   **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ itself has eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out **Option B) +1, -1**.\n*   **The Absence of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined with the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the final answer. This rules out **Option C) +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2** and **Option D) +\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2**.\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition:** The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential for the simplification $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this property.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical and mathematical methods unanimously lead to the conclusion that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. Comparing this result to the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step evaluation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$: A constant with the dimension of energy. It sets the energy scale of the system.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are 2x2 matrices that are fundamental to the description of spin-1/2 systems.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Derivations:**\n    The candidate answers demonstrate a strong consensus on the correct methods to solve this problem. The two most common and correct approaches are:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian.** This is the most elegant method.\n        *   We compute $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        *   A fundamental property of Pauli matrices is that for any unit vector $\\vec{n}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$. This is because $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n}.\\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $\\vec{n}.\\vec{n}=1$, and since the cross product of a vector with itself is zero, $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n}=0$. This simplifies the expression to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n        *   Substituting this back gives $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. The eigenvalues of $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization.** This method is more explicit and confirms the result.\n        *   The Hamiltonian can be written as the matrix $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   Solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ gives $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$.\n        *   Using the unit vector condition ($n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$), the equation becomes $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$.\n        *   The solutions are the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Results and Identify Careful Points:**\n    All valid methods unanimously lead to the conclusion that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are clearly due to a randomization of the option labels, as the physical reasoning in almost every case is sound and points to the same result.\n\n    Here are the crucial points to consider when evaluating the options:\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$.** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option D) `+1, -1`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$.** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since $\\hbar$ is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This rules out option B) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2` and option C) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2`.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The Importance of the Unit Vector $\\vec{n}$.** The condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential for the simplification in all derivation methods. It ensures that $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$ and that $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the consistent results from multiple valid derivations and the process of elimination by analyzing the physical dimensions and definitions, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are unambiguously $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the problem and the reasoning presented in the candidate answers to find the consensus on the correct physical result.

The physical conclusion is the same in all cases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation from multiple standard methods, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. The candidate answers demonstrate a strong consensus on the derivation, even if their final letter choices vary. The most direct and physically insightful method is to square the Hamiltonian.\n\n1.  **Square the Hamiltonian Operator**:\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $H$. Then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$.\n    $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n\n2.  **Use the Pauli Matrix Identity**:\n    A fundamental property of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of its projection onto the Pauli vector is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix. In this problem, the vector is $\\vec{n}$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Unit Vector Condition**:\n    The problem states that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, which means its magnitude is one: $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    Applying this to the identity gives: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)^2 I = I$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Eigenvalues**:\n    Substituting this result back into the expression for the squared Hamiltonian gives:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    Since $\\lambda^2$ is the eigenvalue of $H^2$, we can equate it to the eigenvalue of $\\varepsilon^2 I$. This gives the simple equation:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    Taking the square root yields the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian:\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThis result is confirmed by all valid methods presented in the candidate answers, including direct matrix diagonalization and simplification by choosing a convenient coordinate system. The energy eigenvalues are therefore $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues of +1 and -1. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option C) `+1, -1`.\n\n2.  **The Absence of $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This is a crucial distinction that rules out options A) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2` and D) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n\n3.  **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential. It allows the simplification of $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$ to the identity matrix, which is the key step in the most elegant derivation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from Analysis**: Based on the derivation and the process of elimination, the only physically and mathematically correct answer is that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This matches option B. The widespread disagreement on the final letter choice among the candidate answers, despite their correct reasoning, strongly indicates that the option lettering was randomized for them.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step derivation of the physics problem, the following conclusion is reached.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe objective is to find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Hamiltonian:**\n    *   $\\varepsilon$: A constant with the dimension of energy. It serves as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental 2x2 matrices used to describe spin-1/2 systems.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, so $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Summary of Solution Methods:**\n    The candidate answers demonstrate three valid and standard methods for solving this problem, all of which lead to the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian.** This is the most elegant approach. By squaring the Hamiltonian, $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$. Using the fundamental Pauli matrix identity $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$, and the fact that $|\\vec{n}|=1$, we get $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$. Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization.** This involves writing the Hamiltonian as an explicit 2x2 matrix: $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$. Solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ leads to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$. Using the unit vector condition, this simplifies to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, again yielding $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Simplification by Coordinate Choice.** Since the eigenvalues are physical quantities, they are independent of the choice of coordinate system. We can simplify the problem by aligning the z-axis with the vector $\\vec{n}$, so that $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$. The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are clearly $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The Hamiltonian is directly proportional to the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, its eigenvalues, which represent the system's energy levels, must also be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This rules out options B (+1, -1) and D (+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2), which lack this dependency. The eigenvalues of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself are $\\pm 1$, but the Hamiltonian scales these by $\\varepsilon$.\n\n2.  **The Absence of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the final answer. This rules out options A ($+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$) and D ($+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$).\n\n3.  **The Unit Vector Condition:** The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential. It allows the simplification of $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$ to the identity matrix $I$ and ensures that the term $(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)$ equals 1 in the matrix diagonalization method. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid methods of analysis lead to the same unambiguous result: the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on this physical result, with their derivations being almost universally correct. The variation in the final lettered choice (A, B, C, D) among the agents is a clear artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each one.\n\nBased on the rigorous and consistent derivation, the correct eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.

This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Consensus Method:** The vast majority of the candidate answers use a standard, elegant, and correct method: squaring the Hamiltonian. Let's follow this method.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$.\n    *   We compute $H^2$:\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, the vector is $\\vec{n}$. So, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$. The identity simplifies to:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Verification with Alternative Methods:** As shown in many candidate answers, other methods confirm this result.\n    *   **Direct Matrix Calculation:** Writing $H$ as the matrix $\\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$ and solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ yields $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, giving $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n    *   **Symmetry/Coordinate Choice:** Since the eigenvalues are independent of the coordinate system, we can choose a simple alignment, such as $\\vec{n}$ along the z-axis ($\\vec{n}=(0,0,1)$). The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, $\\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant $\\hbar$ is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This immediately eliminates options A ($+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$) and D ($+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$).\n\n2.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This eliminates option C ($+1, -1$), which neglects this crucial scaling factor.\n\n3.  **The Role of the Unit Vector $\\vec{n}$:** The condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|=1$) is essential for the simplification $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$. Without this condition, the eigenvalues would be $\\pm \\varepsilon |\\vec{n}|$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical methods and a process of elimination based on the problem's definition lead to the same unambiguous result. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This corresponds to option B.

So, we have $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$. The identity simplifies to:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$. Therefore, we must have:\n        $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    *   Taking the square root gives the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$:\n        $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\n3.  **List of Careful Points and Evaluation of Options:**\n    The reasoning across all candidate answers is remarkably consistent and correct, leading to the result $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to the options being presented in a different order. We must evaluate the options provided in this specific problem context:\n    *   **A) $+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$**: This is incorrect. The Hamiltonian is defined with the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not in the problem definition, it cannot appear in the answer.\n    *   **B) +1, -1**: This is incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself. The Hamiltonian $H$ is scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$, so the eigenvalues must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **C) +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2**: This is incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of the components of the spin operator (e.g., $S_z$). The answer is missing the energy scale $\\varepsilon$ and incorrectly includes $\\hbar$.\n    *   **D) + \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon**: This is correct. It matches our derived result perfectly.

Matching this physical result to the provided options leads to the selection of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$: A constant with the dimension of energy. It acts as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are 2x2 matrices that are fundamental to describing spin-1/2 systems.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Methods of Solution:**\n    The candidate answers demonstrate a consensus on three valid methods to find the eigenvalues.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Most Elegant)**\n        This is the most common method presented. We find the square of the Hamiltonian, $H^2$.\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any unit vector $\\vec{n}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$.\n        This is because $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n}.\\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$. Since $\\vec{n}.\\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$ and $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = 0$, this simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n        Therefore, $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$. The eigenvalues of $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$. Thus, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which gives the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization**\n        This method involves writing the Hamiltonian as a 2x2 matrix and solving the characteristic equation.\n        $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        Solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ leads to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$.\n        Using the unit vector condition $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, the equation becomes $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, which again yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Simplification by Coordinate Choice**\n        Since the eigenvalues are physical quantities, they are independent of the coordinate system. We can choose a system where $\\vec{n}$ points along the z-axis, so $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are $\\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n    All valid methods unanimously conclude that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option C) `+1, -1`.\n\n2.  **The Absence of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This is a common pitfall. This point rules out option A) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2` and option D) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n\n3.  **The Unit Vector Condition:** The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is critical. It is the reason that $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$ and that $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, which simplifies the problem in all methods.\n\n4.  **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers, despite their different final letter choices, show a remarkable consensus in their physical and mathematical reasoning.

Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude squared is $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, the identity simplifies to: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get: $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$.

In this basis, $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n    *   The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}) = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z$.\n    *   The matrix for $\\sigma_z$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The Hamiltonian matrix becomes $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries.\n    *   Thus, the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\nBoth methods, along with the direct matrix diagonalization also shown in many candidate answers, consistently yield the same result.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$.

Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This is a crucial distinction that rules out options B) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2` and C) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|=1$) is essential.

It acts as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are 2x2 matrices, meaning the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 operator and will have two eigenvalues.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a crucial condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Derive the Eigenvalues:** The most elegant and common method, used by nearly all the provided agents, is to square the Hamiltonian operator.\n    *   Let's compute $H^2$:\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is given by $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, the vector is $\\vec{n}$. Applying the identity gives:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$\n    *   Using the condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, we have $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$. The identity simplifies to:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $H^2$. The eigenvalues of the matrix $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian:\n        $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\n3.  **Verification with Alternative Methods:** As shown in several candidate answers, other methods confirm this result.\n    *   **Direct Matrix Calculation:** Writing $H$ as a 2x2 matrix and solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ also yields $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, leading to $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** Since the eigenvalues are independent of the coordinate system, we can choose a basis where $\\vec{n}$ points along the z-axis ($\\vec{n}=(0,0,1)$). The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$, whose eigenvalues are clearly $\\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points and Distractor Analysis\n\nBased on the derivation and the options provided, we can identify several key points that distinguish the correct answer from the distractors.\n\n*   **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ itself has eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out **Option B) +1, -1**.\n*   **The Absence of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined with the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the final answer.

All candidate answers correctly identified and used this property.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical and mathematical methods unanimously lead to the conclusion that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. Comparing this result to the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step evaluation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$: A constant with the dimension of energy. It sets the energy scale of the system.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are 2x2 matrices that are fundamental to the description of spin-1/2 systems.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Derivations:**\n    The candidate answers demonstrate a strong consensus on the correct methods to solve this problem. The two most common and correct approaches are:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian.** This is the most elegant method.\n        *   We compute $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        *   A fundamental property of Pauli matrices is that for any unit vector $\\vec{n}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$. This is because $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n}.\\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $\\vec{n}.\\vec{n}=1$, and since the cross product of a vector with itself is zero, $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n}=0$. This simplifies the expression to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n        *   Substituting this back gives $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. The eigenvalues of $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization.** This method is more explicit and confirms the result.\n        *   The Hamiltonian can be written as the matrix $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   Solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ gives $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$.\n        *   Using the unit vector condition ($n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$), the equation becomes $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$.\n        *   The solutions are the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Results and Identify Careful Points:**\n    All valid methods unanimously lead to the conclusion that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are clearly due to a randomization of the option labels, as the physical reasoning in almost every case is sound and points to the same result.\n\n    Here are the crucial points to consider when evaluating the options:\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$.** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues of $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option D) `+1, -1`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$.** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since $\\hbar$ is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This rules out option B) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2` and option C) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2`.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The Importance of the Unit Vector $\\vec{n}$.** The condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential for the simplification in all derivation methods. It ensures that $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$ and that $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the consistent results from multiple valid derivations and the process of elimination by analyzing the physical dimensions and definitions, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are unambiguously $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the problem and the reasoning presented in the candidate answers to find the consensus on the correct physical result.

It acts as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are 2x2 matrices, so the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 operator and will have two eigenvalues.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Operator Method)**\n    This is the most elegant and common method to solve this problem.\n    *   We start by squaring the Hamiltonian operator: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, the vector is $\\vec{n}$. So, we have $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Using the given condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, we have $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   The identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get: $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$. The eigenvalues of the matrix $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Method 2: Direct Matrix Calculation (Verification)**\n    This method confirms the result from the first method.\n    *   Construct the matrix for $H$: $H = \\varepsilon (n_x \\sigma_x + n_y \\sigma_y + n_z \\sigma_z) = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   Find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n    *   This leads to the equation: $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$.\n    *   Using the unit vector condition $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, the equation becomes $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$.\n    *   The solutions are the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Role of $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option C) `+1, -1` and D) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n*   **The Absence of $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant $\\hbar$ is not present in the problem definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This is a crucial distinction and rules out options B) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2` and D) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n*   **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential for the simplification in both methods. If $\\vec{n}$ were not a unit vector, the eigenvalues would be $\\pm \\varepsilon |\\vec{n}|$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth analytical methods, confirmed by the reasoning in all the provided candidate answers, lead to the same result. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.

It sets the energy scale of the system.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are dimensionless 2x2 matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Consensus on Derivation Method:**\n    The most elegant and widely used method, present in nearly all candidate answers, is to square the Hamiltonian operator.\n    *   Start by squaring H: $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In this problem, the vector is $\\vec{n}$. Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude squared is $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, the identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)I = I$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$ gives: $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Eigenvalues:**\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $H^2$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have the relation $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Taking the square root of both sides yields the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n4.  **Verification with Alternative Methods:**\n    *   **Direct Matrix Calculation:** As shown by many candidate answers, constructing the matrix $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$ and solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ also yields $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, and thus $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n    *   **Symmetry Argument:** Since the eigenvalues are independent of the coordinate system, we can choose a system where $\\vec{n}$ points along the z-axis ($\\vec{n}=(0,0,1)$). The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are $\\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points and Distractor Analysis\n\nAll valid methods unanimously lead to the result that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. We can use this to evaluate the given options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Role of the Energy Constant $\\varepsilon$.** The Hamiltonian is directly proportional to $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, its eigenvalues, which represent the system's energy levels, must also be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This rules out options B) $+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$ and C) +1, -1. Option C represents the eigenvalues of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ without the energy scaling.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Absence of Planck's Constant $\\hbar$.** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.

This rules out options A) $+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$ and B) $+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation and the process of elimination, the only physically and mathematically correct answer is that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This corresponds to option D.

Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which leads directly to the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization.** This involves writing the Hamiltonian as a 2x2 matrix and solving the characteristic equation.\n        *   $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   The characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ becomes $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$.\n        *   Using the unit vector condition $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, the equation simplifies to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, yielding the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Simplification by Coordinate Choice.** Since the eigenvalues are physical quantities, they are independent of the coordinate system.\n        *   We can choose a convenient coordinate system where $\\vec{n}$ points along the z-axis, so $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        *   The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Results and Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Unanimous Result:** All valid physical methods unanimously conclude that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. The reasoning presented in all 15 candidate answers correctly derives this physical result.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Role of $\\varepsilon$.** The Hamiltonian is proportional to the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues, which represent energy, must also be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This rules out options B) `+1, -1` and C) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.

The physical conclusion is the same in all cases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation from multiple standard methods, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$. The candidate answers demonstrate a strong consensus on the derivation, even if their final letter choices vary. The most direct and physically insightful method is to square the Hamiltonian.\n\n1.  **Square the Hamiltonian Operator**:\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $H$. Then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$.\n    $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n\n2.  **Use the Pauli Matrix Identity**:\n    A fundamental property of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of its projection onto the Pauli vector is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix. In this problem, the vector is $\\vec{n}$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Unit Vector Condition**:\n    The problem states that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, which means its magnitude is one: $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    Applying this to the identity gives: $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (1)^2 I = I$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Eigenvalues**:\n    Substituting this result back into the expression for the squared Hamiltonian gives:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    Since $\\lambda^2$ is the eigenvalue of $H^2$, we can equate it to the eigenvalue of $\\varepsilon^2 I$. This gives the simple equation:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    Taking the square root yields the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian:\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThis result is confirmed by all valid methods presented in the candidate answers, including direct matrix diagonalization and simplification by choosing a convenient coordinate system. The energy eigenvalues are therefore $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$**: The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues of +1 and -1. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option C) `+1, -1`.\n\n2.  **The Absence of $\\hbar$**: The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This is a crucial distinction that rules out options A) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2` and D) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n\n3.  **The Unit Vector Condition**: The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential. It allows the simplification of $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$ to the identity matrix, which is the key step in the most elegant derivation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from Analysis**: Based on the derivation and the process of elimination, the only physically and mathematically correct answer is that the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This matches option B. The widespread disagreement on the final letter choice among the candidate answers, despite their correct reasoning, strongly indicates that the option lettering was randomized for them.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step derivation of the physics problem, the following conclusion is reached.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe objective is to find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Hamiltonian:**\n    *   $\\varepsilon$: A constant with the dimension of energy. It serves as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental 2x2 matrices used to describe spin-1/2 systems.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, so $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Summary of Solution Methods:**\n    The candidate answers demonstrate three valid and standard methods for solving this problem, all of which lead to the same result.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian.** This is the most elegant approach. By squaring the Hamiltonian, $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$. Using the fundamental Pauli matrix identity $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$, and the fact that $|\\vec{n}|=1$, we get $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$. Therefore, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization.** This involves writing the Hamiltonian as an explicit 2x2 matrix: $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$. Solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ leads to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$. Using the unit vector condition, this simplifies to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, again yielding $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Simplification by Coordinate Choice.** Since the eigenvalues are physical quantities, they are independent of the choice of coordinate system. We can simplify the problem by aligning the z-axis with the vector $\\vec{n}$, so that $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$. The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are clearly $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The Hamiltonian is directly proportional to the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, its eigenvalues, which represent the system's energy levels, must also be proportional to $\\varepsilon$. This rules out options B (+1, -1) and D (+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2), which lack this dependency. The eigenvalues of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself are $\\pm 1$, but the Hamiltonian scales these by $\\varepsilon$.\n\n2.  **The Absence of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the final answer. This rules out options A ($+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$) and D ($+\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2$).\n\n3.  **The Unit Vector Condition:** The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is essential. It allows the simplification of $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$ to the identity matrix $I$ and ensures that the term $(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)$ equals 1 in the matrix diagonalization method. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid methods of analysis lead to the same unambiguous result: the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on this physical result, with their derivations being almost universally correct.

Let's follow this method.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$.\n    *   We compute $H^2$:\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, the vector is $\\vec{n}$. So, $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$. The identity simplifies to:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Verification with Alternative Methods:** As shown in many candidate answers, other methods confirm this result.\n    *   **Direct Matrix Calculation:** Writing $H$ as the matrix $\\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$ and solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ yields $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, giving $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n    *   **Symmetry/Coordinate Choice:** Since the eigenvalues are independent of the coordinate system, we can choose a simple alignment, such as $\\vec{n}$ along the z-axis ($\\vec{n}=(0,0,1)$). The Hamiltonian becomes $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.

The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This eliminates option C ($+1, -1$), which neglects this crucial scaling factor.\n\n3.  **The Role of the Unit Vector $\\vec{n}$:** The condition that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($|\\vec{n}|=1$) is essential for the simplification $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.

It sets the energy scale of the system, so the eigenvalues (which are energies) must be proportional to $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: This is the vector of Pauli matrices, $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are fundamental operators for a spin-1/2 system.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: This is an arbitrary **unit vector**. This condition is crucial, as it means the magnitude of the vector is one: $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Derive the Eigenvalues:**\n    The most elegant and common method, used by nearly all candidate answers, is to square the Hamiltonian operator.\n    *   Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $H$. Then $\\lambda^2$ must be an eigenvalue of $H^2$.\n    *   We compute $H^2$:\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$\n    *   A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any vector $\\vec{A}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})$ is $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{A})^2 = |\\vec{A}|^2 I$, where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   In our case, the vector is the unit vector $\\vec{n}$. So, we have $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = |\\vec{n}|^2 I$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$. The identity simplifies to:\n        $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$. Therefore, we must have:\n        $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n    *   Taking the square root gives the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$:\n        $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\n3.  **List of Careful Points and Evaluation of Options:**\n    The reasoning across all candidate answers is remarkably consistent and correct, leading to the result $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to the options being presented in a different order. We must evaluate the options provided in this specific problem context:\n    *   **A) $+\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, - \\varepsilon \\hbar/2$**: This is incorrect. The Hamiltonian is defined with the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not in the problem definition, it cannot appear in the answer.\n    *   **B) +1, -1**: This is incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself. The Hamiltonian $H$ is scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$, so the eigenvalues must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$.\n    *   **C) +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2**: This is incorrect. These are the eigenvalues of the components of the spin operator (e.g., $S_z$). The answer is missing the energy scale $\\varepsilon$ and incorrectly includes $\\hbar$.\n    *   **D) + \\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon**: This is correct. It matches our derived result perfectly. The eigenvalues are directly proportional to the energy scale $\\varepsilon$ and do not contain $\\hbar$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll valid physical methods (squaring the Hamiltonian, direct matrix diagonalization, and simplification by choice of coordinates) unanimously show that the eigenvalues of the operator $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This conclusion is supported by the correct reasoning found in all 15 candidate answers. Matching this physical result to the provided options leads to the selection of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and identifying the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Hamiltonian Operator:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$: A constant with the dimension of energy. It acts as a scaling factor for the energy levels.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma}$: The vector of Pauli matrices, $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. These are 2x2 matrices that are fundamental to describing spin-1/2 systems.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$: An arbitrary **unit vector**. This is a critical condition, meaning its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Methods of Solution:**\n    The candidate answers demonstrate a consensus on three valid methods to find the eigenvalues.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Squaring the Hamiltonian (Most Elegant)**\n        This is the most common method presented. We find the square of the Hamiltonian, $H^2$.\n        $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2$.\n        A fundamental identity of the Pauli matrices is that for any unit vector $\\vec{n}$, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})$ is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$.\n        This is because $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n}.\\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}.(\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$. Since $\\vec{n}.\\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$ and $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = 0$, this simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n        Therefore, $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n        If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, then $\\lambda^2$ is an eigenvalue of $H^2$. The eigenvalues of $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$. Thus, $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$, which gives the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct Matrix Diagonalization**\n        This method involves writing the Hamiltonian as a 2x2 matrix and solving the characteristic equation.\n        $H = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\\\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        Solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$ leads to $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 0$.\n        Using the unit vector condition $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, the equation becomes $\\lambda^2 - \\varepsilon^2 = 0$, which again yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Simplification by Coordinate Choice**\n        Since the eigenvalues are physical quantities, they are independent of the coordinate system. We can choose a system where $\\vec{n}$ points along the z-axis, so $\\vec{n} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n        The Hamiltonian simplifies to $H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z = \\varepsilon \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements, which are $\\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n    All valid methods unanimously conclude that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of $\\varepsilon$:** The operator $\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n}$ by itself has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is this operator scaled by the energy constant $\\varepsilon$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $H$ must also be scaled by $\\varepsilon$. This rules out option C) `+1, -1`.\n\n2.  **The Absence of $\\hbar$:** The Hamiltonian is explicitly defined using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma}$, not the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$. Since Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is not present in the problem's definition, it cannot appear in the answer. This is a common pitfall. This point rules out option A) `+εħ/2, -εħ/2` and option D) `+ħ/2, -ħ/2`.\n\n3.  **The Unit Vector Condition:** The fact that $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector is critical. It is the reason that $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$ and that $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, which simplifies the problem in all methods.\n\n4.  **Consensus in Reasoning:** All 15 candidate answers, despite their different final letter choices, show a remarkable consensus in their physical and mathematical reasoning. They all correctly derive the eigenvalues to be $\\pm \\varepsilon$. The variation in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is a clear artifact of the options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\nBased on the unanimous result from all valid derivations and the process of elimination, the correct eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$. This corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a complete consensus on the physical result, despite variations in the final letter chosen.

The identity simplifies to $(\\vec{\\sigma}.\\vec{n})^2 = I$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $H^2$, we get:\n        $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $\\varepsilon^2 I$ are simply $\\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Equating this with our earlier finding, we have $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$.\n    *   Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$: $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Options\n\nBased on the derivation, the eigenvalues are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.
