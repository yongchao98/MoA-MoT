The condition for clearly resolving two states is that their energy difference must be significantly larger than the larger of the two energy widths. I will calculate this minimum required energy difference and then compare it against the given options to find the correct one.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n1.  **State the Governing Principle**: The relationship between a quantum state's lifetime (τ) and the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as its energy width, is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2. For calculations, we'll use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n2.  **Calculate Energy Widths**: I will calculate the energy width for each state using their given lifetimes (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s) and the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n3.  **Determine the Resolution Condition**: To \"clearly resolve\" the two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the energy width of the broader state.

This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) has a fundamental lower limit:\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical calculations, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width, as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nThis relationship implies that a state with a shorter lifetime has a larger, more \"smeared out\" energy level.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\"\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the energy levels will overlap to the point of being indistinguishable.

For calculations, we can approximate the energy width as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: We need to calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their given lifetimes and the value of ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\"**: For two energy levels to be clearly distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the energy levels will overlap and be indistinguishable. The state with the shorter lifetime has the larger energy width, and this width is the primary limiting factor for resolution.\n    *   The larger energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, the condition for resolution is: **|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**: We must compare the given options against this required condition.\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This value is much larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is not resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Inverse Relationship**: The core concept is the inverse relationship between a state's lifetime and its energy uncertainty. The shorter the lifetime, the larger and more \"smeared out\" its energy level becomes.\n*   **The Limiting Factor**: The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) and therefore sets the minimum requirement for resolving the two levels. The energy separation must be greater than this larger width.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\"**: This term implies that the energy separation must be significantly greater than the energy widths, so their probability distributions do not significantly overlap. Only option A (10⁻⁴ eV) is orders of magnitude larger than the required minimum, satisfying this condition.\n*   **Consistency of Analysis**: All candidate answers, despite sometimes having different final letter choices due to shuffled options, correctly identified the physics, performed the calculation, and concluded that the required energy difference must be greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) has a fundamental lower limit:\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical calculations, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width, as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nThis relationship implies that a state with a shorter lifetime has a larger, more \"smeared out\" energy level.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for \"Clearly Resolved\"\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved,\" the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths.
