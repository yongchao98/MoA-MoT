This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene's function by introducing a mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To knock out a gene, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. The general order of severity is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is uncertain and less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is often uncertain.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant:** We will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n        *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the given choices.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The question asks to select the correct option from the list. We must carefully map our conclusion (Mutant 2) to the provided options.\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 3\n    *   C) Mutant 4\n    *   D) Mutant 2\n\n    Our analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identify Mutation Type:** The core of the problem is distinguishing between missense, nonsense, and deletion mutations and understanding their biological consequences.\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is generally more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Pay Close Attention to the Option Mapping:** A common error is to correctly identify the best mutant but select the wrong letter option. The options (A, B, C, D) are not listed in the same order as the mutants (1, 2, 3, 4). It is crucial to match the correct mutant (Mutant 2) to its corresponding letter (D).\n4.  **Reading Frame:** It is essential to correctly identify the start codon (`ATG`) and read the sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides (codons) to determine the amino acid sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a specific gene. The most reliable way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo find the most effective mutation, we must understand how different types of mutations impact protein synthesis and function. The general order from most to least severe is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to produce a severely truncated and non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less predictable.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one altered amino acid, the effect of which is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids, but a loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation for knocking out gene function. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final step is to select the correct letter corresponding to our conclusion. The question provides the following options:\n    *   A) Mutant 3\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 1\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n*   **Final Answer:** The correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B. A common error in the candidate answers was correctly identifying Mutant 2 as the most effective but then selecting the wrong letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, and then to carefully map that mutant to the correct multiple-choice option. To do this, I will write a Python script that translates each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This will allow me to precisely identify the type and severity of each mutation. The most severe mutation, a nonsense mutation that creates a premature stop codon, is the most probable to eliminate the protein's function.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find the mutation that most reliably \"knocks out\" the gene's function. This means we are looking for the most severe mutation.\n2.  **Establish the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** Nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) are generally the most effective at knocking out a gene, as they halt protein synthesis. This is more reliable than missense mutations (amino acid swaps) or in-frame deletions, whose effects can be unpredictable.\n3.  **Translate the DNA Sequences:** I will use a Python script to translate the start of the intact gene and each mutant sequence. This will clearly show the effect of each mutation.\n    *   The intact gene will provide the baseline functional protein sequence.\n    *   Analysis of each mutant will reveal the mutation type (e.g., missense, nonsense).\n4.  **Identify the Best Candidate:** The mutant with the nonsense mutation will be identified as the one most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n5.  **Map to the Correct Option:** I will carefully check the provided options (A, B, C, D) to ensure the correct mutant is mapped to the correct letter. This is a critical step where errors can occur.\n\nBased on this plan, the following Python code will perform the analysis and determine the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mutation_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to find the one most likely to create a non-functional protein,\n    and maps it to the correct multiple-choice answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to map DNA codons to amino acids.

Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to eliminate the function of a gene. This gene produces a protein that, in turn, synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound. Therefore, a \"knockout\" mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein is the desired outcome.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. In general, the most severe mutations are those that cause the most significant disruption to the protein's structure.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon that codes for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. If this happens early in the gene sequence, it results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** This is caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. It alters the entire reading frame from the point of the mutation onwards, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective knockout method.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable and uncertain; it might have no effect, or it might inactivate the protein. It is not as reliable as a nonsense mutation for knocking out function.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is also uncertain and generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant Sequence**\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to see the effect on the protein.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one altered amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to select the option corresponding to the correct mutant:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nOur analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify which of the four mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. To achieve a knockout, the most severe mutations are preferred. The general order of severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees the resulting truncated protein will be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less certain to be a knockout.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n5.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\nThe analysis consistently shows that the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a premature stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reading Frame:** The analysis is critically dependent on starting at the `ATG` codon and reading the DNA sequence in non-overlapping groups of three (codons). All candidate answers did this correctly.\n2.  **Understanding Mutation Types:** The core of the problem is correctly identifying the type of mutation (missense, nonsense, etc.) and its biological consequence. All candidate answers correctly identified the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n3.  **Evaluating Severity:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions. This was the unanimous conclusion of all candidate answers.\n4.  **Mapping the Mutant to the Correct Option Letter:** This is a crucial final step. The question provides the following mapping:\n    *   A) Mutant 3\n    *   B) Mutant 4\n    *   C) Mutant 2\n    *   D) Mutant 1\n\nSince our analysis concludes that **Mutant 2** is the correct answer, we must select the corresponding option letter, which is **C**. Many of the candidate answers failed at this final mapping step, despite having the correct scientific reasoning.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Effect of Different Mutation Types\nTo determine the most effective mutation, we must understand the potential impact of different genetic changes on the final protein product. The severity of mutations, in terms of causing a loss of function, can be ranked as follows:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This mutation changes a codon that specifies an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a severely shortened (truncated) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most reliable method for gene knockout among the choices.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This involves an insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very severe and effective knockout mutation.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This involves the removal or addition of one or more full codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is less predictable and less likely to be a complete knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** This mutation substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might inactivate the protein, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a reliable method for knocking out a gene.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Specific Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of the intact gene and each mutant sequence to observe the effect of the mutation. The reading frame begins with the start codon `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed, which is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\n1.  **Biological Conclusion:** The analysis consistently shows that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome. All 15 candidate answers correctly reached this same biological conclusion.\n\n2.  **Mapping to the Correct Option (Careful Point):** The most critical step is to correctly map the biological conclusion (Mutant 2) to the corresponding lettered option. The question provides an explicit list:\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\n    Many of the candidate answers, despite having correct scientific reasoning, failed at this final step and chose an incorrect letter. Based on the explicit mapping provided in the question, the correct choice for Mutant 2 is **B**.\n\n3.  **Final Decision:** The scientific evidence overwhelmingly points to Mutant 2. The question explicitly maps Mutant 2 to option B. Therefore, B is the correct final answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Mutation\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on the final protein. In terms of causing a complete loss of function, the general hierarchy from most to least severe is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to produce a non-functional, truncated protein.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not as reliable for knocking out a gene as a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid and is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed, but this is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\n1.  **Scientific Conclusion:** The scientific analysis unanimously points to **Mutant 2** as the most effective choice. The introduction of a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) so early in the gene sequence is the most reliable method among the options for ensuring the resulting protein is non-functional.\n2.  **Mapping to the Correct Option (Critical Point):** The final step is to match the correct mutant to the corresponding lettered option from the question. This was a common point of error in the candidate answers. The options provided in the question are:\n    *   A) Mutant 4\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 1\n\nSince our analysis concluded that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, we must select the option that corresponds to it.\n\nBased on the list, **Mutant 2 is option B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Experiment\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a barley cultivar. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\" We need to identify which of the four mutant sequences is most likely to achieve this.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene and the Basics of Protein Synthesis\nProtein synthesis (translation) begins at a start codon (`ATG`) and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence (start):** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` = Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation\nWe must analyze each mutant to determine the type of mutation and its probable effect on the protein. The most severe mutations are those that halt protein synthesis or scramble the entire amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it, as the full-length protein is still produced.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation will cause protein synthesis to terminate prematurely after only two amino acids have been joined. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This product is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two substitutions: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this alters the protein but does not ensure it will be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Analysis Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Hierarchy of Severity:** The key is to recognize that a nonsense mutation occurring early in a gene is more likely to cause a complete loss of function than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n    2.  **Reading Frame:** The analysis depends on correctly identifying the start codon (`ATG`) and reading the sequence in non-overlapping triplets.\n    3.  **Codon Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify `TAA` as a stop codon, which is the definitive feature of Mutant 2.\n    4.  **Mapping to Options:** The final step is to map the correct mutant to the corresponding letter in the multiple-choice list. The analysis identifies Mutant 2 as the answer, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer Selection:**\nThe analysis clearly shows that Mutant 2 is the most effective choice. According to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Scientific Question\nThe fundamental task is to determine which of the four given mutations is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein will not be able to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound, thus achieving the desired outcome.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects\nTo solve this, one must understand the hierarchy of how different mutations affect protein function:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the gene, it is the most reliable way to produce a non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not guaranteed to be a knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Sequence\nLet's analyze each mutant by comparing it to the intact gene and translating the codons. The reading frame starts with `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** (This is the functional protein).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. The functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (an **in-frame deletion**). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and therefore the most likely to eliminate the protein's function. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\n### Step 5: Final Check on Options\nThe final step is to map the correct mutant to the correct lettered option. The question provides the following mapping:\n*   **A) Mutant 2**\n*   B) Mutant 1\n*   C) Mutant 3\n*   D) Mutant 4\n\nSince the analysis consistently shows that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, and Mutant 2 is listed as option A, the final answer must be A. Many of the candidate answers performed the biological analysis correctly but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Genetic Modification\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene and the Principle of Translation\nProtein synthesis (translation) begins at the `ATG` start codon and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon specifies an amino acid.\n\n*   **Intact Gene (first few codons):** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT`...-3’\n*   **Translated Protein (start):** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala`...\nThis is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Effect of Each Mutation\nWe need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein. The hierarchy of mutation severity, in terms of causing a loss of function, is generally:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation (most severe):** Creates a premature stop codon, halting protein synthesis.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation (very severe):** Alters the entire downstream reading frame.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds amino acids but preserves the reading frame.\n4.  **Missense Mutation (variable effect):** Substitutes one amino acid for another.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT`...-3’\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT`...-3’\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after only the second amino acid. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and a complete loss of function is not certain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed), so the reading frame is preserved. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a premature stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Identifying the Goal:** The key is to find the mutation most likely to cause a complete loss of function, not just a minor change.\n2.  **Ranking Mutation Severity:** A nonsense mutation early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is more definitive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Mapping Mutant to Option:** The final and most crucial step is to correctly map the identified mutant to its corresponding letter in the options list. The analysis shows **Mutant 2** is the correct answer. The options provided are:\n    A) Mutant 4\n    B) Mutant 1\n    C) Mutant 2\n    D) Mutant 3\n\n    Therefore, Mutant 2 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on the final protein product. The most severe mutations are those that prevent a full-length, functional protein from being synthesized.\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (e.g., `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate a protein's function is to introduce a nonsense or frameshift mutation early in its sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. **This is the most effective knockout mutation.**\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations**. It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids, but the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration, but less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nThe analysis clearly shows that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow, we must map this conclusion to the given options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 3\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct answer, the corresponding option is **A**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Core Biological Principle:** The key is understanding that a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) early in a gene is the most reliable way to produce a non-functional protein compared to missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n*   **Accurate Translation:** Correctly identifying the codons (`ATG`, `TTT`, `CTC`, etc.) and their corresponding amino acids or signals (like the `TAA` stop codon) is essential.\n*   **Attention to Detail:** The most critical step, where many of the candidate answers failed, is correctly matching the scientifically correct answer (Mutant 2) with the corresponding lettered option from the question's list. In this case, Mutant 2 is explicitly listed as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on protein function. The most reliable way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that causes a major disruption. The general order of severity is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees a non-functional, truncated protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective type of mutation for this goal.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration but is less reliable for knocking out function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Correct Biological Reasoning:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n*   **Careful Point - Option Mapping:** The most critical step is to map the correct mutant to the correct letter option provided in the question. The question states the options are:\n    *   A) Mutant 3\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 1\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n*   **Final Decision:** Our analysis concluded that **Mutant 2** is the correct choice. According to the provided list, Mutant 2 corresponds to option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. In terms of producing a non-functional protein, the general order from most to least effective is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to produce a non-functional protein.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually resulting in a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** where Leucine (`CTC`) is replaced by Tyrosine (`TAC`). The protein is still produced at full length, and its loss of function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon for Leucine (`CTC`) has been changed to a **stop codon** (`TAA`). This will halt protein synthesis after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutation involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (a **missense mutation**) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (an **in-frame deletion**). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **The Goal:** The key is to find the mutation *most likely* to cause a loss of function. This requires comparing the severity of different mutation types, not just identifying that a change has occurred.\n2.  **Reading Frame:** The analysis is critically dependent on starting at `ATG` and reading the DNA sequence in non-overlapping triplets (codons).\n3.  **Codon Recognition:** It is essential to recognize that `TAA` is a stop codon, while the other changes result in amino acid substitutions or deletions.\n4.  **Impact Assessment:** A premature stop codon early in the gene is fundamentally more disruptive than changing one or two amino acids (missense) or removing one amino acid without altering the reading frame (in-frame deletion).\n5.  **Mapping to Options:** After concluding that Mutant 2 is the correct scientific answer, it must be mapped to the corresponding letter from the question's options. The question provides the following mapping:\n    *   **A) Mutant 2**\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 4\n    *   D) Mutant 3\n\nBased on this mapping, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which mutation will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to find the mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. The most severe mutations are those that prevent the formation of a full-length, functional protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting truncated protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most reliable way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is uncertain and can range from negligible to a complete loss of function. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is also uncertain.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nThe genetic code is read in three-base codons starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** where the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed, which is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This involves a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation presented. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reading Frame:** The analysis must begin at the `ATG` start codon and proceed in non-overlapping triplets.\n2.  **Accurately Classifying the Mutation Type:** It is essential to distinguish between missense, nonsense, and deletion mutations to understand their biological consequences. The key is identifying the `CTC` to `TAA` change in Mutant 2 as a nonsense mutation.\n3.  **Understanding the Biological Impact:** The central concept is that a premature stop codon early in a gene is the most reliable method among the choices for creating a non-functional protein.\n4.  **Mapping the Correct Mutant to the Lettered Option:** A critical final step is to carefully read the question's options. The question explicitly lists the choices as:\n    A) Mutant 1\n    B) Mutant 4\n    C) Mutant 3\n    D) Mutant 2\n    Our analysis concluded that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Goal of the Experiment\nThe primary objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Types of Mutations by Severity\nTo achieve a gene knockout, we must identify the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein. The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Gene Sequence\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n    *   This is the baseline functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`).

This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, it guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Understanding the Biological Goal:** The key is to identify the mutation most likely to cause a complete *loss of function* of the protein, not just any change.\n2.  **Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** It is crucial to recognize that a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) is generally the most effective way to knock out a gene's function compared to missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Identifying the Stop Codon:** The analysis hinges on recognizing that the `TAA` sequence in Mutant 2 is a stop codon, which terminates protein synthesis.\n4.  **Mapping the Mutant to the Option:** After determining that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, it is essential to map it to the corresponding letter choice provided in the question.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which of the four mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. To achieve a knockout, the most severe mutations are preferred. The general order of severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees the resulting truncated protein will be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less certain to be a knockout.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\nThe analysis consistently shows that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a premature stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reading Frame:** The analysis is critically dependent on starting at the `ATG` codon and reading the DNA sequence in non-overlapping groups of three (codons).\n2.  **Understanding Mutation Types:** The core of the problem is correctly identifying the type of mutation (missense, nonsense, etc.) and its biological consequence.\n3.  **Evaluating Severity:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n4.  **Mapping the Mutant to the Correct Option Letter:** This is a crucial final step. The question provides the following mapping:\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 4\n    *   **C) Mutant 2**\n    *   D) Mutant 3\n\nSince our analysis concludes that **Mutant 2** is the correct answer, we must select the corresponding option letter, which is **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>",

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene's function by introducing a mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To knock out a gene, the most effective mutations are those that cause the most severe disruption to the protein. The general order of severity is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is a highly effective knockout strategy.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is uncertain and less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not inactivate the protein. The effect is often uncertain.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant:** We will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n        *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   **Translation:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the given choices.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The question asks to select the correct option from the list. We must carefully map our conclusion (Mutant 2) to the provided options.\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 3\n    *   C) Mutant 4\n    *   D) Mutant 2\n\n    Our analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identify Mutation Type:** The core of the problem is distinguishing between missense, nonsense, and deletion mutations and understanding their biological consequences.\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is generally more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Pay Close Attention to the Option Mapping:** A common error is to correctly identify the best mutant but select the wrong letter option. The options (A, B, C, D) are not listed in the same order as the mutants (1, 2, 3, 4). It is crucial to match the correct mutant (Mutant 2) to its corresponding letter (D).\n4.  **Reading Frame:** It is essential to correctly identify the start codon (`ATG`) and read the sequence in non-overlapping groups of three nucleotides (codons) to determine the amino acid sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a specific gene. The most reliable way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo find the most effective mutation, we must understand how different types of mutations impact protein synthesis and function. The general order from most to least severe is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to produce a severely truncated and non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases).

The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant**\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one altered amino acid, the effect of which is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids, but a loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. While disruptive, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation for knocking out gene function. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** The final step is to select the correct letter corresponding to our conclusion. The question provides the following options:\n    *   A) Mutant 3\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 1\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n*   **Final Answer:** The correct choice is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option B. A common error in the candidate answers was correctly identifying Mutant 2 as the most effective but then selecting the wrong letter.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, and then to carefully map that mutant to the correct multiple-choice option. To do this, I will write a Python script that translates each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. This will allow me to precisely identify the type and severity of each mutation. The most severe mutation, a nonsense mutation that creates a premature stop codon, is the most probable to eliminate the protein's function.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find the mutation that most reliably \"knocks out\" the gene's function. This means we are looking for the most severe mutation.\n2.  **Establish the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** Nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) are generally the most effective at knocking out a gene, as they halt protein synthesis. This is more reliable than missense mutations (amino acid swaps) or in-frame deletions, whose effects can be unpredictable.\n3.  **Translate the DNA Sequences:** I will use a Python script to translate the start of the intact gene and each mutant sequence. This will clearly show the effect of each mutation.\n    *   The intact gene will provide the baseline functional protein sequence.\n    *   Analysis of each mutant will reveal the mutation type (e.g., missense, nonsense).\n4.  **Identify the Best Candidate:** The mutant with the nonsense mutation will be identified as the one most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n5.  **Map to the Correct Option:** I will carefully check the provided options (A, B, C, D) to ensure the correct mutant is mapped to the correct letter. This is a critical step where errors can occur.\n\nBased on this plan, the following Python code will perform the analysis and determine the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mutation_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to find the one most likely to create a non-functional protein,\n    and maps it to the correct multiple-choice answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to map DNA codons to amino acids.

Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to eliminate the function of a gene. This gene produces a protein that, in turn, synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound. Therefore, a \"knockout\" mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein is the desired outcome.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. In general, the most severe mutations are those that cause the most significant disruption to the protein's structure.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon that codes for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. If this happens early in the gene sequence, it results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a highly effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** This is caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. It alters the entire reading frame from the point of the mutation onwards, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective knockout method.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable and uncertain; it might have no effect, or it might inactivate the protein. It is not as reliable as a nonsense mutation for knocking out function.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is also uncertain and generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant Sequence**\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to see the effect on the protein.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one altered amino acid. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation among the choices. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe question asks to select the option corresponding to the correct mutant:\nA) Mutant 1\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 2\n\nOur analysis shows that Mutant 2 is the correct choice, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify which of the four mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. To achieve a knockout, the most severe mutations are preferred. The general order of severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees the resulting truncated protein will be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less certain to be a knockout.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n5.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\nThe analysis consistently shows that the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a premature stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reading Frame:** The analysis is critically dependent on starting at the `ATG` codon and reading the DNA sequence in non-overlapping groups of three (codons). All candidate answers did this correctly.\n2.  **Understanding Mutation Types:** The core of the problem is correctly identifying the type of mutation (missense, nonsense, etc.) and its biological consequence. All candidate answers correctly identified the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n3.  **Evaluating Severity:** A nonsense mutation that occurs early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is more disruptive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions. This was the unanimous conclusion of all candidate answers.\n4.  **Mapping the Mutant to the Correct Option Letter:** This is a crucial final step. The question provides the following mapping:\n    *   A) Mutant 3\n    *   B) Mutant 4\n    *   C) Mutant 2\n    *   D) Mutant 1\n\nSince our analysis concludes that **Mutant 2** is the correct answer, we must select the corresponding option letter, which is **C**. Many of the candidate answers failed at this final mapping step, despite having the correct scientific reasoning.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe primary objective is to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Effect of Different Mutation Types\nTo determine the most effective mutation, we must understand the potential impact of different genetic changes on the final protein product. The severity of mutations, in terms of causing a loss of function, can be ranked as follows:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This mutation changes a codon that specifies an amino acid into a \"stop\" codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a severely shortened (truncated) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most reliable method for gene knockout among the choices.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This involves an insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also a very severe and effective knockout mutation.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This involves the removal or addition of one or more full codons (a multiple of three nucleotides). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is less predictable and less likely to be a complete knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** This mutation substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might inactivate the protein, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a reliable method for knocking out a gene.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Specific Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of the intact gene and each mutant sequence to observe the effect of the mutation. The reading frame begins with the start codon `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed, which is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the `GGT` codon is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\n1.  **Biological Conclusion:** The analysis consistently shows that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome. All 15 candidate answers correctly reached this same biological conclusion.\n\n2.  **Mapping to the Correct Option (Careful Point):** The most critical step is to correctly map the biological conclusion (Mutant 2) to the corresponding lettered option. The question provides an explicit list:\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\n    Many of the candidate answers, despite having correct scientific reasoning, failed at this final step and chose an incorrect letter. Based on the explicit mapping provided in the question, the correct choice for Mutant 2 is **B**.\n\n3.  **Final Decision:** The scientific evidence overwhelmingly points to Mutant 2. The question explicitly maps Mutant 2 to option B. Therefore, B is the correct final answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Mutation\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on the final protein. In terms of causing a complete loss of function, the general hierarchy from most to least severe is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to produce a non-functional, truncated protein.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not as reliable for knocking out a gene as a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence by reading it in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It changes one amino acid and is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed, but this is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\n1.  **Scientific Conclusion:** The scientific analysis unanimously points to **Mutant 2** as the most effective choice. The introduction of a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) so early in the gene sequence is the most reliable method among the options for ensuring the resulting protein is non-functional.\n2.  **Mapping to the Correct Option (Critical Point):** The final step is to match the correct mutant to the corresponding lettered option from the question. This was a common point of error in the candidate answers. The options provided in the question are:\n    *   A) Mutant 4\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 1\n\nSince our analysis concluded that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, we must select the option that corresponds to it.\n\nBased on the list, **Mutant 2 is option B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Experiment\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a barley cultivar. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\" We need to identify which of the four mutant sequences is most likely to achieve this.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene and the Basics of Protein Synthesis\nProtein synthesis (translation) begins at a start codon (`ATG`) and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence (start):** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Translation into Amino Acids:**\n    *   `ATG` = Methionine (Met) - Start\n    *   `TTT` = Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` = Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` = Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` = Glycine (Gly)\n*   **Resulting Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation\nWe must analyze each mutant to determine the type of mutation and its probable effect on the protein. The most severe mutations are those that halt protein synthesis or scramble the entire amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it, as the full-length protein is still produced.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This mutation will cause protein synthesis to terminate prematurely after only two amino acids have been joined. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe) instead of a full protein. This product is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence contains two substitutions: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this alters the protein but does not ensure it will be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Change:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Analysis Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  **Hierarchy of Severity:** The key is to recognize that a nonsense mutation occurring early in a gene is more likely to cause a complete loss of function than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n    2.  **Reading Frame:** The analysis depends on correctly identifying the start codon (`ATG`) and reading the sequence in non-overlapping triplets.\n    3.  **Codon Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify `TAA` as a stop codon, which is the definitive feature of Mutant 2.\n    4.  **Mapping to Options:** The final step is to map the correct mutant to the corresponding letter in the multiple-choice list. The analysis identifies Mutant 2 as the answer, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer Selection:**\nThe analysis clearly shows that Mutant 2 is the most effective choice. According to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Scientific Question\nThe fundamental task is to determine which of the four given mutations is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein will not be able to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound, thus achieving the desired outcome.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Effects\nTo solve this, one must understand the hierarchy of how different mutations affect protein function:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the gene, it is the most reliable way to produce a non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not guaranteed to be a knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Sequence\nLet's analyze each mutant by comparing it to the intact gene and translating the codons. The reading frame starts with `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** (This is the functional protein).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. The functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids. The functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This has a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (an **in-frame deletion**). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude\nAll candidate answers correctly identify that the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and therefore the most likely to eliminate the protein's function. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\n### Step 5: Final Check on Options\nThe final step is to map the correct mutant to the correct lettered option. The question provides the following mapping:\n*   **A) Mutant 2**\n*   B) Mutant 1\n*   C) Mutant 3\n*   D) Mutant 4\n\nSince the analysis consistently shows that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, and Mutant 2 is listed as option A, the final answer must be A. Many of the candidate answers performed the biological analysis correctly but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Genetic Modification\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, effectively \"knocking out\" the gene's function.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene and the Principle of Translation\nProtein synthesis (translation) begins at the `ATG` start codon and reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon specifies an amino acid.\n\n*   **Intact Gene (first few codons):** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT`...-3’\n*   **Translated Protein (start):** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala`...\nThis is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Effect of Each Mutation\nWe need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein. The hierarchy of mutation severity, in terms of causing a loss of function, is generally:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation (most severe):** Creates a premature stop codon, halting protein synthesis.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation (very severe):** Alters the entire downstream reading frame.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds amino acids but preserves the reading frame.\n4.  **Missense Mutation (variable effect):** Substitutes one amino acid for another.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT`...-3’\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT`...-3’\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause protein synthesis to stop after only the second amino acid. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein, and a complete loss of function is not certain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed), so the reading frame is preserved. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant change, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. By introducing a premature stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Identifying the Goal:** The key is to find the mutation most likely to cause a complete loss of function, not just a minor change.\n2.  **Ranking Mutation Severity:** A nonsense mutation early in the gene is the most reliable way to create a non-functional protein among the given choices. It is more definitive than missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Mapping Mutant to Option:** The final and most crucial step is to correctly map the identified mutant to its corresponding letter in the options list. The analysis shows **Mutant 2** is the correct answer. The options provided are:\n    A) Mutant 4\n    B) Mutant 1\n    C) Mutant 2\n    D) Mutant 3\n\n    Therefore, Mutant 2 corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on the final protein product. The most severe mutations are those that prevent a full-length, functional protein from being synthesized.\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (e.g., `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate a protein's function is to introduce a nonsense or frameshift mutation early in its sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** (`CTC` for Leucine changes to `TAC` for Tyrosine). It produces a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. **This is the most effective knockout mutation.**\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations**. It produces a full-length protein with two altered amino acids, but the functional outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration, but less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\nThe analysis clearly shows that the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and predictable. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, guaranteeing the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow, we must map this conclusion to the given options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 3\n\nSince Mutant 2 is the correct answer, the corresponding option is **A**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Core Biological Principle:** The key is understanding that a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) early in a gene is the most reliable way to produce a non-functional protein compared to missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n*   **Accurate Translation:** Correctly identifying the codons (`ATG`, `TTT`, `CTC`, etc.) and their corresponding amino acids or signals (like the `TAA` stop codon) is essential.\n*   **Attention to Detail:** The most critical step, where many of the candidate answers failed, is correctly matching the scientifically correct answer (Mutant 2) with the corresponding lettered option from the question's list. In this case, Mutant 2 is explicitly listed as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation is one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on protein function. The most reliable way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that causes a major disruption. The general order of severity is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it almost guarantees a non-functional, truncated protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective type of mutation for this goal.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration but is less reliable for knocking out function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Correct Biological Reasoning:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n*   **Careful Point - Option Mapping:** The most critical step is to map the correct mutant to the correct letter option provided in the question. The question states the options are:\n    *   A) Mutant 3\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 1\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n*   **Final Decision:** Our analysis concluded that **Mutant 2** is the correct choice. According to the provided list, Mutant 2 corresponds to option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective mutation will be one that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nDifferent types of mutations have varying impacts on protein function. In terms of producing a non-functional protein, the general order from most to least effective is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this occurs early in the gene, it is almost guaranteed to produce a non-functional protein.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a number not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually resulting in a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** where Leucine (`CTC`) is replaced by Tyrosine (`TAC`). The protein is still produced at full length, and its loss of function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon for Leucine (`CTC`) has been changed to a **stop codon** (`TAA`). This will halt protein synthesis after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n    *   **Analysis:** This mutation involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (a **missense mutation**) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon (an **in-frame deletion**). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and predictable mutation. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This makes it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **The Goal:** The key is to find the mutation *most likely* to cause a loss of function. This requires comparing the severity of different mutation types, not just identifying that a change has occurred.\n2.  **Reading Frame:** The analysis is critically dependent on starting at `ATG` and reading the DNA sequence in non-overlapping triplets (codons).\n3.  **Codon Recognition:** It is essential to recognize that `TAA` is a stop codon, while the other changes result in amino acid substitutions or deletions.\n4.  **Impact Assessment:** A premature stop codon early in the gene is fundamentally more disruptive than changing one or two amino acids (missense) or removing one amino acid without altering the reading frame (in-frame deletion).\n5.  **Mapping to Options:** After concluding that Mutant 2 is the correct scientific answer, it must be mapped to the corresponding letter from the question's options. The question provides the following mapping:\n    *   **A) Mutant 2**\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 4\n    *   D) Mutant 3\n\nBased on this mapping, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to identify which mutation will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound.

This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is also uncertain.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Intact Gene and Each Mutant\nThe genetic code is read in three-base codons starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n    *   This is the functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **missense mutation** where the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed, which is not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide that will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein with an uncertain functional outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Analysis:** This involves a **missense mutation** (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` for Glycine is removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another substituted. This is a significant alteration, but it is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation presented. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Reading Frame:** The analysis must begin at the `ATG` start codon and proceed in non-overlapping triplets.\n2.  **Accurately Classifying the Mutation Type:** It is essential to distinguish between missense, nonsense, and deletion mutations to understand their biological consequences. The key is identifying the `CTC` to `TAA` change in Mutant 2 as a nonsense mutation.\n3.  **Understanding the Biological Impact:** The central concept is that a premature stop codon early in a gene is the most reliable method among the choices for creating a non-functional protein.\n4.  **Mapping the Correct Mutant to the Lettered Option:** A critical final step is to carefully read the question's options. The question explicitly lists the choices as:\n    A) Mutant 1\n    B) Mutant 4\n    C) Mutant 3\n    D) Mutant 2\n    Our analysis concluded that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Goal of the Experiment\nThe primary objective is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional protein, a process known as a \"gene knockout.\"\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Types of Mutations by Severity\nTo achieve a gene knockout, we must identify the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the protein. The general hierarchy of mutation severity, from most to least disruptive, is:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid codon to a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Deletes or adds one or more full codons (a multiple of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. The effect is variable and less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Gene Sequence\nWe will translate the beginning of each DNA sequence, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...`\n    *   This is the baseline functional protein that needs to be inactivated.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with one amino acid changed. This is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`), which will be non-functional. This is the most effective and probable mutation to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: This sequence contains two **missense mutations** (`CTC` to `TAC` and `ACT` to `GTC`). While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it still produces a full-length protein and is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Analysis: Comparing this to the intact gene (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`. This is a combination of a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (3 bases removed). The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another changed. This is a significant alteration but is less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe type of mutation among the choices. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence, it guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Understanding the Biological Goal:** The key is to identify the mutation most likely to cause a complete *loss of function* of the protein, not just any change.\n2.  **Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** It is crucial to recognize that a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) is generally the most effective way to knock out a gene's function compared to missense mutations or in-frame deletions.\n3.  **Identifying the Stop Codon:** The analysis hinges on recognizing that the `TAA` sequence in Mutant 2 is a stop codon, which terminates protein synthesis.\n4.  **Mapping the Mutant to the Option:** After determining that Mutant 2 is the correct answer, it is essential to map it to the corresponding letter choice provided in the question.
