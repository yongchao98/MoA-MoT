The very broad FTIR peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. This is strongly confirmed by the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion. The presence of a carboxylic acid requires the molecule to have at least two oxygen atoms.\n\nAdditionally, the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the mention of vinyl-hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nA molecule containing one C=O bond (in the acid) and one C=C bond must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **C6H12O** and **C6H10O**: These are eliminated because they only have one oxygen and cannot be carboxylic acids.\n*   **C6H12O2**: This formula has two oxygens, but its DoU is `6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1`. This is not enough to accommodate both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2**: This formula has two oxygens, allowing for a carboxylic acid. Its DoU is `6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2`. This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, C6H10O2 is the only formula that fits all the experimental evidence.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the unknown compound by systematically applying constraints derived from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with the four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H12O, and C6H10O2.\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Carboxylic Acid):** The evidence for a carboxylic acid group (FTIR peaks at 3000 and 1700 cm⁻¹, mass spec fragment at m/z=45) requires the molecule to have two oxygen atoms. This constraint eliminated C6H10O and C6H12O, leaving C6H12O2 and C6H10O2 as possibilities.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The evidence for both a carbonyl (C=O) and a vinyl group (C=C) requires a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2. The script calculated the DoU for the remaining candidates:\n    *   C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is insufficient. It was eliminated.\n    *   C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which perfectly matches the presence of one C=O and one C=C bond.\n4.  **Final Choice:** C6H10O2 was the only formula to satisfy all experimental constraints, making it the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
