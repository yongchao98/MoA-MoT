    "This plan outlines the process of identifying the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials by systematically eliminating incorrect options based on fundamental physics principles.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The four options (A, B, C, D) provided in the question will be treated as the initial set of candidate hypotheses. Each hypothesis consists of a pair of expressions for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A).\n*   **Constraint Application & Pruning:**\n    *   **Constraint 1 (General Form):** The potentials for a moving charge must depend on its velocity, $\\vec{v}$. The static form of the potential, $V \\propto 1/r$, is only valid for a stationary charge or as a low-velocity approximation. Hypotheses that use the static potential form for a general moving charge will be pruned.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Denominator Sign):** The derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations shows that the denominator includes a corrective term of the form $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. The negative sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect on the potential due to the motion of the source. Hypotheses with an incorrect sign will be pruned.\n    *   **Constraint 3 (Dimensional Consistency):** The vector potential $\\vec{A}$ must be a vector quantity. Any expression that equates a vector to a scalar is dimensionally incorrect and will be pruned.\n*   **Selection:** The single hypothesis that survives all constraints will be selected as the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef solve_potentials_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Liénard-Wiechert potentials problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Store the original stdout\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    # Redirect stdout to a string buffer\n    sys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\n    # 1.

The solution proceeds by eliminating incorrect options based on established physical laws.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The four options (A, B, C, D) are the starting candidates.\n2.  **Pruning with Constraint 1 (General Form):** The potentials for a charge in arbitrary motion are not described by the simple static Coulomb potential ($V \\propto 1/r$). The potential must account for the charge's velocity. Options C and D use the static form for the scalar potential, making them incorrect for the general case. They are therefore pruned.\n3.  **Pruning with Constraint 2 (Denominator Sign):** The correct derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations yields a denominator of the form $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This specific form, with a negative sign, accounts for the propagation delay (retarded time) and the motion of the source. Option A has a positive sign ($(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$), which is incorrect. It is pruned.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Option B is the only hypothesis that remains. It correctly represents the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, with the proper dependence on velocity and the correct sign in the denominator. The relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ also holds for option B, as $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge by systematically applying physical constraints to a set of hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The four options (A, B, C, D) were established as the initial set of candidates.\n2.  **Constraint Application & Pruning:**\n    *   The first constraint applied was that the potential for a moving charge must depend on its velocity and cannot be the simple static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$). This correctly eliminated options C and D, which are only valid for a stationary charge.\n    *   The second constraint focused on the remaining candidates, A and B. The correct derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations shows that the denominator contains the term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. The negative sign is crucial. This constraint eliminated option A, which incorrectly used a positive sign.\n3.  **Final Selection:** Option B was the only candidate to survive all constraints. It represents the standard, correct form for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The script also correctly noted that the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ holds for option B, given that $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
