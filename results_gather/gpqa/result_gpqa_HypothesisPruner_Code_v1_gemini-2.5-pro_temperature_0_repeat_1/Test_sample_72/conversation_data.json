Only hypothesis A matches both calculated values.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by enumerating the four given options as hypotheses. It then applied the constraints derived from the laws of special relativity.\n\nFirst, it calculated the relative speed using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)`, which yielded approximately `0.143c`.\n\nSecond, it calculated the total energy of the system by summing the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts, `E_total = γ1*m1*c^2 + γ2*m2*c^2`. This calculation resulted in a total energy of approximately `5.964 mc^2`.\n\nBy comparing these calculated values to the initial hypotheses, the script filtered out all options except for one. The surviving candidate, Option A, had values (`v_rel = 0.14c`, `E = 5.96 mc^2`) that closely matched the calculated results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
