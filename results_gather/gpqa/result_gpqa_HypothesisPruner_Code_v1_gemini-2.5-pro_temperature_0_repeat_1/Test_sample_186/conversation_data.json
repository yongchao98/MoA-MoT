    "An brief plan to solve the problem is as follows:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** Define each star (a-f) as a candidate hypothesis. For stars (c-f), calculate their apparent V magnitude (m_V) from the given absolute V magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Observability):** Paranal Observatory is at latitude ~-24.6 degrees. Stars with very high northern declinations (like Polaris at ~+90 deg) are not visible. A generous limit for observability is DEC < +30 degrees. This will be the first filter.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Detectability):** The ESPRESSO performance table (from the provided URL) indicates that in 1-UT mode (one 8m telescope), a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure for stars as faint as V ≈ 19.0 mag (for a G2V star). Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude `m_V < 19.0` will be considered detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Count the number of hypotheses that satisfy both constraints and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, distance_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude (m_V) from absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance in parsecs.\"\"\"\n    # Distance modulus formula: m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    # or m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10)\n    if distance_pc <= 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(distance_pc / 10)\n\n# --- 1.

    "The script successfully determined which of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory.\n\nFirst, the apparent magnitudes for the hypothetical stars (c, d, e, f) were calculated using the distance modulus formula. The initial list of candidates with their key properties (apparent magnitude and declination) was:\n*   a) Canopus: V = -0.74, DEC = -52.7°\n*   b) Polaris: V = 1.98, DEC = +89.3°\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: V = 15.00, DEC = 0°\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: V = 21.51, DEC = 0°\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: V = 13.49, DEC = 0°\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: V = 18.49, DEC = 0°\n\nNext, two constraints were applied to prune this list:\n1.  **Observability Constraint:** Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere, so stars with very high northern declinations are not visible. Using a practical limit of DEC < +30°, Polaris was pruned.\n2.  **Detectability Constraint:** To achieve a S/N of 10 in one hour, a star must be brighter than an apparent magnitude of V ≈ 19.0. This pruned the star at 200 pc, which has a calculated magnitude of V ≈ 21.51.\n\nThe stars that survived both constraints are:\n*   **Canopus:** Observable and very bright.\n*   **Star at 10 pc:** Observable and bright enough (V=15.0).\n*   **Star at 5 pc:** Observable and bright enough (V=13.49).\n*   **Star at 50 pc:** Observable and just bright enough (V=18.49).\n\nThis results in a total of 4 detectable stars, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
