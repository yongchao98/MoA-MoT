The script correctly identified 'B' as the final choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully calculated the required physical quantities to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, it determined the rest-mass energies of the two fragments based on the given conditions: the more massive fragment (`m1`) has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV, and the lighter fragment (`m2`) has a rest-mass energy of 99 GeV. The total kinetic energy released in the fission (`Q`) was calculated as the difference between the initial rest-mass energy (300 GeV) and the sum of the final rest-mass energies (297 GeV), resulting in `Q = 3 GeV`.\n\nNext, the script calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using two different models:\n1.  **Classical Approximation:** `T1_classical` was found to be 1000 MeV.\n2.  **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct `T1_relativistic` was found to be 1005 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`. This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
