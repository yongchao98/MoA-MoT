Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, the Pauli Exclusion Principle applies, meaning each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\n2.  **Ground State:** To find the lowest total energy, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels.\n    *   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (Energy = `1²E = E`).\n    *   The next two particles go into the `n=2` level (Energy = `2²E = 4E`).\n    *   Total Ground State Energy = `2 * E_1 + 2 * E_2 = 2 * (1E) + 2 * (4E) = 10E`.\n\n3.  **First Excited State:** To find the next lowest energy, we promote one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n    *   The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total First Excited State Energy = `2 * E_1 + 1 * E_2 + 1 * E_3 = 2 * (1E) + 1 * (4E) + 1 * (9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n4.  **Second Excited State:** This is the state with the next lowest energy. We consider the possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`: The configuration is one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`. Total Energy = `1*E_1 + 2*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`: The configuration is two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`. Total Energy = `2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   The lower of these two energies is `18E`.\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground, first excited, and second excited states are `10E`, `15E`, and `18E`, respectively. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
