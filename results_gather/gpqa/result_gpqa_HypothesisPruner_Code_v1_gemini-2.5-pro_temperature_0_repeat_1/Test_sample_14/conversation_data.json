  "question": "Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:\n\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

The ratio of probabilities for Planet 1 and Planet 2 is P1/P2 = (R_star1 / a1) / (R_star2 / a2). Since the stellar radii are equal (R_star1 = R_star2), this simplifies to P1/P2 = a2/a1.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, a³ ∝ T² * M_star, where T is the orbital period and M_star is the stellar mass. This means a ∝ (T² * M_star)^(1/3). We can use this to find the ratio a2/a1.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n*   T1 = T2 / 3 (Period of Planet 1 is 1/3 that of Planet 2)\n*   M_star1 = 2 * M_star2 (Mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2)\n\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes is:\na2/a1 = [ (T2² * M_star2) / (T1² * M_star1) ]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = [ ( (3*T1)² * M_star2 ) / ( T1² * (2*M_star2) ) ]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = [ (9 * T1² * M_star2) / (2 * T1² * M_star2) ]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65\n\nSince P1/P2 = a2/a1, the transit probability of Planet 1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet 2. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The script successfully determined the correct answer by calculating the ratio of transit probabilities for the two planets.\n\nThe transit probability (P) is proportional to the stellar radius (R_star) divided by the planet's semi-major axis (a). Since the stellar radii are equal, the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 simplifies to a2/a1.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is proportional to the cube root of the orbital period squared times the stellar mass ( (T² * M_star)^(1/3) ).\n\nGiven the constraints:\n*   Period of Planet 2 is three times that of Planet 1 (T2 = 3 * T1).\n*   Mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2 (M_star1 = 2 * M_star2).\n\nThe script calculated the ratio of the semi-major axes:\nP1/P2 = a2/a1 = [ (T2² * M_star2) / (T1² * M_star1) ]^(1/3)\nP1/P2 = [ ( (3*T1)² * M_star2 ) / ( T1² * (2*M_star2) ) ]^(1/3)\nP1/P2 = [ (9 * T1² * M_star2) / (2 * T1² * M_star2) ]^(1/3)\nP1/P2 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.651\n\nThe calculation shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This matches the surviving candidate from the code output.\n\n<<<D>>>"
