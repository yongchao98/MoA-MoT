    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the complete script.\n\nHere is a brief plan for solving the problem:\n*   **Hypotheses:** The candidate hypotheses are the four multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) for the photon's momentum.\n*   **Physical Model:** The system is a diatomic molecule described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a state is given by E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]\\*J(J+1).\n*   **Constraints (Transition):** The molecule starts in the fundamental (ground) state (v=0, J=0). An absorbed photon must obey the selection rules Δv=+1 and ΔJ=±1. The lowest energy transition is therefore to the state (v=1, J=1).\n*   **Calculation & Pruning:** We will calculate the energy difference (ΔE) for this transition, then find the corresponding photon momentum (p = ΔE/c). This calculated momentum will be used to prune the hypotheses and find the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_diatomic_momentum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the momentum of a photon absorbed by a diatomic molecule\n    by enumerating hypotheses and pruning with physical constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.

The total energy change ΔE is approximately 4.227e-20 J. The momentum of a photon with this energy is p = ΔE/c, which is calculated to be 1.410e-28 N\\*s. This value is extremely close to option B (1.4e-28 N\\*s).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by first establishing the four multiple-choice options as initial hypotheses. It then applied the physical constraints of the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule.\n\nThe key steps in the calculation were:\n1.  **Identifying the Transition:** The molecule starts in the fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to vibrational quantum number v=0 and rotational quantum number J=0. For a photon to be absorbed, the selection rules are Δv=+1 and ΔJ=±1. The transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy is therefore to the state v=1, J=1.\n2.  **Calculating Transition Energy (ΔE):** The energy of a rovibrational state is E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ²/(2I)]\\*J(J+1). The energy difference for the transition from (0,0) to (1,1) is ΔE = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = ħω + ħ²/I.\n3.  **Calculating Photon Momentum (p):** The script calculated the molecule's reduced mass (μ) and moment of inertia (I) from the given values. It then computed the total energy change ΔE = 4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J. The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by p = ΔE/c.\n4.  **Pruning Hypotheses:** The calculated momentum was p = 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N\\*s. This value was compared against the initial hypotheses, and option B (1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N\\*s) was identified as the best match.\n\nThe code correctly pruned the hypotheses, leaving B as the only viable option.\n\n<<<B>>>"
