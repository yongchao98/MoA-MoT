    "This plan outlines the process of solving the solar neutrino problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses based on the physics of the Sun's core.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The primary hypothesis is that the neutrino flux in any given energy band is the sum of contributions from all relevant nuclear reactions in the Sun (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III, CNO cycle). We will model these sources with their known energy spectra (line or continuous) and approximate flux values.\n*   **Constraint Application:** The core constraint is the sudden cessation of the pp-III branch. This directly translates to setting the flux from the Boron-8 (`8B`) decay, the defining reaction of the pp-III branch, to zero. All other reaction fluxes (`pp`, `7Be`, `CNO`) remain unchanged.\n*   **Candidate Evaluation:** We will calculate the neutrino flux for the two specified energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) *after* applying the constraint. The flux in the first band, previously sourced by `8B`, will drop dramatically, while the flux in the second band, dominated by the unaffected `7Be` line, will remain high.\n*   **Final Selection:** The ratio of the new flux in band 1 to the new flux in band 2 will be calculated. This resulting very small number will be compared against the provided multiple-choice options to find the closest approximate answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_neutrino_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the solar neutrino flux ratio problem by modeling sources,\n    applying constraints, and calculating the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Build Candidate Hypotheses (Neutrino Sources) ---\")\n    # We model the main neutrino sources.

    "The Python script successfully modeled the solar neutrino flux problem. Here is a summary of its execution and reasoning:\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Identification:** The script correctly identified the primary neutrino sources relevant to the energy bands in question: the Boron-8 (`8B`) decay from the pp-III branch, the Beryllium-7 (`7Be`) decay from the pp-II branch, and a smaller background from the CNO cycle.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application:** The core constraint of the problem—the cessation of the pp-III branch—was applied by removing the `8B` neutrino source from the calculations. This is the crucial step, as `8B` decay is the main contributor to the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV energy band.\n\n3.  **Candidate Evaluation:**\n    *   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** After removing the `8B` source, the flux in this band dropped dramatically, leaving only a very small contribution from the CNO cycle. The script calculated this residual flux to be approximately 1.00e+4 units.\n    *   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** This band is dominated by the strong, discrete energy line from `7Be` decay at 861 keV. Since `7Be` is part of the pp-II branch, it was unaffected by the constraint. The script calculated this flux to be approximately 4.50e+9 units.\n\n4.  **Final Selection:** The script calculated the ratio of the new fluxes: (Flux in Band 1) / (Flux in Band 2) ≈ 1.00e+4 / 4.50e+9 ≈ 0.000002. This result is a very small number, close to zero. Comparing this to the available options, 0.01 (10^-2) is the smallest value and the only one that approximates such a drastic reduction.\n\nThe logic is sound: eliminating the primary source for Band 1 while leaving the primary source for Band 2 intact causes their flux ratio to plummet to a value near zero. Option D is the best representation of this outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
