To identify the transition, we must correct for the cosmological redshift caused by the expansion of the universe.\n\n1.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** Using the given distance of 2.1 Gpc (2100 Mpc) and a standard Hubble constant value (H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc), the galaxy's recession velocity is calculated via Hubble's Law (v = H₀d). This velocity is then used to find the redshift (z = v/c), which is approximately 0.49.\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy:** The observed energy (E_obs = 3.9 µeV) is lower than the energy at the source (E_source) due to redshift. The rest-frame energy is found using the formula E_source = E_obs \\* (1 + z), yielding a value of approximately 5.81 µeV (5.81 x 10⁻⁶ eV).\n3.  **Identify the Transition:** This calculated energy is an extremely close match to the well-known energy of the 21-cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (HI), which is ~5.87 µeV.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The 21-cm line is the characteristic signature of the cold atomic interstellar medium. Therefore, the observation is of this medium in the distant galaxy, and the same transition is observed from the cold atomic ISM in our own Milky Way.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the nature of the observed astronomical feature by correcting for cosmological redshift.\n\nFirst, it established four hypotheses corresponding to the multiple-choice options. It then calculated the redshift (z) for an object at a distance of 2.1 Gpc to be approximately 0.49. Using this redshift, it corrected the observed absorption line energy of 3.9 µeV to its rest-frame energy at the source, which was calculated to be ~5.81 µeV.\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy was then compared against the characteristic features of the hypotheses. The value of 5.81 µeV is an extremely close match (within ~1%) to the energy of the 21-cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (HI), which is 5.87 µeV. This transition is the defining signature of the cold atomic interstellar medium. The other hypotheses involving molecular gas or warm (ionized) atomic gas do not feature this transition, and were therefore pruned. The script concluded that the observation was of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
