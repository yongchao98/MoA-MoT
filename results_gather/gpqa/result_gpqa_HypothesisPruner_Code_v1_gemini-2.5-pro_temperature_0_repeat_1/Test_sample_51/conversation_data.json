    "Answering this question requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The core of the problem is the change in the ratio of atomic energy level populations due to a change in temperature. The primary hypothesis is that this change is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The candidate answers (A, B, C, D) are the specific numerical hypotheses for the factor of this change.\n*   **Constraint Application:** The main constraint is the physics of thermal equilibrium. The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy state (n₂) to a lower energy state (n₁) is proportional to `exp(-ΔE / kT)`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature. The problem provides two effective temperatures: one for the star without spots (T₁ = 6000 K) and one for the star with spots (T₂ = 5500 K). The energy difference `ΔE` can be calculated from the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å) using the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n*   **Pruning:** We will calculate the theoretical factor, `Ratio(T₁) / Ratio(T₂)`. This simplifies to `exp(-ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂))`. By plugging in the values for T₁, T₂, and the calculated `ΔE`, we can compute a numerical value for this factor.\n*   **Selection:** The calculated value will be compared against the provided options (A, B, C, D). The option that most closely matches our calculated result will be selected as the final answer. The information about spot coverage (40%) and stellar mass/radius is contextual, justifying the temperature drop, but is not needed for the primary calculation if we use the given effective temperatures.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_stellar_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the stellar photosphere problem by enumerating and testing hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.

This is derived from the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The energy of the transition is first calculated from the given wavelength (1448 Å). Then, the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at the two different temperatures gives the final answer. This result aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully calculated the factor by which the ratio of atomic energy level populations changes. The problem is governed by the Boltzmann equation, which describes how the population of energy states changes with temperature.\n\nThe script first calculated the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels using the provided transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). It then computed the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two given temperatures: T₁ = 6000 K (no spots) and T₂ = 5500 K (with spots). The factor is given by `exp(-ΔE/k * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂))`.\n\nThe calculated result was approximately 4.51. When compared with the provided multiple-choice options, this value is extremely close to option D (4.5). Therefore, the script pruned the other hypotheses and selected D as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
