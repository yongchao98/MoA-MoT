Based on the formulas for equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law, the period ($P$) is proportional to the inverse cube of the temperature ($T_{eq}$), i.e., $P \\propto 1/T_{eq}^3$.\n\nUsing the given temperature ratios, $T_1/T_2 = 1.4$ and $T_2/T_3 = 2.3$, the script calculates the overall temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 as $T_1/T_3 = (T_1/T_2) \\times (T_2/T_3) = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$.\n\nFinally, it calculates the period ratio $P_3/P_1$ using the derived relationship: $P_3/P_1 = (T_1/T_3)^3 = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.38$. This calculated value is compared against the provided options, and the closest match is identified as option C, which has a value of 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The script successfully determined the relationship between orbital period and equilibrium temperature and used it to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by listing the four possible answers (A: 3.2, B: 4.4, C: 33.4, D: 10.4) as the initial set of hypotheses.\n2.  **Constraint Application:** The core constraint was derived from physics: the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the inverse cube of the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$), or $P \\propto T_{eq}^{-3}$. This means the ratio $P_3/P_1$ is equal to $(T_1/T_3)^3$. The script then calculated $T_1/T_3$ by multiplying the given ratios: $T_1/T_3 = (T_1/T_2) \\times (T_2/T_3) = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$. Using this, it calculated the expected period ratio: $P_3/P_1 = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.39$.\n3.  **Selection:** The calculated value of ~33.4 was compared to the initial hypotheses. Option C (33.4) was an almost perfect match, leading to its selection as the final answer. The information about planet masses and albedo was correctly identified as extraneous to the calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
