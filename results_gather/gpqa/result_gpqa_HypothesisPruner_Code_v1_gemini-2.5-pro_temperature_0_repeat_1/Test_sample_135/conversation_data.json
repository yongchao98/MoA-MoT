    "My plan is as follows:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The candidate hypotheses are the provided multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n*   **Constraint Application:** The primary constraint is the Divergence Theorem, which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of that field through the enclosing surface. I will calculate this surface integral (flux).\n*   **Calculation:** The field is `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`. The surface is a sphere of radius R, where the surface element `dS` is also in the radial direction. The surface integral simplifies to `(1/R^2)` times the surface area of the sphere (`4 * pi * R^2`).\n*   **Pruning and Selection:** The calculated result will be compared against the initial hypotheses. The hypothesis that matches the result will be selected as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define hypotheses based on the multiple-choice options.\n# 2.

It then applies the Divergence Theorem as a constraint. This theorem equates the desired volume integral to the flux of the field through the enclosing surface (a sphere of radius R).\n\nThe calculation of the flux `∮(f ⋅ dS)` is performed:\n1.  The dot product `f ⋅ dS` simplifies to `(1/r^2) dS`.\n2.  On the surface of the sphere, `r` is constant and equal to `R`, so the integrand is `1/R^2`.\n3.  The integral becomes `(1/R^2)` multiplied by the total surface area of the sphere (`4 * pi * R^2`).\n4.  The result of the calculation is `(1/R^2) * (4 * pi * R^2) = 4 * pi`.\n\nThis calculated result of `4 * pi` is used to prune the initial hypotheses. Hypothesis B (`4 * pi`) is the only one that matches. Therefore, it is selected as the final answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to summarize the code output and provide the final answer.\n\nThe Python script evaluated the volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field by applying the Divergence Theorem. This theorem converts the volume integral into a surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume (a sphere of radius R).\n\nThe script performed the following steps:\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The multiple-choice options A, B, C, and D were established as the initial hypotheses.\n2.  **Constraint Application:** The Divergence Theorem was used to calculate the integral. The surface integral (flux) of the field `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` through a sphere of radius R was calculated.\n3.  **Calculation:** The flux was found to be `(1/R^2)` multiplied by the surface area of the sphere (`4 * pi * R^2`), resulting in `4 * pi`.\n4.  **Pruning and Selection:** The calculated value `4 * pi` was compared against the hypotheses. Only hypothesis B matched the result.\n\nThe code output confirms that the calculated value of the integral is `4*pi`, and the only surviving candidate is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
