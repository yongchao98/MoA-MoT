The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$. Plugging this into the formula gives the energy: $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for the n-th energy level is given by the formula $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$. For the third excited state ($n=3$), the degeneracy is $g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by systematically applying the physical principles of the 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by creating four hypotheses corresponding to the multiple-choice options A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Energy Constraint:** It first calculated the energy of the third excited state. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$. The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$, so the energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$. This calculation eliminated options A and D, which have a different energy formula.\n3.  **Degeneracy Constraint:** Next, the script calculated the degeneracy (the number of possible eigenfunctions) for this energy level. The degeneracy is given by $g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$. For $n=3$, the degeneracy is $g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = 10$. This eliminated option B, which had the correct energy but the wrong degeneracy (3).\n4.  **Final Choice:** Only option C survived both constraints, having both the correct energy of $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the correct degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
