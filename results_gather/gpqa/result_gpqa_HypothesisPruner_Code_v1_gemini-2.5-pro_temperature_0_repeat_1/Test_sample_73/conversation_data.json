    "My plan is to:\n*   Model the radioactive decay using the exponential decay formula, P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n*   Use the given information (32% decay probability in 100 minutes) to calculate the decay constant, λ.\n*   Leverage the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay, which means the 50 minutes that have already passed do not affect the future probability.\n*   Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes using the calculated λ and select the closest answer from the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the candidate hypotheses from the multiple-choice options.\nhypotheses = {\n    \"A\": 0.52,\n    \"B\": 0.44,\n    \"C\": 0.48,\n    \"D\": 0.40,\n}\nprint(f\"Initial hypotheses: {hypotheses}\")\n\n# Step 2: Apply constraints to prune hypotheses.\n# Constraint 1: The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.\n# P(decay in t) = 1 - exp(-lambda * t)\n# 0.32 = 1 - exp(-lambda * 100)\n# exp(-lambda * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# -lambda * 100 = ln(0.68)\n# lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100\nprob_100_min = 0.32\ntime_100_min = 100\ndecay_constant = -math.log(1 - prob_100_min) / time_100_min\nprint(f\"Calculated decay constant (lambda): {decay_constant}\")\n\n# Constraint 2: 50 minutes have passed without decay.\n# Radioactive decay is a memoryless process.

Radioactive decay is a memoryless process, meaning the 50 minutes that have passed without decay do not influence the future probability. The clock effectively resets. Using the calculated decay constant, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is computed. The result is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to option B, 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by following the planned steps.\n\n1.  **Calculate Decay Constant (λ):** Using the given probability of 32% decay in 100 minutes, the script calculated the decay constant λ to be approximately 0.003857 per minute.\n2.  **Apply Memoryless Property:** The script correctly identified that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. The calculation for the next 150 minutes is independent of the past 50 minutes.\n3.  **Calculate Future Probability:** The script then calculated the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes using the formula `P(decay) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`.\n4.  **Select Best Hypothesis:** The calculated probability was 0.4393 (or 43.93%). Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest value is 44% (Option B). The script correctly identified 'B' as the final choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
