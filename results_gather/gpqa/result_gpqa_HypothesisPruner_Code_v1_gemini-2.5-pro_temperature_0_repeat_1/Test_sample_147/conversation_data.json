    "An brief plan to solve the problem is as follows:\n*   Identify potential candidates for element Y by using the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2 (ɷF=31.96%). The formula M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n (where n is the number of fluorine atoms in A2) will be used to find elements whose molar mass is an integer multiple of ~40.45.\n*   For each promising candidate element Y, verify the other constraints given in the problem. This includes the existence of at least five binary fluorides (as a premise), the decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine, and the properties of the compounds (color, reactivity with xenon).\n*   The most critical constraint to apply is the 1:1 molar reaction of element Y with compound A4 to produce A5. This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, which will help identify the formulas of A4 and A5.\n*   After identifying the most plausible element Y and the formula for compound A4, calculate its molecular weight and determine which of the given ranges it falls into.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry puzzle by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses for element Y based on mass fraction of F in A2.\")\n    \n    # Constraint: A2 has ɷF = 31.96%\n    # ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    # 0.3196 = (n * 19) / (M_Y + n * 19)\n    # M_Y = (19n / 0.3196) - 19n = 59.45n - 19n = 40.45n\n    # We will look for elements where M_Y / n is approx. 40.45\n\n    # Let's define potential candidates and their properties\n    # Format: 'Symbol': {'mass': Molar Mass, 'fluorides': [list of F counts in known binary fluorides]}\n    candidates = {\n        'Sb': {'mass': 121.8, 'fluorides': [3, 5]},\n        'Kr': {'mass': 83.8, 'fluorides': [2, 4]},\n        'Pu': {'mass': 244.0, 'fluorides': [3, 4, 6]},\n        'Au': {'mass': 197.0, 'fluorides': [3, 5, 6, 7]}, # Including unstable ones\n    }\n    F_MASS = 18.998\n    TARGET_WF = 0.3196\n    \n    potential_solutions = []\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply constraints to filter candidates.\")\n    for symbol, properties in candidates.items():\n        print(f\"\\n--- Evaluating Candidate Y = {symbol} ---\")\n        is_viable = False\n        \n        # Constraint: Find A2 based on mass fraction\n        for n in properties['fluorides']:\n            formula = f\"{symbol}F{n}\"\n            molar_mass = properties['mass'] + n * F_MASS\n            wF = (n * F_MASS) / molar_mass\n            \n            # Check if mass fraction is a close match (within 2.5% relative error)\n            if abs(wF - TARGET_WF) / TARGET_WF < 0.025:\n                print(f\"Found a potential match for A2: {formula}\")\n                print(f\"Calculated ɷF = {wF:.4f} (Target: {TARGET_WF})\")\n                \n                # We have a hypothesis: Y=symbol, A2=YF_n\n                # Now check other constraints\n                \n                # Constraint: A1 decomposes to A2 + F2.

    "The Python script successfully identified the unknown element Y and its compounds by systematically applying the constraints from the problem description.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script first used the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2 (31.96%) to calculate a relationship between the molar mass of element Y and the number of fluorine atoms in A2 (`M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n`). This led to the consideration of elements like Krypton (Kr), Antimony (Sb), and Plutonium (Pu) as potential candidates for Y.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application & Pruning:**\n    *   The script evaluated Krypton (Y=Kr). If A2 is KrF2, its fluorine mass percentage is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given value.\n    *   The decomposition `A1 -> A2 + F2` corresponds to the known reaction `KrF4 -> KrF2 + F2`. This identifies A1 as KrF4.\n    *   The 1:1 molar reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` strongly suggests the comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF4 -> 2 KrF2`. This identifies A4 as KrF4 and A5 as KrF2.\n    *   Other candidates like Sb and Pu were eliminated because their fluoride chemistry did not match the reaction constraints (e.g., SbF5 is too stable, PuF8 is unknown).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only viable candidate was Krypton. The compound A4 was identified as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4). The molecular weight of KrF4 is calculated as 83.80 (for Kr) + 4 * 18.998 (for F) = 159.79 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the 140-160 range.\n\n<<<D>>>"
