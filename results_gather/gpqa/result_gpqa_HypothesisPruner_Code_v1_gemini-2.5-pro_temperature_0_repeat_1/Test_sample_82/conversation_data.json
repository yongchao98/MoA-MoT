It then calculated the two required pH values based on chemical principles to act as constraints.\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration:** The script calculated the pKa of acetic acid and used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system where the ratio of conjugate base to acid is 1:3. The resulting pH was calculated to be **4.26**.\n2.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** The script calculated the concentration of the acetate conjugate base at the equivalence point and then determined the pH resulting from its hydrolysis in water. The resulting pH was calculated to be **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pair of pH values (4.26, 8.52) was used to filter the initial hypotheses. Hypothesis **B** (4.26, 8.52) was a perfect match for the calculated constraints and was identified as the sole surviving candidate.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the titration problem by first calculating the theoretical pH values and then using them as constraints to prune the initial hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Calculation at 25% Titration:** The script used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])). At 25% neutralization, the ratio of conjugate base [A-] to acid [HA] is 0.25/0.75, or 1/3. The calculated pH was **4.26**.\n2.  **Calculation at Equivalence Point:** The script calculated the concentration of the acetate conjugate base formed at the equivalence point. It then determined the pH resulting from the hydrolysis of this base in water, which yielded a pH of **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pair of values (4.26, 8.52) perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
