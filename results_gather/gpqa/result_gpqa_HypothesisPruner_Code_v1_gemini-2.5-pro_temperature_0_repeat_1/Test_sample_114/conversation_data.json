    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the complete script.\n\nHere is a brief plan for solving the problem:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The initial hypotheses are the four multiple-choice answers provided: 96, 172, 138, and 74 degrees.\n*   **Constraint Formulation:** The solution is constrained by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from the theory of special relativity.\n*   **Calculation & Filtering:** Using the given Lorentz factors for the electron and positron, I will calculate the total initial energy and momentum of the system. By applying the conservation laws to the final state (two photons of equal energy), I can derive the angle `theta` each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The angle between the photons will be `2 * theta`.\n*   **Selection:** The calculated angle will be compared against the initial hypotheses, and the closest match will be selected as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the electron-positron annihilation problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.

    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by applying the principles of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The script began by listing the four possible answers for the angle between the photons: 96, 172, 138, and 74 degrees.\n2.  **Constraints and Calculation:** Using the given Lorentz factors for the electron (γ=4) and positron (γ=2), the script calculated the total initial energy and momentum of the system before the collision. By enforcing the laws of conservation of energy and momentum, it determined the properties of the two resulting photons. Since the photons have equal energy, they must be emitted at symmetric angles (+θ and -θ) relative to the initial axis of motion. The calculation yielded a value of approximately 138.19 degrees for the total angle between the two photons (2θ).\n3.  **Filtering and Selection:** The calculated angle of 138.19 degrees was compared against the initial hypotheses. Option C (138 degrees) was found to be an excellent match, falling well within the defined tolerance. The script correctly identified C as the final choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
