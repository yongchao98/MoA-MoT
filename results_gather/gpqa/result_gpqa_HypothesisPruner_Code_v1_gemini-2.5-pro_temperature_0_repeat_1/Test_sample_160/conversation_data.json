    "Here is a brief plan to solve the problem:\n*   **Hypothesize:** Formulate the four options (A, B, C, D) as competing hypotheses about the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n*   **Analyze Constraints:** Apply the physical principles of mean free path (MFP). The core constraint is that MFP (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), i.e., λ ∝ 1/σ.\n*   **Compare Cross-Sections:** Compare the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (σ1) with the cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ2). A simple hard-sphere model will be used for this comparison.\n*   **Prune and Select:** Use the relationship between σ1 and σ2 to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2, filtering out hypotheses that contradict this physical reasoning and selecting the one that is consistent.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_microscope_mfp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates and prunes hypotheses to determine the relationship between\n    the mean free path of gas-gas collisions (λ1) and electron-gas collisions (λ2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses from the problem's options.\n    hypotheses = [\n        {\"option\": \"A\", \"relation\": \"λ2 = λ1\", \"description\": \"The mean free path is unchanged.\"},\n        {\"option\": \"B\", \"relation\": \"λ2 < λ1\", \"description\": \"The electron's mean free path is shorter.\"},\n        {\"option\": \"C\", \"relation\": \"λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\", \"description\": \"The electron's mean free path is slightly longer.\"},\n        {\"option\": \"D\", \"relation\": \"λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\", \"description\": \"The electron's mean free path is significantly longer.\"},\n    ]\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Candidate Hypotheses ---\")\n    for h in hypotheses:\n        print(f\"Hypothesis {h['option']}: {h['relation']} ({h['description']})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply constraints from physics to filter hypotheses.\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Applying Physical Constraints ---\")\n    print(\"Constraint 1: The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ).\")\n    print(\"λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' (gas density) is constant.

It then applies the physical principle that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ). By comparing a simplified model for the gas-gas collision cross-section (σ1) with the electron-gas collision cross-section (σ2), it concludes that σ1 is significantly larger than σ2 (approximately by a factor of 4). This implies that λ2 must be significantly larger than λ1. The script then filters the initial hypotheses, finding that only option D, which states `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`, is consistent with this physical conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The script executed a logical analysis based on the physics of mean free path (MFP). Here is a summary of the process:\n\n1.  **Hypotheses Enumeration:** The four multiple-choice options were set up as distinct hypotheses.\n2.  **Constraint Application:** The core physical principle applied is that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ). The number density of gas molecules (*n*) is the same for both scenarios.\n    *   λ1 (gas-gas MFP) ∝ 1/σ1\n    *   λ2 (electron-gas MFP) ∝ 1/σ2\n3.  **Cross-Section Comparison:** The script compared the two cross-sections using a simplified hard-sphere model.\n    *   The cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule (σ1) is determined by the sum of their radii, leading to σ1 ≈ 4πr².\n    *   The cross-section for a point-like electron colliding with a gas molecule (σ2) is determined primarily by the molecule's radius, leading to σ2 ≈ πr².\n4.  **Pruning and Selection:** The analysis concluded that σ1 is approximately four times larger than σ2. Consequently, λ2 should be approximately four times larger than λ1. This result was used to test the initial hypotheses, and only option D (`λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`) was found to be consistent with this physical conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"
