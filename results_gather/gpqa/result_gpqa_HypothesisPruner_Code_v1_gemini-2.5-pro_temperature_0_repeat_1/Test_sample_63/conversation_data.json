    "The Python script successfully solved the chemical puzzle by systematically analyzing the experimental data and testing a plausible hypothesis.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n1.  **Product Identification:** The script first calculated the molar amounts of the gaseous products from the given mass and volume changes.\n    *   Mass increase in tube №1 (H₂O absorber) of 3.60 g corresponds to **0.20 mol of H₂O**.\n    *   Mass increase in tube №3 (O₂ absorber) of 0.80 g corresponds to **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas C (inert) corresponds to **0.10 mol of N₂**.\n    *   The fact that the weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change confirms the absence of acidic gases like CO₂.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Formulation:** The products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) strongly suggest the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts. The script hypothesized the salts to be Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃), which decompose as follows:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\n3.  **Constraint Application & Verification:** The script tested this hypothesis against the problem's constraints.\n    *   Since only Ammonium Nitrate produces O₂, the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from the decomposition of **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**.\n    *   Because the mixture is equimolar, there must also be **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**.\n    *   This hypothesis correctly predicts the amounts of the other products:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.05 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.10 mol** (Matches experiment).\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.05*2 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.05*2 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.20 mol** (Matches experiment).\n    *   Finally, the total mass is verified: 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol (NH₄NO₂) + 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol (NH₄NO₃) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g** (Matches experiment).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The total number of atoms is calculated by summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
