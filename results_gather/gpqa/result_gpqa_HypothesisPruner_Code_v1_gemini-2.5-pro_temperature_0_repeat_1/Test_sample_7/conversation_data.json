    "Here is a plan for solving the problem:\n*   **Represent Hypotheses:** The four multiple-choice options will be encoded as a list of Python dictionaries, making them easy to process. Each dictionary will represent a hypothesis with keys for the proposed transcription factor (TF), the interaction between G1 and G3, and the epistasis relationship.\n*   **Define and Model Constraints:** The experimental results will be translated into logical constraints. Key genetic concepts like epistasis (one gene's mutation masking another's) and synergy (a double mutant having a much stronger phenotype than the sum of single mutants) will be modeled as functions that test these conditions against the data.\n*   **Evaluate and Prune Hypotheses:** Each hypothesis will be systematically evaluated against the constraints. A scoring system will be used to quantify how well each hypothesis aligns with the experimental data. We will prioritize the most definitive conclusions, such as the identity of the main regulatory gene (the likely TF) and clear-cut epistasis.\n*   **Select Best Fit:** The script will print the evaluation of each hypothesis, showing which constraints it passes or fails. The hypothesis with the highest score, representing the best explanation for the data despite potential inconsistencies in the options, will be selected as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_genetics_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates and prunes hypotheses based on genetic experimental data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan Step 1: Represent Hypotheses\n    # Each hypothesis from the multiple-choice options is a dictionary.\n    hypotheses = [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"A\",\n            \"TF\": \"G1\",\n            \"G1_G3_interaction\": \"pleiotropy\",\n            \"epistasis\": \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"B\",\n            \"TF\": \"G2\",\n            \"G1_G3_interaction\": \"same promoter\",\n            \"epistasis\": \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"C\",\n            \"TF\": \"G2\",\n            \"G1_G3_interaction\": \"gene redundancy\",\n            \"epistasis\": \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"D\",\n            \"TF\": \"G2\",\n            \"G1_G3_interaction\": \"pleiotropy\",\n            \"epistasis\": \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"--- Initial Candidate Hypotheses ---\")\n    for h in hypotheses:\n        print(f\"Hypothesis {h['id']}: {h}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Plan Step 2: Define and Model Constraints from the data\n    data = {\n        \"g1\": 75, \"g2\": 0, \"g3\": 50,\n        \"g1g2\": 0, \"g1g3\": 10, \"g2g3\": 0,\n        \"wt\": 100\n    }\n\n    # Constraint 1: Identify the Transcription Factor (TF)\n    # The TF is an upstream regulator.

However, we must choose the best conclusion among the given choices.\n\n1.  **Transcription Factor Identity:** The `g2` mutant shows a 0% resistance phenotype, which is the most severe effect and completely masks the phenotypes of `g1` and `g3` in double mutants (`g1g2` and `g2g3` are both 0%). This makes G2 the clear candidate for an essential upstream regulator, as stated in the problem. This evidence strongly supports hypotheses B, C, and D over A.\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 Interaction:** The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance (25% loss) and the `g3` mutant has 50% resistance (50% loss). An additive effect would result in a 75% loss (25% resistance). The double mutant `g1g3` has only 10% resistance (a 90% loss), which is greater than the sum of the individual losses. This synergistic effect suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance. Among the options, \"gene redundancy\" (Option C) is the best functional description for this type of synergistic interaction.\n\n3.  **Epistasis:** The data shows that `g2` is epistatic to `g1` and `g3`. However, options B, C, and D all make incorrect claims about epistasis between G1 and G3 (e.g., \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"). Since this clause is incorrect in all three of the most plausible options, we select the option that is correct on the other two, more significant, points.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hypothesis C correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and provides the most accurate functional description (\"gene redundancy\") for the synergistic interaction between G1 and G3. Although its statement on epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, so are the equivalent statements in the other viable options. Therefore, C is the best overall conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python script analyzed four hypotheses against the experimental data. Here is a summary of its findings:\n\n1.  **Transcription Factor Identification:** The script correctly identified G2 as the most likely transcription factor. The `g2` single mutant has a 0% resistance phenotype, the most severe outcome. Furthermore, in the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants, the phenotype is also 0%, meaning the `g2` mutation is epistatic (masks the effects of) `g1` and `g3`. This strongly suggests G2 is an essential upstream regulator. This finding eliminated Hypothesis A.\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 Interaction:** The script evaluated the interaction between G1 and G3. The single mutants `g1` and `g3` cause a partial loss of resistance (to 75% and 50%, respectively). The double mutant `g1g3` has a much more severe phenotype (10% resistance) than a simple additive effect would predict. This synergistic interaction is best described as \"gene redundancy,\" where G1 and G3 likely have overlapping or parallel functions contributing to resistance. The script correctly identified this, giving Hypothesis C a higher score for providing the most accurate description.\n\n3.  **Epistasis Claims:** The script noted that the specific epistasis claims regarding G1 and G3 in hypotheses B, C, and D are not supported by the data. For example, in Hypothesis C, the claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is false because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n**Conclusion:** Although no single option was a perfect match, the script selected Hypothesis C as the best fit. It correctly identifies the most important gene (G2 as the TF) and provides the best explanation for the relationship between the other two genes (G1 and G3 show gene redundancy).\n\n<<<C>>>"
