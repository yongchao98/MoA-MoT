  "question": "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR.

    "This plan outlines the process of identifying the unknown compound by systematically evaluating each candidate against the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Hypotheses Generation**: Define the four candidate molecules provided in the question as our initial set of hypotheses.\n*   **Constraint Definition**: Translate the information from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra into specific, testable constraints. The key constraints are the presence of protons that would give rise to a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) splitting pattern.\n*   **Filtering and Pruning**: For each candidate molecule, analyze its structure to determine if it contains protons that match the environments required for both the dtq (6 neighbors: 1H, 2H, 3H) and dtt (5 neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H) signals. Discard any hypothesis that does not satisfy both constraints.\n*   **Conclusion**: Identify the single remaining candidate as the correct structure and present it as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    # Plan Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses\n    # The four candidate molecules are represented as a dictionary.\n    # We include a simplified structural analysis focusing on the neighbors of key protons.\n    # A proton giving a 'dtq' must be coupled to three distinct groups of protons: 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n    # A proton giving a 'dtt' must be coupled to three distinct groups of protons: 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n    candidates = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"protons_with_5_neighbors\": 1, # CH(c) neighbors: CH2(b), CH(d), CH2(ethyl) -> 2H, 1H, 2H\n                \"protons_with_6_neighbors\": 0\n            }\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"protons_with_5_neighbors\": 1, # CH(c) neighbors: CH(b), CH2(ethyl), CH2(acid) -> 1H, 2H, 2H\n                \"protons_with_6_neighbors\": 1  # CH(b) neighbors: CH3(a), CH(c), CH2(ethyl) -> 3H, 1H, 2H\n            }\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"name\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"protons_with_5_neighbors\": 0,\n                \"protons_with_6_neighbors\": 1 # CH(c) neighbors: CH2(b), CH(d), CH3(methyl) -> 2H, 1H, 3H\n            }\n        },\n        \"D\": {\n            \"name\": \"CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\",\n            \"analysis\": {\n                \"protons_with_5_neighbors\": 0,\n                \"protons_with_6_neighbors\": 1 # CH(d) neighbors: CH(b), CH3(methyl), CH2(acid) -> 1H, 3H, 2H\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Initial Hypotheses ---\")\n    for key, value in candidates.items():\n        print(f\"Candidate {key}: {value['name']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 28)\n\n    # Plan Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n    print(\"\\n--- Applying Constraints ---\")\n    # Constraint 1: FTIR shows a carboxylic acid (COOH).\n    # All candidates have a COOH group, so this is consistent with all hypotheses.\n    print(\"Constraint 1 (FTIR): Presence of COOH group.

Candidate A was therefore eliminated.\n3.  **Conclusion**: After applying all constraints, only candidate B remained.

    "The Python script successfully identified the unknown compound by systematically applying constraints derived from the provided spectral data.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses**: The four candidate molecules (A, B, C, D) were defined.\n2.  **Filtering**:\n    *   The FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) and the absence of vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR were consistent with all four candidates, as they all contain a carboxylic acid group and are saturated alkanes.\n    *   The first key ¹H NMR constraint was the presence of a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt). This requires a proton coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (doublet), two protons (triplet), and another two protons (triplet). The script correctly identified that only candidates A and B possess a proton in such an environment, thus eliminating C and D.\n    *   The second key ¹H NMR constraint was the presence of a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq). This requires a proton coupled to one proton (doublet), two protons (triplet), and three protons (quartet). Applying this constraint to the remaining candidates (A and B), the script found that only candidate B has a proton that fits this description. Candidate A was therefore eliminated.\n3.  **Conclusion**: After all constraints were applied, only candidate B, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, remained.
