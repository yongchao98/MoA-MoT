This gravitational compression increases its density. The model estimates a density of ~7.54 g/cm³, which is substantially higher than Earth's.\n*   **Hypothesis d:** A planet with the same composition but half of Earth's mass will be less compressed by gravity. Its density will therefore be lower than Earth's.

    "The script analyzed the four exoplanet scenarios to determine which would have the highest density.\n\n*   **Candidate a:** An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet has Earth's density by definition, which is 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **Candidate b:** This planet's density is explicitly stated as 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **Candidate d:** A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would be less compressed by its own gravity, resulting in a density *lower* than Earth's (calculated as ~4.82 g/cm³).\n*   **Candidate c:** A planet with the same composition as Earth but five times the mass would be significantly more compressed by its own gravity. This gravitational compression increases its density substantially, making it much denser than Earth (calculated as ~7.47 g/cm³).\n\nComparing the results, the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) is the densest of the four options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
