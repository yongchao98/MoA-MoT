    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is described by Bessel functions.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The potential answers for the angular distance between the first two minima are given as multiples of `lambda / a`.\n    *   H1: `0.500 * lambda / a`\n    *   H2: `1.220 * lambda / a`\n    *   H3: `0.506 * lambda / a`\n    *   H4: `0.610 * lambda / a`\n\n*   **Constraint Application:**\n    1.  **Shape:** As N -> infinity, the N-sided polygon with constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius `r = a`. The diameter of this circular aperture is `D = 2r = 2a`.\n    2.  **Diffraction Formula:** For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the diffraction minima are given by `sin(theta) = m * lambda / D`, where `m` are constants derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J1(x)`. The small angle approximation `sin(theta) ≈ theta` is used.\n    3.  **Minima Positions:** The first minimum corresponds to the first zero of `J1(x)`, which gives the constant `m1 ≈ 1.220`. The second minimum corresponds to the second zero, giving `m2 ≈ 2.233`.\n    4.  **Calculation:** The angular position of the first minimum is `theta_1 ≈ 1.220 * lambda / D = 1.220 * lambda / (2a) = 0.610 * lambda / a`. The angular position of the second minimum is `theta_2 ≈ 2.233 * lambda / D = 2.233 * lambda / (2a) = 1.1165 * lambda / a`.\n    5.  **Final Quantity:** The angular distance between these two minima is `delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1`.\n\n*   **Pruning and Selection:** The code will calculate `delta_theta` based on these physical principles and filter the initial hypotheses to find the matching option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_diffraction_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the diffraction problem by enumerating and filtering hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.

The problem, therefore, simplifies to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a' (and diameter D = 2a).\n\nThe angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture are given by the formula:\n`sin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D`\nwhere `λ` is the wavelength, `D` is the diameter, and `m` is a constant derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function (`J1`).\n\n-   For the first minimum, `m1 ≈ 1.220`.\n-   For the second minimum, `m2 ≈ 2.233`.\n\nSubstituting `D = 2a` into the formulas:\n-   The angular position of the first minimum is `θ1 ≈ 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`.\n-   The angular position of the second minimum is `θ2 ≈ 2.233 * λ / (2a) = 1.1165 * λ / a`.\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ2 - θ1`.\n`Δθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a = 0.5065 * λ / a`.\n\nThis calculated value `0.5065 * λ / a` is a very close match to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python script successfully modeled the physics of the problem.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by listing the four possible coefficients for `λ/a` from the multiple-choice options (0.500, 1.220, 0.506, 0.610).\n\n2.  **Constraint Application & Calculation:** The core constraint is that an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. The script then applied the physics of Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture.\n    *   It correctly identified that the diameter of the aperture is `D = 2a`.\n    *   It used the precise zeros of the first-order Bessel function (`z1 ≈ 3.8317` and `z2 ≈ 7.0156`) to determine the angular positions of the first two minima.\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum was calculated as `θ1 ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a`.\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum was calculated as `θ2 ≈ 1.1166 * λ/a`.\n    *   The required quantity, the angular distance between them, was calculated as `Δθ = θ2 - θ1 ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a`.\n\n3.  **Pruning & Selection:** The calculated coefficient `0.5067` was compared to the initial hypotheses. It closely matched the coefficient from option C (0.506). The script correctly pruned the other options and selected C as the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
