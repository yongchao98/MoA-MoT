    "My plan is to solve this problem by:\n*   Representing each multiple-choice option as a distinct hypothesis.\n*   Establishing the physical constraints imposed by the question. The key constraint is the existence of magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles).\n*   Filtering the hypotheses based on which of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for magnetic monopoles. This involves changing both Gauss's law for magnetism and, for symmetry, Faraday's law.\n*   Identifying the single hypothesis that correctly accounts for all necessary changes.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_maxwell_question():\n    # 1.

The script correctly identifies that this law must change, pruning hypothesis B, which does not include this change.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Symmetry):** The existence of magnetic monopoles implies the existence of magnetic currents, which, by symmetry with electric currents, must be a source for the electric field. This modifies Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E). The script correctly identifies that this law must also change, pruning hypotheses C and D because they do not account for this modification.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Hypothesis A is the only one that survives both constraints, as it correctly identifies that both the law for the divergence of the magnetic field and the law for the circulation (curl) of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The script successfully identified the correct answer by systematically applying physical constraints.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by representing each multiple-choice option as a distinct hypothesis.\n2.  **Constraint Application:**\n    *   **Constraint 1:** The existence of magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) means that the magnetic field can have a source or a sink. This directly modifies Gauss's Law for Magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0). The script correctly pruned any hypothesis that did not include a change to this law.\n    *   **Constraint 2:** The introduction of magnetic monopoles creates a new symmetry in the equations. Just as a moving electric charge creates a magnetic field, a moving magnetic monopole (a \"magnetic current\") would create an electric field. This modifies Faraday's Law of Induction, which describes the circulation (or curl) of the electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). The script correctly pruned the remaining hypotheses that did not account for this second necessary change.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Only hypothesis A survived this two-step filtering process. It correctly identified that both the law for the divergence of the magnetic field and the law for the circulation of the electric field would need to be modified.\n\n<<<A>>>"
