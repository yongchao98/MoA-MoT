First, it determines the initial concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ (0.0367 M) and HPO₄²⁻ (0.0281 M). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship for the second dissociation (Ka₂), it calculates the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] to be 8.11x10⁻⁸ M. Finally, it uses this [H⁺] value and the equilibrium for the third dissociation (Ka₃) to find the concentration of PO₄³⁻. The calculated value is 6.235x10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this result to the provided options, it is extremely close to option C (6.24x10⁻⁷ M), which is selected as the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python script successfully calculated the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) by following a logical, step-by-step process based on chemical equilibrium principles.\n\n1.  **Initialization:** The script began by defining the initial conditions (masses, molar masses, volume) and the set of possible answers (hypotheses A, B, C, D).\n2.  **Concentration Calculation:** It calculated the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O), to be 0.0367 M and 0.0281 M, respectively.\n3.  **Equilibrium Analysis:** The script then used the second acid dissociation constant (Ka₂) to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺], which was determined to be 8.11x10⁻⁸ M. Using this [H⁺] and the third dissociation constant (Ka₃), it calculated the final orthophosphate concentration, [PO₄³⁻].\n4.  **Hypothesis Pruning:** The calculated [PO₄³⁻] was 6.236x10⁻⁷ M. This result was compared to the initial hypotheses, and it most closely matched option C (6.24x10⁻⁷ M). Therefore, options A, B, and D were pruned.\n\nThe final choice selected by the script is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
