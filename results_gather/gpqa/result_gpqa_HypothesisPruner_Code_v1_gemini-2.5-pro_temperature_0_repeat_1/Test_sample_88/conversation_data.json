This structure is consistent with the IR spectrum (ketone at 1720 cm⁻¹) and ¹H NMR spectrum (vinylic protons at 4.79 ppm).\n2.  **Product 1** is subjected to a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the double bond, yielding **Product 2: 4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol**.\n3.  **Product 2** undergoes ozonolysis with a reductive workup (O₃, then DMS). This cleaves the exocyclic C=CH₂ double bond, converting it into a ketone. The alcohol group remains, resulting in **Product 3: 2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one**.\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3.\n*   The most deshielded proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the H on C2), which typically appears at δ 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n*   In the preferred chair conformation of the ring, the hydroxyl group is equatorial, placing this proton in an axial position.\n*   This axial proton (H2) is coupled to three neighbors:\n    1.  The axial proton on C3 (large axial-axial coupling, J ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n    2.  The equatorial proton on C3 (small axial-equatorial coupling, J ≈ 2-4 Hz).\n    3.  The bridgehead proton on C1 (small gauche coupling, J ≈ 2-4 Hz).\n*   The signal is split into a large doublet by the axial-axial coupling. Each peak of this doublet is then split into a triplet by the two smaller, nearly equivalent couplings. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the multi-step synthesis problem by systematically identifying each intermediate product and analyzing the final structure.\n\n1.  **Product 1 Identification:** Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the reaction with hot KOH causes a cage-opening rearrangement. The script correctly used the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and the ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (vinylic protons) to identify Product 1 as **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**.\n\n2.  **Product 2 Identification:** The reduction of Product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. The script correctly identified that this reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol, yielding **Product 2: 4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol**.\n\n3.  **Product 3 Identification:** The ozonolysis of Product 2 with a reductive workup (DMS) cleaves the C=C double bond. The script correctly determined that this converts the exocyclic methylene group into a ketone, forming **Product 3: 2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one**.\n\n4.  **NMR Analysis of Product 3:** The script then analyzed the structure of Product 3 to predict the splitting pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H at C2) is the most deshielded.\n    *   **Conformation and Coupling:** In the stable chair conformation, this proton is axial. It is coupled to three adjacent protons: one axial proton on C3 (large J-coupling), one equatorial proton on C3 (small J-coupling), and one bridgehead proton on C1 (small J-coupling).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The large coupling splits the signal into a doublet. The two smaller, similar couplings then split each peak of the doublet into a triplet. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
