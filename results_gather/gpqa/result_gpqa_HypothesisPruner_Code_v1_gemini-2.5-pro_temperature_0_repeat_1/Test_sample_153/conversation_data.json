All four candidates match this.\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** The very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer, and the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid. This eliminates Phenyl chloroformate (C) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D).\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm is the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid. The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), each integrating to two protons, are the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B) but not 2-chlorobenzoic acid (A), which would show a more complex splitting pattern.\n\nTherefore, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure consistent with all the data.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the unknown compound by systematically applying constraints from the provided spectral data.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with four potential structures: 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, Phenyl chloroformate, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.\n2.  **Mass Spectrometry Constraint:** The mass spectrum data (M+ at 156, M+2 at 158) indicated a molecule with a molecular weight of ~156.5 containing one chlorine atom. All four candidates met this criterion, so none were eliminated.\n3.  **IR Spectroscopy Constraint:** The IR data, showing a broad O-H stretch (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) and a C=O stretch (1720 cm⁻¹), is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This constraint eliminated Phenyl chloroformate and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, leaving the two benzoic acid isomers.\n4.  **¹H NMR Constraint:** The NMR data was decisive. The singlet at 11.0 ppm confirmed the carboxylic acid proton. The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm) are the classic pattern for a 1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring. This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid and eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which would have a more complex splitting pattern.\n\nThe script correctly concluded that only one candidate, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, survived all the constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>"
