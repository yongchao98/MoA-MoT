    "Answering this question involves understanding the rules of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics, specifically the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    *   First, we will enumerate all possible uncoupled basis states, $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$, which can be formed from two p-orbitals ($l_1=1, l_2=1$). These are our initial hypotheses.\n    *   Next, we will apply the fundamental constraint of angular momentum addition: the total magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m = m_1 + m_2$. We will filter our hypotheses, keeping only those that can contribute to the given coupled state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$.\n    *   Finally, we will check if the specific measurement outcome of interest, corresponding to $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$, is among the surviving, valid hypotheses.\n    *   Based on this, we will determine its probability and select the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_angular_momentum_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quantum mechanics problem by enumerating hypotheses (possible measurement outcomes)\n    and pruning them with the constraints of angular momentum coupling.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Problem Definition ---\n    # Two electrons in p-orbitals means l1=1 and l2=1.\n    # The system is in the coupled state |l, m> = |2, -1>.\n    l1 = 1\n    l2 = 1\n    l_total = 2\n    m_total = -1\n\n    # The measurement is for L_1z and L_2z eigenvalues of -hbar,\n    # which corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n    target_m1 = -1\n    target_m2 = -1\n\n    print(f\"Initial state of the 2-electron system: |l={l_total}, m={m_total}>\")\n    print(f\"We want to find the probability of measuring the state |m1={target_m1}, m2={target_m2}>\\n\")\n\n    # --- 1.
