The complex partially dissociates according to the equilibrium CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻. The equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the given formation constant (K_f), so K_d = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹.\n\nLet 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of dissociation, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the remaining CaY²⁻ complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nThe equilibrium expression is K_d = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻] = x² / (0.02 - x).\nBecause K_d is extremely small, we can assume that x is negligible compared to 0.02 M, simplifying the equation to K_d ≈ x² / 0.02.\n\nSolving for x:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02 = 4x10⁻¹³\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³) ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated concentration of Ca²⁺ ions matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the equilibrium problem.\n\nFirst, it established the four multiple-choice options as the initial set of hypotheses. It then used the provided information to calculate the theoretical concentration of calcium ions. The dissociation constant (K_d) for the Ca-EDTA complex was calculated as the inverse of the formation constant (K_f), yielding K_d = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹.\n\nUsing the simplified equilibrium expression K_d ≈ [Ca²⁺]² / [Ca-EDTA]₀, the script calculated the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions as:\n[Ca²⁺] = √(K_d * [Ca-EDTA]₀) = √(2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ * 0.02) ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis calculated value was then compared against the initial hypotheses. The value from hypothesis C (6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M) was a near-perfect match. The script correctly pruned the other options and selected C as the final answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
