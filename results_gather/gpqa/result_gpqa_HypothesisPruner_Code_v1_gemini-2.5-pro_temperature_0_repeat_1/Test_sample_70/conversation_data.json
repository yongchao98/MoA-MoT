    "*   **Hypothesize:** The potential answers are the numerical ratios provided in the multiple-choice options.\n*   **Model:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance from the star (a), T_eq ∝ 1/√a. Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), P² ∝ a³. This implies a ∝ P^(2/3). Combining these relationships, we find that T_eq ∝ 1/√(P^(2/3)) = P^(-1/3).\n*   **Constraint Application:** The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2) will be (P4 / P2)^(-1/3). The problem gives the period ratio P4:P2 as 3.5:2.\n*   **Selection:** Calculate the value of (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) and find the hypothesis that most closely matches the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1.

The question provides the ratio of orbital periods for the planets, with Planet_4 having a relative period of 3.5 and Planet_2 having a relative period of 2.\n\nThe ratio of their periods is P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.\nTherefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (1.75)^(-1/3).\n\nCalculating this value gives approximately 0.829. Comparing this result to the given options, the closest value is 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The script successfully calculated the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The initial hypotheses were the four multiple-choice options: A) 0.57, B) 0.75, C) 0.83, and D) 0.69.\n2.  **Modeling and Constraints:** The core physical principle is that a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period (P), i.e., T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3). The problem provides the orbital period ratio for Planet_4 to Planet_2 as 3.5:2.\n3.  **Calculation and Pruning:** The script calculated the temperature ratio T4/T2 as (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) ≈ 0.8298.\n4.  **Selection:** This calculated value is extremely close to the value in hypothesis C (0.83). The script correctly identified C as the sole surviving candidate and the final choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
