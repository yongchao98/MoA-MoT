The reaction is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nThe threshold condition for this process is met when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the rest mass energy of the products, which is two times the electron rest mass energy ($2m_e c^2$). For a head-on collision, which provides the lowest possible threshold for $E_\\gamma$, the relationship is given by the formula:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nUsing the provided values:\n- Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n- Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nConverting this energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value of $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV corresponds to option C. The Python script formalizes this calculation, evaluates the given hypotheses, and confirms that option C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The script successfully calculated the theoretical threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to undergo pair production with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon.\n\nThe process involved:\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The four multiple-choice options were treated as candidate hypotheses.\n2.  **Constraint Application:** The physical constraint is the energy threshold for the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. For a head-on collision, this threshold is given by the formula $E_{\\gamma} = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_{CMB}$.\n3.  **Calculation:** Using the electron rest mass energy ($m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV}$) and the average CMB photon energy ($E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$), the script calculated the threshold energy to be approximately $2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$.\n4.  **Selection:** This calculated value was compared to the hypotheses. Option C ($2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$) was found to be an almost perfect match to the calculated value.\n\nThe code correctly identified the surviving candidate and selected the final choice based on this physical calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
