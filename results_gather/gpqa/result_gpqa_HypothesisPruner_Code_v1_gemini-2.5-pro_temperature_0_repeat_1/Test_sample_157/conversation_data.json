    "Here is a plan for solving the problem:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** Represent the four multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) as candidate hypotheses. Each hypothesis will include its proposed molecular effect and the resulting phenotype.\n*   **Constraint Definition:** Define constraints based on the biological principles described in the question. The key constraints are that the mutation is (1) dominant-negative, which implies a loss-of-function phenotype, and (2) the mutant protein must interfere with the wild-type protein, a mechanism made possible by its location in the dimerization domain.\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** Apply the constraints sequentially to the list of hypotheses. First, filter out any hypotheses that do not match the expected loss-of-function phenotype. Second, filter the remaining candidates based on whether the proposed molecular mechanism correctly explains a dominant-negative effect for a dimeric protein.\n*   **Final Selection:** From the surviving hypotheses, select the most likely option. This may involve a tie-breaking consideration, such as which option provides the most precise and complete description of the molecular events.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    # 1.

This eliminated option A (\"wild-type phenotype\") and option B (\"gain-of-function phenotype\"). Options C and D survived this filter.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Mechanism):** The script then evaluated if the mechanism could explain how a mutant protein interferes with a wild-type protein in a dimer. Both \"protein aggregation\" (Option C) and \"protein degradation\" (Option D) are valid mechanisms for interference, where the mutant protein could form a faulty dimer with the wild-type protein, leading to either aggregation or degradation of the complex. Both C and D survived this filter.\n4.  **Final Selection:** With two plausible options remaining, the script made a final selection based on the precision of the language. Option D describes the outcome as a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele,\" which is the textbook definition of a dominant-negative effect. This is more precise than Option C's more general \"loss-of-function phenotype.\" Therefore, the script selected D as the most likely and best-described answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully analyzed the problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by creating four hypotheses corresponding to the multiple-choice options A, B, C, and D.\n*   **Constraint Application:**\n    1.  The first constraint was that a dominant-negative mutation must result in a loss-of-function phenotype. This correctly eliminated options A (wild-type phenotype) and B (gain-of-function phenotype).\n    2.  The second constraint required a mechanism that explains how the mutant protein interferes with the wild-type protein. Both surviving options, C (protein aggregation) and D (protein degradation), describe plausible interference mechanisms for a dimeric protein, so both C and D passed this filter.\n*   **Final Selection:** With two valid candidates remaining (C and D), the script selected D as the best choice. The reasoning was that option D's description of the phenotype as a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" is a more precise and accurate definition of a dominant-negative effect than the more general \"loss-of-function phenotype\" in option C. The mutant protein dimerizes with the wild-type protein, and this non-functional complex is then targeted for degradation, effectively poisoning the function of the protein produced from the normal allele.\n\n<<<D>>>"
