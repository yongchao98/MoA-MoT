    "*   **Plan**\n    *   First, deduce the structures of the reactants and the reaction type. The NMR data for the anhydride strongly suggests it is maleic anhydride, and the reaction with a diene is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n    *   Second, generate the two possible stereoisomeric products of the Diels-Alder reaction: the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) adducts. Define the key proton groups in these products and their expected NMR characteristics.\n    *   Third, model the spatial relationships (NOE interactions) between these proton groups for both the *endo* and *exo* structures. A key NOE is one that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n    *   Finally, evaluate the given options (A, B, C, D) against this model to find the pair of resonances connected by such a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    # Step 1: Build Candidate Hypotheses (Reactants and Products)\n    # Based on the problem description, the reactants are deduced.\n    # Anhydride: 1H NMR (1 peak, 7ppm), 13C NMR (2 peaks, 137, 165ppm) -> Maleic Anhydride (C4H2O3)\n    # Diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14)\n    # Reaction: Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    # Product Formula: C4H2O3 + C9H14 = C13H16O3.

It established the two product hypotheses: the major *endo* adduct and the minor *exo* adduct. It defined the four key types of protons present in the products and their expected NMR signals.\n\n2.  **Constraint Filtering:** The script modeled the spatial proximities for pairs of protons corresponding to each multiple-choice option. It then filtered these options based on the crucial constraint from the problem: the NOESY cross-peak must be present for the major (*endo*) product and absent for the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The evaluation showed that only one option satisfied the constraint:\n    *   **Option A & B** were eliminated because the distances are independent of the *endo*/*exo* stereochemistry.\n    *   **Option C** was eliminated because the NOE is expected for the minor (*exo*) product, not the major one.\n    *   **Option D** was the only one that matched the data. The protons on the anhydride ring (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm) in the *endo* adduct, but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n\nThe script's output clearly labels option D as the sole surviving candidate and the final choice.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The analysis correctly identified the reaction as a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: the major *endo* adduct and the minor *exo* adduct. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space. The problem states this cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product.\n\nThe script evaluated the spatial relationships for each option:\n*   In the major (*endo*) adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring. This arrangement brings the two anhydride protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with one of the protons on the C7 bridge (1H doublet, ~1.5 ppm). This would produce a NOESY cross-peak.\n*   In the minor (*exo*) adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned \"away\" from the C7 bridge. The distance between the anhydride protons and the bridge proton is too large for a significant NOE interaction, so the cross-peak would be absent.\n\nThis perfectly matches the experimental observation. The interaction described in option D (a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) is unique to the major (*endo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
