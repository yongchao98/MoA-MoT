    "Here is a brief plan to solve the problem:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** Define the four possible options (A, B, C, D) as the initial set of hypotheses. Each option specifies the stereochemistry (R or S) for starting materials A and B.\n*   **Constraint Analysis:** Analyze the two chemical reactions. Determine the selectivity of each reducing agent (LiBH4 and BH3) and how the reaction affects the stereocenter. The key insight is that neither reaction pathway inverts the stereocenter.\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** Apply the constraints derived from the reaction analysis to filter the initial hypotheses.\n    *   Constraint 1: The reaction of A with LiBH4 produces an (R) product. Since stereochemistry is retained, starting material A must be (R).\n    *   Constraint 2: The reaction of B with BH3 produces an (S) product. Since stereochemistry is retained, starting material B must be (S).\n*   **Conclusion:** Identify the single hypothesis that satisfies both constraints and declare it as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the stereochemistry problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

It then applies two constraints based on the known selectivity of the reducing agents LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n1.  **Reaction A:** LiBH4 reduces the ester. The reaction retains the stereochemistry at the chiral center. Since the product is (R), the starting material A must also be (R). This prunes options B and C.\n2.  **Reaction B:** BH3 reduces the carboxylic acid. This reaction also retains the stereochemistry. Since the product is (S), the starting material B must also be (S). This prunes option A from the remaining candidates.\n\nThe only hypothesis that satisfies both constraints is D, where A is (R) and B is (S).\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by enumerating the four possible options and pruning them based on chemical constraints.\n\n*   **Hypotheses:** The four options (A, B, C, D) were defined as the initial set of hypotheses, each specifying the stereochemistry for starting materials A and B.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Reaction A):** The reaction of starting material A with LiBH₄ produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes. This reaction pathway retains the stereochemistry of the chiral center. Therefore, to obtain an (R) product, starting material A must have the (R) configuration. This constraint eliminated options B and C.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Reaction B):** The reaction of starting material B with BH₃ produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid to an alcohol, which then cyclizes. This reaction also retains the stereochemistry. Therefore, to obtain an (S) product, starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Applying this to the remaining candidates (A and D) eliminated option A.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only hypothesis that satisfied both constraints was D, where starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
