    "*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The possible factors by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 are the given options: ~0.7, ~0.4, ~1.2, and ~0.6. These are our initial hypotheses.\n*   **Constraint Formulation:** The total mass (M) of a double-lined, eclipsing spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities of its components (K1, K2). The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law: M ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³. The \"eclipsing\" nature of the systems implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin³(i) ≈ 1, simplifying the full equation.\n*   **Calculation and Pruning:** We will calculate the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2 using the formula: `Ratio = (P1 * (K1_1 + K2_1)³) / (P2 * (K1_2 + K2_2)³)`.\n*   **Selection:** The calculated ratio will be compared against the initial hypotheses to find the closest match, which will be our final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
