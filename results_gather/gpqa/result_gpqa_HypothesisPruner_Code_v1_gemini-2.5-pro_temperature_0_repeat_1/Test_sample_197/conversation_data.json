    "My plan is as follows:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The candidate hypotheses are the percentages provided in the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n*   **Constraint Formulation:** The primary constraint is derived from the chemical equilibrium principles governing complex formation. The percentage of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)₂], can be calculated using the formula for the distribution coefficient (α₂), which depends on the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the overall stability constants (β values). The formula is: % = 100 * (β₂[L]²) / (1 + β₁[L] + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴), where L = [SCN⁻].\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** I will calculate the theoretical percentage using the given values. Then, I will compare this calculated result against the candidate hypotheses.\n*   **Selection:** The hypothesis that numerically matches the calculated result will be selected as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the cobalt-thiocyanate complex problem by:\n    1.

The stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) are given.\n\nThe script executes the following steps:\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The multiple-choice options (A: 25.6%, B: 42.3%, C: 38.1%, D: 16.9%) are treated as the initial set of hypotheses.\n2.  **Calculation (Constraint):** The percentage of any cobalt-containing species can be found using the distribution coefficient formula, αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ), where L is the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M) and β₀ = 1.\n    *   The denominator is calculated as: 1 + β₁[L]¹ + β₂[L]² + β₃[L]³ + β₄[L]⁴ = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)² + 63(0.1)³ + 16(0.1)⁴ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n    *   The numerator for the species of interest, [Co(SCN)₂], is β₂[L]² = 40(0.1)² = 0.4.\n    *   The fraction α₂ is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916.\n    *   The calculated percentage is 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%.\n3.  **Pruning and Selection:** The calculated value of 16.92% is compared to the hypotheses. Option D (16.9%) is an excellent match.\n\nThe script confirms this calculation and identifies option D as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The provided Python script successfully solved the chemistry problem by calculating the theoretical percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\nThe script first established the multiple-choice options as the initial hypotheses. It then applied the principles of chemical equilibrium to calculate the expected percentage. The formula for the distribution coefficient (α₂) was used with the given ligand concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M) and stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄).\n\nThe calculation resulted in a theoretical percentage of approximately 16.916%. When this result was compared against the initial hypotheses, option D (16.9%) was identified as the correct match, surviving the pruning process. The script's final output confirms that D is the selected answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
