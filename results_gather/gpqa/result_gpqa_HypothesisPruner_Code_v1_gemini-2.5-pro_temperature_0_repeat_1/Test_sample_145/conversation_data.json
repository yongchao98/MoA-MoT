    "*   **Plan:**\n    *   First, create a set of candidate hypotheses representing the four possible stereoisomeric products given in the options. Each hypothesis will be characterized by its stereochemistry: *endo* or *exo* addition, and whether the fluorine atom is *syn* or *anti* relative to the anhydride ring.\n    *   Apply the first constraint: The Diels-Alder reaction is kinetically controlled and proceeds preferentially via an *endo* transition state due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This is known as the *endo* rule. We will filter out the *exo* products.\n    *   Apply the second constraint: The dienophile (maleic anhydride) will approach the diene from the face opposite to the fluorine substituent to minimize steric and electronic repulsion. This is called *anti*-attack. This results in a product where the fluorine atom is *syn* to the anhydride ring. We will filter the remaining candidates for this feature.\n    *   The single remaining candidate after applying both constraints will be the major product.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef solve_diels_alder():\n    # Step 1: Enumerate Hypotheses\n    # The four options represent the four possible stereoisomers from the reaction.\n    # We can classify them based on two key stereochemical outcomes:\n    # 1.

The major product is determined by the kinetic pathway, which follows two key stereochemical principles.\n\n1.  **The Endo Rule:** The reaction proceeds preferentially through an *endo* transition state, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride moiety) are positioned under the pi system of the diene. This eliminates the *exo* products (Options B and C).\n\n2.  **Facial Selectivity:** The dienophile (maleic anhydride) approaches the diene from the sterically and electronically less hindered face. This is the face *anti* (opposite) to the fluorine substituent on the C5 carbon. This *anti*-attack results in a product where the fluorine atom is *syn* (on the same side) relative to the anhydride ring. This eliminates the product where the fluorine is *anti* (Option A).\n\nCombining these two principles, the major product must be the *endo* adduct with a *syn*-fluorine. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully determined the major product by systematically applying established principles of stereochemistry in the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n1.  **Enumeration of Hypotheses:** The script began by defining the four possible products (A, B, C, D) and classifying them based on their stereochemistry:\n    *   **Addition type:** *endo* (A, D) vs. *exo* (B, C).\n    *   **Facial selectivity:** The approach of the dienophile relative to the fluorine substituent, leading to a final product where the fluorine is either *syn* (B, D) or *anti* (A, C) to the anhydride ring.\n\n2.  **Pruning with Constraint 1 (The Endo Rule):** The script applied the endo rule, which states that the kinetically favored product in a Diels-Alder reaction arises from *endo* addition. This correctly eliminated the *exo* products, options B and C, leaving A and D as possibilities.\n\n3.  **Pruning with Constraint 2 (Facial Selectivity):** The script then considered the approach of the dienophile. To minimize steric and electronic repulsion, the maleic anhydride attacks the diene from the face *anti* (opposite) to the fluorine atom. This *anti*-attack pathway results in a product where the fluorine atom is *syn* (on the same side) relative to the newly formed anhydride ring. This constraint eliminated option A, which has an *anti*-fluorine.\n\n4.  **Final Choice:** The only candidate that survived both filters was option D. It is the *endo* adduct resulting from *anti*-attack, making it the major kinetic product of the reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
