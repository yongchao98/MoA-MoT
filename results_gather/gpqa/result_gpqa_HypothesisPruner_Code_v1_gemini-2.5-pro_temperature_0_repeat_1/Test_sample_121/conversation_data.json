The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This conformational averaging creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), and the substituents on C1.\n\nThis symmetry has the following consequences:\n*   The protons of the ethyl group give **2 signals** (one for the -CH3 and one for the -OCH2-).\n*   The ring carbons C2 and C6 are equivalent, as are C3 and C5.\n*   At positions C2 and C6, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic, resulting in **2 signals**.\n*   At positions C3 and C5, the axial and equatorial protons are also diastereotopic, giving another **2 signals**.\n*   At position C4, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic, giving a final **2 signals**.\n\nSumming these up: 2 (ethyl) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The Python script successfully determined the structure of the final product and analyzed its symmetry to predict the number of 1H NMR signals.\n\n1.  **Reaction Sequence Analysis:** The script correctly identified the final product as **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**. This is formed by the reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with 1,5-dibromopentane, which acts as a five-carbon electrophile to form a six-membered ring.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:** The key constraint applied was the rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring. This conformational averaging establishes a time-averaged plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4.\n3.  **Signal Enumeration:** Based on this symmetry, the script correctly enumerated the distinct proton environments:\n    *   **Ethyl Group:** 2 signals (the triplet for -CH3 and the quartet for -OCH2-).\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5. However, the protons on each of these carbons (axial vs. equatorial) are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. This results in:\n        *   2 signals for the C2/C6 protons.\n        *   2 signals for the C3/C5 protons.\n        *   2 signals for the C4 protons.\n    *   **Total:** 2 (ethyl) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 8 signals.\n\nThe final count of 8 distinct hydrogen signals matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
