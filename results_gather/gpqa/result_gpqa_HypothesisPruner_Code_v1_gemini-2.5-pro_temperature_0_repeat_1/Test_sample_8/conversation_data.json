Its symmetry is likely **C3** or lower.\n3.  **Benzo[...]trifuran[...]hexaone** (mellitic trianhydride) is planar (possessing a σh) and has a C3 axis. However, it also has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, which places it in the **D3h** point group.\n4.  **Triphenyleno[...]trifuran[...]hexaone** is a larger, planar molecule. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and the plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Crucially, it lacks the perpendicular C2 axes found in the previous molecule. The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane (and no other elements that would raise it to a higher symmetry group like D3h) means it has **C3h** symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is the only molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>",
