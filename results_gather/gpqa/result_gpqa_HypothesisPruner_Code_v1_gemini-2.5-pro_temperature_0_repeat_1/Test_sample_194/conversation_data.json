    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the Python code block.\n\nHere is a brief plan for solving the problem:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The primary hypotheses are the possible maximum orbital periods for the second planet. We will derive a theoretical value based on the physical laws governing planetary orbits and transits.\n*   **Constraint Application:** The core constraint is that both planets share the same orbital inclination (`i`) because they are in the same plane. A second constraint is that for the second planet to have its maximum possible period while still transiting, it must be at the edge of the transiting zone, meaning its impact parameter (`b`) must be at its maximum value, which is `b_max = 1`.\n*   **Derivation and Calculation:** We will use the data from the first planet to find a relationship involving the orbital inclination. Then, we will apply this relationship to the second planet at its maximum transit impact parameter to find its maximum semi-major axis (`a_max`). Finally, Kepler's Third Law will be used to calculate the corresponding maximum orbital period.\n*   **Selection:** The calculated period will be compared against the provided options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_period():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the maximum orbital period of a second planet in a system.\n    \n    The solution proceeds by enumerating hypotheses and pruning them with constraints.\n    1.  Hypothesis: There is a maximum orbital period for the second planet that allows\n        it to transit. We can calculate this value.\n    2.  Constraint 1: Both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their\n        orbital inclination 'i' relative to the observer is identical.\n    3.  Constraint 2: The impact parameter 'b' is defined as b = (a/R_star) * cos(i),\n        where 'a' is the semi-major axis and 'R_star' is the stellar radius.\n    4.  Constraint 3: For a transit to occur, the impact parameter 'b' must be <= 1.\n        The maximum period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis 'a', which\n        in turn corresponds to the maximum allowed impact parameter, b_max = 1.\n    5.  Pruning/Calculation: We use the parameters of Planet 1 to find a value for\n        the term (cos(i) / R_star). We then use this value with the maximum impact\n        parameter for Planet 2 to find its maximum semi-major axis relative to\n        Planet 1.

The key insight is that the orbital inclination is the same for both planets. Using the data for the first planet, we establish a relationship between its semi-major axis and the system's inclination. We then apply this to the second planet at its limiting case for a transit (impact parameter `b=1`). This determines the maximum semi-major axis for the second planet. Finally, Kepler's Third Law relates this maximum axis to a maximum orbital period. The calculation yields a result of approximately 33.54 days, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully calculated the maximum orbital period for the second planet.\n\nThe method involved these key steps:\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The candidate answers (A, B, C, D) were treated as the initial hypotheses for the maximum period.\n2.  **Constraints:** The primary constraint is that both planets share the same orbital plane, meaning their inclination (`i`) is identical. For the second planet to have its maximum period while still transiting, it must be at the edge of the transit zone, which corresponds to a maximum impact parameter (`b_max`) of 1.\n3.  **Calculation:** The relationship `b = (a/R_star) * cos(i)` was used. Since `cos(i)` and `R_star` are constant for the system, it follows that `a` is proportional to `b`. This gives the ratio of the semi-major axes: `a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1 = 1.0 / 0.2 = 5`. Using Kepler's Third Law, `(P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3`, the maximum period for the second planet was calculated as `P2_max = P1 * (a2_max/a1)^(3/2) = 3.0 * 5^(1.5) ≈ 33.54` days.\n4.  **Selection:** The calculated value of ~33.54 days is closest to option B. The information about the planet and star radii was not needed for this specific calculation, as the relationship relies on the ratios of orbital parameters.\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation, showing the surviving candidate value is 33.5410 days, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
