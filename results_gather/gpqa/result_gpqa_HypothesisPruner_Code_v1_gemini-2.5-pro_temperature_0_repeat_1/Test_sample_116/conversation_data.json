    "*   **Plan:**\n    *   Define a set of hypotheses representing all possible combinations of optically active compounds from the list.\n    *   For each compound, determine if it meets the criteria for optical isomerism (chirality). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n    *   Filter the hypotheses based on the analysis of each compound. Compound 1 is a substituted biphenyl with bulky ortho groups, causing restricted rotation and axial chirality. Compound 2 has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, making it a chiral center. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to planes of symmetry and/or a center of inversion.\n    *   Select the hypothesis that correctly identifies all optically active compounds and matches one of the given options.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses\n# The hypotheses are the possible answers provided in the multiple-choice question.\n# Each hypothesis is a set of compound numbers that are proposed to be optically active.\nhypotheses = {\n    \"A\": {3, 4},\n    \"B\": {1, 2},\n    \"C\": {1, 2, 4},\n    \"D\": {2, 3}\n}\n\n# Define the compounds and their properties relevant to chirality\nCompound = collections.namedtuple('Compound', ['id', 'name', 'is_chiral', 'reason'])\ncompounds = [\n    Compound(1, \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\", True, \"Atropisomerism due to bulky ortho-substituents restricting rotation.\"),\n    Compound(2, \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", True, \"Contains a chiral carbon (C2) bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3).\"),\n    Compound(3, \"benzophenone\", False, \"Achiral; has a plane of symmetry passing through the C=O bond.\"),\n    Compound(4, \"dimethyl fumarate\", False, \"Achiral; has a center of inversion and is planar around the double bond.\")\n]\n\nprint(\"--- Initial Hypotheses ---\")\nfor key, value in hypotheses.items():\n    print(f\"Hypothesis {key}: Compounds {value} are optically active.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 25)\n\n# Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n# The constraint is that a compound must be chiral to show optical isomerism.\n# We will build a set of the actual optically active compounds based on our analysis.\nsurviving_candidates = set()\nprint(\"--- Applying Chirality Constraint ---\")\nfor c in compounds:\n    if c.is_chiral:\n        print(f\"PASS: Compound {c.id} ({c.name}) is chiral.

The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') prevent free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This makes C2 a chiral center, and the molecule is therefore chiral and optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: This molecule (C6H5-CO-C6H5) is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the carbonyl group (C=O). Since it possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond and possesses a center of inversion. It is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are optically active. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The script analyzed four compounds to determine which exhibit optical isomerism. A compound must be chiral (lacking a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) to be optically active.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The analysis correctly identified this molecule as chiral. The bulky groups at the ortho positions restrict rotation around the central single bond, leading to a stable, non-superimposable mirror image (atropisomerism). Thus, it is optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The script correctly identified that the second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3), making it a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: This molecule was correctly identified as achiral because it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the carbonyl group. It is not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule was correctly identified as achiral. As a *trans*-alkene, it possesses a center of inversion and is planar, making it superimposable on its mirror image. It is not optically active.\n\nThe code concluded that the set of optically active compounds is {1, 2}. This set matches hypothesis B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
