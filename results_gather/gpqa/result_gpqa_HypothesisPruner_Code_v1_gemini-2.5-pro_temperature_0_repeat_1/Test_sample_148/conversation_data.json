    "An brief plan for solving the problem is as follows:\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** Create a list of potential explanations for the observations. These will be based on the multiple-choice options provided: A) Diastereoisomers, B) Enantiomers, C) Precursor contamination, D) 'Double coupling' side product. A fifth, more specific hypothesis, rotamerism, will also be considered as it is a common phenomenon in peptides.\n*   **Constraint Definition:** Extract the key experimental observations from the problem description to use as filters. These are: 1) Two NMR peaks for one alpha-proton, 2) Two LC peaks of equal intensity, 3) Both peaks have the same mass, consistent with the target molecule.\n*   **Pruning:** Systematically apply each constraint to the list of hypotheses. A hypothesis is eliminated if it contradicts any of the experimental observations.\n*   **Conclusion:** Identify the single hypothesis that remains consistent with all constraints and select the corresponding multiple-choice answer.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    # 1.

These rotamers (e.g., *cis* and *trans* forms) are a specific type of diastereoisomer. They are distinct chemical species that are not mirror images of each other.\n\n1.  **Same Mass:** The LC-MS data shows two peaks with identical mass spectra, confirming they are isomers of the same molecule. This rules out contamination with a precursor (C) or a side product from 'double coupling' (D), both of which would have different masses.\n2.  **Separable by NMR and LC:** The presence of two distinct peaks in both the NMR spectrum (for the alpha-proton) and the LC chromatogram indicates the presence of two separable species. Enantiomers (B) are chemically identical in achiral environments and would not be resolved by standard NMR or LC techniques. Diastereoisomers (A), however, have different physical and chemical properties and are separable.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since rotamers are a type of diastereoisomer, and the evidence strongly points to rotamerism, the most accurate and encompassing answer among the choices is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script began by listing all possible explanations provided in the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) and added a more specific, relevant hypothesis: the presence of rotational isomers (rotamers), which are common in peptides.\n2.  **Pruning with Constraints:**\n    *   **Constraint 1 (Same Mass):** The LC-MS data showed both peaks have the same mass. This eliminated Hypothesis C (precursor contamination) and Hypothesis D ('double coupling' side product), as both would result in molecules with different masses.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Separable by NMR/LC):** The observation of two distinct peaks in both NMR and standard LC eliminated Hypothesis B (enantiomers). Enantiomers are not separable by achiral analytical techniques.\n3.  **Final Selection:** The only remaining valid hypothesis was A (diastereoisomers). The script correctly reasoned that the specific observations in a peptide context strongly point to the presence of rotamers (e.g., *cis/trans* isomers of an amide bond). Since rotamers are a specific type of diastereoisomer, Hypothesis A is the correct and most encompassing answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
