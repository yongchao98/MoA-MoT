Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\nB) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\nC) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt.

The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "The Python script successfully executed the planned process. It began by enumerating the four provided statements (A, B, C, D) as distinct hypotheses. It then applied constraints derived from established knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology to filter these hypotheses.\n\nThe script's internal logic correctly identified that statements A, C, and D are accurate descriptions of viral processes:\n*   **A:** Correctly links ORF3a to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n*   **C:** Correctly describes the relationship between pseudoknot dynamics and frameshifting efficiency.\n*   **D:** Correctly outlines the general mechanism of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting in coronaviruses.\n\nThe script filtered out these correct statements and identified hypothesis B as the incorrect one. The reasoning provided is that statement B mischaracterizes the function of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. While this complex is indeed a proofreading exonuclease involved in mismatch repair, its primary role is to ensure the fidelity of RNA replication by removing mismatched nucleotides, not to \"prevent the breakdown of dsRNA.\" Therefore, statement B is the exception among the correct statements.\n\n<<<B>>>"
