It almost always refers to a failed attempt at separation using chromatography, such as Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography. In these techniques, compounds are separated based on their differing polarities, which dictates how strongly they adhere to the stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) versus moving with the mobile phase (the solvent).\n\nIf two compounds have very similar polarities, they will move at nearly the same rate. On a TLC plate, this results in their respective spots overlapping, appearing visually \"on top of each other.\" This makes it impossible to isolate the desired product from starting materials or byproducts, hence the chemist's frustration. The other options are less likely: similar boiling points relate to distillation, and the phrasing is less common; similar optical rotations are a measurement issue, not a separation one; and non-covalent interactions are a fundamental property, not a specific experimental failure.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the most plausible answer by interpreting a common piece of laboratory jargon.\n\nThe initial hypotheses were the four multiple-choice options. The script applied the constraint that the phrase \"on top of each other\" is a well-known idiom in synthetic chemistry labs. This phrase is most frequently used to describe a failed separation using chromatography (like Thin-Layer Chromatography or column chromatography).\n\nThe script pruned the other options because:\n*   **A (non-covalent interactions):** This is too general. While these interactions cause polarity, \"similar polarity\" is the direct reason for the failed separation.\n*   **C (similar optical rotations):** This is a measurement issue, not a physical separation problem.\n*   **D (similar boiling points):** This relates to distillation. The visual metaphor of being \"on top of each other\" is much more strongly associated with overlapping spots on a chromatography plate.\n\nThe surviving candidate, **B (The compounds have similar polarities)**, perfectly matches the constraint. In chromatography, compounds are separated based on polarity. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will not separate effectively, and their spots or bands will overlap, leading a chemist to say they are \"on top of each other.\"\n\n<<<B>>>"
