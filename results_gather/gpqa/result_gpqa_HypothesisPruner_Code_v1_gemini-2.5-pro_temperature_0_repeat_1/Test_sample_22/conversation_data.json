    "*   **Hypothesis Generation:** The four options (A, B, C, D) serve as the initial set of hypotheses for the reaction products. Each option proposes a pair of chemical structures.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The primary constraints are the known chemical reactions of the starting material, ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The most reactive functional group is the alkene (C=C double bond). The key reaction is the electrophilic addition of HBr across this double bond.\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** We will evaluate each hypothesis against established reaction mechanisms.\n    *   Addition of HBr to an unsymmetrical alkene can yield two constitutional isomers: the Markovnikov product (from the more stable carbocation intermediate) and the anti-Markovnikov product (often via a radical mechanism).\n    *   Other reactions like ether cleavage, intramolecular cyclization, or complex rearrangements are possible but are often secondary to or in competition with the simple addition reaction. Hypotheses requiring unlikely transformations (e.g., reduction without a reducing agent) will be eliminated.\n*   **Selection:** The hypothesis that aligns best with the most common and direct reaction pathway will be selected as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef run_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates and prunes hypotheses for a chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

The addition of HBr to an unsymmetrical alkene can proceed via two main pathways, leading to two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers).\n\n1.  **Markovnikov Addition:** In this ionic mechanism, the proton (H+) from HBr adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (C4) to form the more stable carbocation (a secondary carbocation at C3). The bromide ion (Br-) then attacks this carbocation, yielding **(3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**.\n2.  **Anti-Markovnikov Addition:** This reaction typically proceeds via a free-radical mechanism, which can be initiated by trace amounts of peroxides or light. The bromine radical (Br•) adds to the less substituted carbon (C4), and a hydrogen atom is subsequently abstracted from HBr by the carbon radical at C3. This pathway yields **(4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene**.\n\nThe observation of two new spots on the TLC plate strongly suggests that a mixture of these two products was formed. Option C lists exactly these two products. The other options are less likely: Option B requires an unsupported reduction and rearrangement, Option D involves more complex cyclizations that compete with the simpler addition, and Option A pairs one addition product with an isomerization product, which is a less direct explanation than the formation of both addition isomers.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The script successfully analyzed the chemical reaction based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The four multiple-choice options were correctly identified as the initial set of hypotheses.\n2.  **Constraint Application & Pruning:** The script correctly identified that the primary reaction is the addition of HBr across the alkene double bond. It correctly pruned Hypothesis B, as HBr is not a reducing agent. It then reasoned that the most direct and common outcome of adding HBr to an unsymmetrical alkene is the formation of a mixture of the two possible regioisomers (Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov products).\n3.  **Selection:** The script correctly concluded that Hypothesis C, which lists both the Markovnikov product ((3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene) and the anti-Markovnikov product ((4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene), provides the most plausible explanation for the observation of two new product spots on the TLC plate.\n\nThe analysis aligns with established chemical reaction mechanisms. The formation of two constitutional isomers from the addition of HBr across an unsymmetrical alkene is a classic example taught in introductory organic chemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
