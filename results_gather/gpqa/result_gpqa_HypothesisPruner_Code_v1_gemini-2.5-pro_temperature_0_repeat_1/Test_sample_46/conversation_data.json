    "An initial plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C9H11NO2 to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n*   Analyze the IR spectrum to identify key functional groups, such as N-H bonds from an amine/amide and a C=O bond from a carbonyl.\n*   Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum to identify the carbon skeleton, specifically looking at the ethyl group, the nature of the aromatic ring substitution, and the protons corresponding to the nitrogen-containing group.\n*   Systematically evaluate each of the four candidate structures against the combined spectral data to find the one that is a perfect match.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a string buffer to capture output\ncaptured_output = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output\n\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    # Step 1: Define candidate hypotheses\n    candidates = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\",\n            \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n            \"amine_type\": \"primary\",  # -NH2\n            \"carbonyl_freq_cm-1\": \"ester (~1725-1700)\",\n            \"aromatic_pattern\": \"para\", # 1,4-disubstituted\n            \"alkyl_group\": \"ethoxy\", # -OCH2CH3\n            \"other_protons\": [\"-NH2 (2H)\"]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"B) 4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n            \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n            \"amine_type\": \"primary\", # -NH2\n            \"carbonyl_freq_cm-1\": \"ester (~1760)\", # Phenyl ester is higher\n            \"aromatic_pattern\": \"para\",\n            \"alkyl_group\": \"propionyl\", # -C(=O)CH2CH3\n            \"other_protons\": [\"-NH2 (2H)\"]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"C) 3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n            \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n            \"amine_type\": \"primary_amide\", # -CONH2\n            \"carbonyl_freq_cm-1\": \"amide (~1690-1650)\",\n            \"aromatic_pattern\": \"meta\", # 1,3-disubstituted\n            \"alkyl_group\": \"ethoxy\",\n            \"other_protons\": [\"-CONH2 (2H)\"]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n            \"formula\": \"C9H11NO2\",\n            \"amine_type\": \"secondary_amide\", # -NH-\n            \"carbonyl_freq_cm-1\": \"amide (~1690-1650)\",\n            \"aromatic_pattern\": \"para\",\n            \"alkyl_group\": \"ethoxy\",\n            \"other_protons\": [\"-NH- (1H)\", \"-CHO (1H)\"]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"--- Building Candidate Hypotheses ---\")\n    for c in candidates:\n        print(f\"Candidate: {c['name']}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n    survivors = list(candidates)\n    print(\"\\n--- Applying Constraints ---\")\n\n    # Constraint 1: IR N-H stretch (3420, 3325 cm-1) indicates a primary amine or primary amide (-NH2).\n    # This means two N-H bonds.

This constraint prunes candidate C.\n    *   The 1H NMR aromatic pattern of two doublets is indicative of a 1,4-(para)-disubstituted benzene ring. This is inconsistent with candidate C (meta-substituted).\n    *   The 1H NMR signals for an ethyl group (triplet at 1.20 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm) specifically point to an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃), where the CH₂ is attached to an oxygen. This eliminates candidate B, which has a propionyl group where the CH₂ would appear at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n    *   The broad 2H singlet at 4.0 ppm is consistent with the -NH₂ group protons.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Only candidate A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, survives all the filters. It has a primary amine, an ester carbonyl, a para-disubstituted ring, and an ethoxy group, matching all provided data.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the correct compound by systematically eliminating candidates that did not match the provided spectral data.\n\n*   **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with four potential structures: A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, B) 4-aminophenyl propionate, C) 3-ethoxybenzamide, and D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **Constraint Filtering:**\n    1.  The two N-H bands in the IR spectrum (3420, 3325 cm⁻¹) indicated a primary amine (-NH₂), eliminating candidate D (a secondary amide).\n    2.  The C=O band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an ester, eliminating candidate C (an amide).\n    3.  The two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum confirmed a para-substituted ring, which was consistent with the remaining candidates A and B.\n    4.  The ¹H NMR signals for an ethoxy group (triplet at 1.20 ppm, quartet at 4.5 ppm) were a perfect match for candidate A. Candidate B has a propionyl group, which would show different chemical shifts. This step eliminated candidate B.\n*   **Conclusion:** After applying all constraints, only candidate A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, remained. It is fully consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
