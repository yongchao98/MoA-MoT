A di-substituted aromatic ring (C6H4), an ester group (-COO-), and the 1H NMR signals are key. The two vinyl signals (doublet, doublet of quartets) and one of the methyl signals strongly suggest a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The second methyl signal and the ester group point to a methyl ester (-COOCH3). Assembling these fragments gives methyl propenylbenzoate (CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3). This structure contains no -CH2- groups, matching all constraints. The chemical formula for this structure is calculated by summing the atoms: C(1+2+6+1+1) H(3+1+1+4+3) O(2), which results in C11H12O2. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the chemical formula by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Hypotheses:** The initial candidates were the four chemical formulas provided: C11H12O2, C12H14O2, C11H14O2, and C12H12O2.\n*   **Constraint Analysis:** The script interpreted the spectroscopic data to identify key structural fragments: a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), an ester group (-COO-), a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), and a methyl group part of the ester (-OCH3). The absence of -CH2- signals was a crucial constraint.\n*   **Structure Deduction:** Assembling these fragments led to the structure of methyl propenylbenzoate (CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3).\n*   **Filtering:** The chemical formula for the deduced structure was calculated as C11H12O2. This formula was used to filter the initial hypotheses, leaving only C11H12O2 as the valid option.\n*   **Conclusion:** The script correctly identified C11H12O2 as the only formula consistent with all the given data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
