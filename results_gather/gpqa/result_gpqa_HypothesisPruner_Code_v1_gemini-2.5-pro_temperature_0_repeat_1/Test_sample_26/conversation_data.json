    "*   **Plan**\n*   First, create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) and contains the meeting location and the final destination.\n*   Next, define and apply constraints based on the biological clues in the riddle. The first clue (\"ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain\") points to the meeting happening in the cytosol where ribosomes are. The second set of clues (\"sugar,\" \"rough\") points to the protein entering the secretory pathway (Rough ER), which often leads to secretion outside the cell.\n*   Filter the initial list of hypotheses against these constraints, removing any that do not match the biological process described.\n*   Finally, print the surviving candidate(s) and explicitly state the chosen answer based on the filtering results.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses from the options\n# Each hypothesis is a dictionary representing an answer choice.\nhypotheses = [\n    {\"option\": \"A\", \"meeting_place\": \"ribosome\", \"destination\": \"proteasome\"},\n    {\"option\": \"B\", \"meeting_place\": \"Golgi\", \"destination\": \"mitochondrion\"},\n    {\"option\": \"C\", \"meeting_place\": \"membrane\", \"destination\": \"nucleus\"},\n    {\"option\": \"D\", \"meeting_place\": \"cytosol\", \"destination\": \"extracellular space\"},\n]\n\nprint(\"--- Initial Hypotheses ---\")\nfor h in hypotheses:\n    print(h)\n\n# Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n# Constraint 1: The \"ribonucleoprotein particle\" (Signal Recognition Particle, or SRP)\n# meets the \"nascent chain\" on a ribosome.

A \"nascent chain\" (new protein) is being synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol.\n2.  A \"ribonucleoprotein particle\" (the Signal Recognition Particle, or SRP) recognizes a signal peptide on the new protein, binds to it, and pauses translation. This meeting occurs in the **cytosol**.\n3.  The SRP guides the entire ribosome-protein complex to the \"rough\" Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n4.  The protein is inserted into the ER, where it can be modified with \"sugar\" (N-linked glycosylation).\n5.  From the ER, the protein travels through the secretory pathway (Golgi apparatus, vesicles) and is often destined for secretion out of the cell into the **extracellular space**.\n\nThe Python script correctly models this logic. It first establishes all options as hypotheses. It then prunes them using constraints derived from the riddle:\n*   The first constraint filters for a meeting place in the 'cytosol', which eliminates options A, B, and C.\n*   The second constraint requires a destination consistent with the secretory pathway initiated by the \"rough\" ER and \"sugar\" clues. The 'extracellular space' is a primary destination for this pathway.\n\nThis leaves only option D as the viable answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the riddle by systematically eliminating incorrect options based on biological clues.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with four hypotheses corresponding to the multiple-choice options A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Meeting Place):** The riddle describes a \"ribonucleoprotein particle\" meeting a \"nascent chain.\" This event, involving the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and a new protein being synthesized on a ribosome, occurs in the cytosol. The script correctly filtered the hypotheses, leaving only option D, which identifies the meeting place as the cytosol.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Destination):** The clues \"sugar\" (glycosylation) and \"rough\" (the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum) indicate the protein is entering the secretory pathway. A major final destination for proteins in this pathway is secretion from the cell. The script correctly identified that the 'extracellular space' is a valid destination for this process, confirming that option D remained the only viable candidate.\n4.  **Final Choice:** After applying both constraints, the script was left with a single surviving candidate, option D.\n\nThe logic correctly deciphers the biological process of co-translational translocation, where a protein destined for secretion is synthesized in the cytosol and then transported into the ER, eventually ending up in the extracellular space.\n\n<<<D>>>"
