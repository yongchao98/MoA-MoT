    "*   **Plan**\n    *   Define the products of each reaction based on the stereochemistry of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed ring opening. Reaction 1 (from E-alkene) produces a meso diol. Reaction 2 (from Z-alkene) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols.\n    *   Enumerate the four possible outcomes (A, B, C, D) as our initial hypotheses.\n    *   Apply two constraints based on chromatography principles:\n        1.  Standard (achiral) HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n        2.

The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer to this pair and will elute at a different time, creating a second peak. The script correctly calculates **2 peaks** for the standard HPLC.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique can separate all stereoisomers. The *meso* compound will produce one peak, and the two enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks. The script correctly calculates a total of **3 peaks** for the chiral HPLC.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The analysis concludes that there will be 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This matches the conditions of hypothesis D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully modeled the chemical problem.\n\n1.  **Product Identification:** The script correctly identified the products of the two reactions. Reaction 1, starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, yields a single *meso* compound ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) via anti-dihydroxylation. Reaction 2, starting with (Z)-oct-4-ene, yields a racemic mixture of two enantiomers ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). The final mixture contains these three stereoisomers.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates diastereomers but not enantiomers. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the two enantiomers elute as one peak, and the meso compound elutes as a second peak, resulting in a total of **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique separates all stereoisomers. The *meso* compound gives one peak, and the two enantiomers are resolved into two separate peaks, resulting in a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The script filtered the initial hypotheses and found that only option D (2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC) matched the derived constraints.\n\n<<<D>>>"
