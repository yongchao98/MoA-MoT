The initial hypotheses were the four provided options. The calculation, based on the standard formula for rhombohedral systems, yielded a value of approximately 9.54 Angstroms. By comparing this result to the initial hypotheses, the script pruned the options, identifying option D (9.54 Angstroms) as the only surviving candidate due to its near-perfect match.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The script enumerated the four multiple-choice options as initial hypotheses. It then applied the physical constraint by calculating the theoretical interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal using the formula `d_111 = a * sqrt((1 + 2*cos(alpha)) / 3)`. With the given values of `a = 10` Angstroms and `α = 30°`, the calculated distance was approximately 9.543 Angstroms.\n\nComparing this calculated value to the initial hypotheses, the script pruned the options to find the closest match. Option D (9.54 Angstroms) was identified as the surviving candidate, having a negligible difference of 0.003 from the theoretical value.\n\n<<<D>>>"
