    "*   **Plan:**\n*   First, represent the four multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) as candidate hypotheses.\n*   Analyze the first reaction: the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. This reaction requires a source of cyanide (NaCN) and an acid catalyst (H3O+) to protonate the intermediate alkoxide. This constraint will be used to filter the hypotheses based on reagent A.\n*   Analyze the second reaction: the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This is effectively achieved by heating with a strong acid catalyst like HCl. This constraint will be used to filter the remaining hypotheses based on reagent B.\n*   The hypothesis that satisfies both chemical constraints will be the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Enumerate Hypotheses\n# The hypotheses are the four options provided.\nHypothesis = collections.namedtuple('Hypothesis', ['option', 'reagent_A', 'reagent_B'])\nhypotheses = [\n    Hypothesis(option='A', reagent_A='NaHSO3', reagent_B='HCl'),\n    Hypothesis(option='B', reagent_A='NaHSO3', reagent_B='CH3COOH'),\n    Hypothesis(option='C', reagent_A='H3O+', reagent_B='CH3COOH'),\n    Hypothesis(option='D', reagent_A='H3O+', reagent_B='HCl'),\n]\n\nprint(\"--- Initial Candidate Hypotheses ---\")\nfor h in hypotheses:\n    print(h)\n\n# Step 2: Apply Constraints as Filters\n\n# Constraint 1: Reagent for cyanohydrin formation\n# Reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n# This is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to a ketone.

This pruned options A and B, which proposed NaHSO3.\n\nFor the second reaction (nitrile hydrolysis), the script evaluated the remaining options. It correctly determined that a strong acid like HCl is the standard and effective reagent for converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, whereas a weak acid like CH3COOH (acetic acid) is not. This pruned option C.\n\nOnly option D survived both constraints, making it the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully evaluated the chemical reactions and selected the appropriate reagents by eliminating incorrect options.\n\n*   **Hypotheses:** The four options (A, B, C, D) were set up as initial hypotheses.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Reaction 1):** The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. This reaction requires an acid catalyst, H3O+, to protonate the intermediate alkoxide formed after the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon. The script correctly identified that NaHSO3 is not the catalyst for this reaction, thus pruning hypotheses A and B.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Reaction 2):** The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This transformation is typically carried out under vigorous conditions, requiring a strong acid like HCl. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) is not effective enough. The script correctly applied this constraint, pruning hypothesis C.\n*   **Conclusion:** Hypothesis D was the only one to satisfy both constraints, with A = H3O+ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
