It then uses this radius to find the area of the event horizon. Finally, it applies the Bekenstein-Hawking formula to compute the black hole's entropy. The calculated entropy is approximately 4.82e+62 J/K. Comparing the order of magnitude (10^62) with the given options, the script identifies option D as the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully calculated the entropy of the supermassive black hole based on the provided observational data and physical principles.\n\n1.  **Physical Size Calculation:** Using the small-angle approximation, the script first determined the physical size of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius, `R_s`) from its angular size (`θ = 10^-17` degrees) and distance (`d = 10^10` parsecs). The result was `R_s ≈ 5.39 x 10^7` meters.\n2.  **Area Calculation:** From the radius, the surface area of the event horizon was calculated as `A = 4πR_s² ≈ 3.65 x 10^16 m²`.\n3.  **Entropy Calculation:** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, `S = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`, was applied to this area. The final calculated entropy was `S ≈ 4.82 x 10^62 J/K`.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The order of magnitude of the calculated entropy is `10^62`. Comparing this result to the given options, it directly matches the value presented in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
