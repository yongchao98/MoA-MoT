    "*   **Plan**\n    *   Hypothesize that the correct answer is one of the four provided options for the planet-to-star radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar).\n    *   Model the brightness variation caused by the rotating, spotted star. The amplitude of this variation is the relative flux difference between the unspotted view (max brightness) and the spotted view (min brightness), which can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Model the brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet. The amplitude of this signal is simply the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which is (Rpl/Rstar)².\n    *   Equate the two amplitudes and solve for the theoretical Rpl/Rstar.

It then calculates the expected brightness variation (amplitude) caused by the rotating spotted star, using the provided temperatures and spot filling factor. This results in a required signal amplitude of approximately 0.10355.\n\nNext, the script calculates the theoretical planet-to-star radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce this same amplitude during a transit. The required ratio is found to be the square root of the amplitude, which is approximately 0.3218.\n\nFinally, the script compares this calculated value to the initial hypotheses. The value from hypothesis B (0.32) is the closest match to the calculated required ratio of ~0.322.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The script successfully solved the problem by modeling the two physical scenarios and comparing the results.\n\nFirst, it calculated the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating spotted star. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness occurs when the hemisphere with 20% spot coverage faces the observer. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴), the relative amplitude of this variation was calculated to be approximately 0.1035.\n\nSecond, it modeled the brightness drop caused by a transiting exoplanet. This drop is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which simplifies to (Rpl/Rstar)².\n\nBy equating these two amplitudes, `(Rpl/Rstar)² = 0.1035`, the script solved for the required planet-to-star radius ratio, finding it to be `Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218`.\n\nFinally, this calculated value was compared against the provided options. The value from option B, 0.32, is the closest match to the calculated result of ~0.322.\n\n<<<B>>>"
