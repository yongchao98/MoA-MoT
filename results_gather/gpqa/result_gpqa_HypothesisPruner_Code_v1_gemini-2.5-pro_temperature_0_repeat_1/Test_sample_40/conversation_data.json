The speed of light in a medium moving with velocity `v` is given by the relativistic velocity-addition formula. Let the lab frame be `S` and the glass's rest frame be `S'`.\n\n1.  The velocity of the glass (`S'`) relative to the lab (`S`) is `v`.\n2.  The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's frame `S'`, is `u' = c/n`. Since `c=1`, `u' = 1/n`.\n3.  The relativistic velocity-addition formula to find the speed `u` in the lab frame `S` is: `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`.\n4.  Substituting `u' = 1/n` and `c=1`, we get: `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)`.\n5.  Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` simplifies this to: `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\nThe Python script confirms this by testing the given options against physical limiting cases:\n*   **Constraint 1 (n=1):** When the medium is a vacuum, the speed of light must be `c=1`. Hypotheses B and C fail this test.\n*   **Constraint 2 (v=0):** When the medium is stationary, the speed of light must be `c/n = 1/n`. Hypothesis D fails this test.\n\nOnly Hypothesis A, `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`, passes both constraints, matching the derived formula.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nA",
    "The Python script successfully pruned the candidate hypotheses using two physical constraints.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with four candidates: A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Vacuum, n=1):** The speed of light in a vacuum must be `c=1`, regardless of the frame's velocity. Hypotheses B and C failed this test, as they did not yield `1`. Hypotheses A and D survived.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Stationary Medium, v=0):** The speed of light in a stationary medium is `c/n = 1/n`. When tested, Hypothesis D failed because it always returns `1`, while Hypothesis A correctly calculated `1/1.5 = 0.6667`.\n\nAfter applying both constraints, only Hypothesis A remained. This result is consistent with the relativistic velocity-addition formula, which correctly describes this physical scenario.\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nA"
