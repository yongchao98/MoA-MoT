    "Here is a brief plan to solve the problem:\n*   **Hypothesize Structures:** Represent the four options (A, B, C, D) as potential chemical structures.\n*   **Identify Starting Material:** Use the provided IR and NMR spectral data as constraints to determine which of the hypotheses corresponds to the starting material, Compound X. The key features are the carboxylic acid group and the specific alkyl substituent.\n*   **Apply Reaction Constraint:** Model the chemical reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are powerful reducing agents that will reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Select Final Product:** Apply this transformation to the identified starting material (Compound X) and find the resulting structure among the initial hypotheses. This will be the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical identification problem by enumerating hypotheses\n    and pruning them with constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

It then applied constraints from the spectral data to identify the starting material, Compound X. The IR and NMR data clearly point to a carboxylic acid containing a para-substituted benzene ring and a sec-butyl group, which uniquely identifies **Option B, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, as Compound X.\n\nNext, the script modeled the specified reaction. The reagents, red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI), are known to be a powerful reducing system capable of converting a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) directly into a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nApplying this transformation to the starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, results in the formation of **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. The script then searched the original list of candidates for this structure and correctly identified it as **Option A**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the final product by following a logical, step-by-step process.\n\n1.  **Identify Starting Material (Compound X):** The script analyzed the provided spectral data. The IR peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad O-H) and 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O), along with the ¹H NMR signal at 10.5 ppm (1H), are characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The remaining NMR signals (para-disubstituted ring and a sec-butyl group) confirmed that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option B)**.\n\n2.  **Apply Reaction Constraint:** The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, a powerful reducing agent that converts a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n3.  **Determine Final Product:** When 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid reacts with red P/HI, its -COOH group is reduced to a -CH3 group. This transforms the molecule into **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\nThe script correctly filtered the candidates based on these constraints and selected the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
