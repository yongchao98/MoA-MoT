    "*   **Hypothesis Enumeration:** List all potential answers (A, B, C, D) as initial hypotheses. Each hypothesis is a physical theory.\n*   **Constraint Definition:** The core constraint is that the theory must \"never require regularization at high energies.\" This means the theory should be free from ultraviolet (UV) divergences that plague many quantum field theories.\n*   **Pruning:** Evaluate each hypothesis against the constraint. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are well-known quantum field theories that require regularization and renormalization to handle UV divergences. Classical Electrodynamics suffers from its own high-energy/short-distance divergence in the self-energy of a point charge. Superstring Theory is specifically formulated to be UV-finite, as the extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at high energies, thus avoiding the need for regularization.\n*   **Conclusion:** After pruning, only Superstring Theory remains as a candidate that does not require high-energy regularization.\n\n```python\ndef solve_physics_question():\n    # 1.

It then applies the constraint that the theory must not require regularization for high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences.\n\n-   **Quantum Chromodynamics (B)** and **Quantum Electrodynamics (C)** are pruned because they are quantum field theories that famously require regularization and renormalization to give finite predictions.\n-   **Classical Electrodynamics (D)** is pruned because it has its own high-energy problem: the infinite self-energy of a classical point charge, which is a divergence at short distances.\n-   **Superstring Theory (A)** survives because one of its primary features is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. The finite size of strings, as opposed to point particles, smooths out interactions at short distances and high energies, thus avoiding the need for regularization.\n\nThe only surviving candidate is Superstring Theory.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the correct answer by evaluating each physical theory against the constraint of requiring high-energy regularization.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The script began with the four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.\n2.  **Filtering:** It applied the constraint that the theory must be free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences.\n    *   QED and QCD were eliminated as they are well-known quantum field theories that require regularization and renormalization to handle infinities.\n    *   Classical Electrodynamics was eliminated because it contains a divergence in the self-energy of a point charge.\n    *   Superstring Theory survived because it is constructed to be UV-finite. The extended, non-point-like nature of strings resolves the short-distance singularities that cause divergences in other theories.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only remaining candidate was Superstring Theory, making it the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
