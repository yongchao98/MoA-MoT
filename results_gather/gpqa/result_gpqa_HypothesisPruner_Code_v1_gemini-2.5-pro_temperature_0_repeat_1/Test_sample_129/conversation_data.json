    "*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The candidate hypotheses are the four possible answers for the redshift (z): 3, 1.2, 1.9, and 2.4.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The key constraint is that the object must be detectable by \"optical ground-based telescopes.\" This means the observed wavelength must be shifted out of the ultraviolet range, which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. The atmospheric cutoff is typically around 3500 Angstroms. Therefore, the observed Lyman-alpha wavelength must be greater than this value.\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** We will calculate the observed wavelength for each candidate redshift using the formula `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)`. We will discard any hypothesis where `λ_observed` is less than our atmospheric cutoff of 3500 Angstroms.\n*   **Final Selection:** The question asks for the *lower limit* on the redshift. From the surviving candidates, we will select the one with the smallest redshift value.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses\n# The candidate hypotheses are the given multiple-choice options for the redshift 'z'.\nhypotheses = {\n    \"A\": 3.0,\n    \"B\": 1.2,\n    \"C\": 1.9,\n    \"D\": 2.4,\n}\nprint(\"Candidate Hypotheses (Redshift z):\")\nfor key, value in hypotheses.items():\n    print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n# Constraint 1: The emitted wavelength is the Lyman-alpha line.\nlambda_emitted = 1216  # Angstroms\n\n# Constraint 2: The light must be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope.\n# The Earth's atmosphere blocks most light below ~3500 Angstroms (UV).\n# Therefore, the observed wavelength must be >= 3500 Angstroms.\natmospheric_cutoff = 3500  # Angstroms\n\nprint(f\"Applying Constraint: Observed wavelength must be >= {atmospheric_cutoff} Angstroms\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nsurviving_candidates = {}\nfor key, z in hypotheses.items():\n    # Calculate the observed wavelength using the redshift formula\n    lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * (1 + z)\n    \n    # Check if the observed wavelength meets the constraint\n    if lambda_observed >= atmospheric_cutoff:\n        surviving_candidates[key] = z\n        print(f\"Hypothesis {key} (z={z}): Observed wavelength = {lambda_observed:.1f} A. -> SURVIVES\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Hypothesis {key} (z={z}): Observed wavelength = {lambda_observed:.1f} A. -> PRUNED\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Print surviving candidates and select the final choice\nprint(\"Surviving Candidates:\")\nif not surviving_candidates:\n    print(\"No candidates survived the constraints.\")\n    sys.exit()\n\nfor key, value in surviving_candidates.items():\n    print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\n\n# The question asks for the \"lower limit\".

    "The script successfully identified the correct answer by systematically evaluating each hypothesis against the physical constraints.\n\nThe initial hypotheses were the four possible redshift values: A) 3.0, B) 1.2, C) 1.9, and D) 2.4. The primary constraint is that for a ground-based optical telescope to detect the light, its wavelength must be shifted into the visible spectrum, as the Earth's atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light. The atmospheric cutoff for optical astronomy is approximately 3500 Angstroms.\n\nThe script calculated the observed wavelength for the Lyman-alpha line (emitted at 1216 Å) for each redshift:\n*   For z=1.2, the observed wavelength is 2675.2 Å, which is below the 3500 Å cutoff and thus pruned.\n*   For z=1.9, the observed wavelength is 3526.4 Å, which is above the cutoff and survives.\n*   For z=2.4, the observed wavelength is 4134.4 Å, which is above the cutoff and survives.\n*   For z=3.0, the observed wavelength is 4864.0 Å, which is above the cutoff and survives.\n\nThe question asks for the *lower limit* on the redshift. Among the surviving candidates (1.9, 2.4, 3.0), the lowest value is 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
