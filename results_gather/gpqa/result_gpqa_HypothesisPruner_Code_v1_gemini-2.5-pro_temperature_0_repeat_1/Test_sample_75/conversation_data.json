    "*   **Plan**\n    *   First, establish the initial set of hypotheses, which are the four multiple-choice options provided in the question.\n    *   Next, define the key constraints from the experimental setup described in the question. These include the nature of iPSCs (undifferentiated), the function of a lineage-specific promoter, the role of TUNEL staining (detecting apoptosis), and the fact that apoptosis is a normal part of embryonic development.\n    *   Then, systematically apply these constraints to prune the initial hypotheses. The script will filter out options that contradict fundamental biological principles, such as the function of a promoter or the occurrence of apoptosis in embryogenesis.\n    *   Finally, among the remaining hypotheses, the script will select the most likely \"first observation\" by distinguishing between a significant, dynamic biological event and a static, trivial property of the experimental tools, and then print the final choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_riddle():\n    # Step 1: Enumerate the initial hypotheses from the multiple-choice options.\n    hypotheses = {\n        \"A\": \"green signal colocalizes with the red signal\",\n        \"B\": \"there is no green signal\",\n        \"C\": \"cytoplasmic localization of the red signal\",\n        \"D\": \"cell line-specific red signals label different organelles\",\n    }\n    print(\"--- Initial Hypotheses ---\")\n    for key, value in hypotheses.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply constraints from the question to prune hypotheses.\n    \n    # Constraint 1: A promoter controls gene expression, not subcellular protein localization.\n    # Hypothesis D states that the signal labels different organelles based on the cell line.\n    # This misinterprets the function of a promoter.\n    print(\"\\n--- Applying Constraint 1: Promoter function ---\")\n    print(\"Constraint: A promoter controls WHEN/IF a gene is expressed, not WHERE the protein goes in the cell.\")\n    print(\"Filtering out hypotheses that violate this constraint...\")\n    survivors = hypotheses.copy()\n    if \"D\" in survivors:\n        del survivors[\"D\"]\n        print(\"Pruned D: Incorrectly links promoter to organelle localization.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSurviving hypotheses:\")\n    for key, value in survivors.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Constraint 2: Apoptosis (detected by green TUNEL stain) is a normal and expected process in embryogenesis.\n    # Hypothesis B states there is no green signal.

    "The script successfully pruned the initial hypotheses based on biological constraints.\n\n*   **Hypothesis D was eliminated** because a promoter controls gene expression, not the subcellular localization of the resulting protein.\n*   **Hypothesis B was eliminated** because apoptosis (detected by the green TUNEL stain) is a normal and expected process in embryonic development, making it highly unlikely that there would be no green signal at all.\n*   **Hypothesis C was eliminated** because the cytoplasmic localization of a fluorescent protein like mRaspberry is a known, static property of the reagent, not a dynamic experimental finding.\n*   **Hypothesis A survived** as the most plausible \"first observation.\" The co-localization of the red iPSC signal with the green apoptosis signal indicates that the injected cells are undergoing apoptosis. This is a very common and significant biological outcome in chimera experiments, as many injected cells fail to properly integrate into the host embryo and are eliminated.\n\n<<<A>>>"
