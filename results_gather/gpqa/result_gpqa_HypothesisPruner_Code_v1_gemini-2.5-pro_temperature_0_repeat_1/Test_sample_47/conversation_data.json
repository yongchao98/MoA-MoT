The script correctly identified the reaction sequence:\n    *   Cyclohexanone -> 2-bromocyclohexanone (alpha-bromination)\n    *   2-bromocyclohexanone -> cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Favorskii rearrangement, chosen over elimination due to the next reagent)\n    *   cyclopentanecarboxylic acid -> cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (acid chloride formation)\n    *   cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride -> cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (selective reduction)\n2.  The final product was identified as cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n3.  The script analyzed the symmetry of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments.\n    *   It identified the aldehyde proton as one type.\n    *   It identified the proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1) as a second type.\n    *   It identified the protons on the C2/C5 positions as two distinct types (diastereotopic).\n    *   It identified the protons on the C3/C4 positions as two distinct types (diastereotopic).\n4.  The total count was 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n5.  This count matches option D. The script correctly labeled the final choice.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and the conclusion is correct. I will now provide the summary and the final answer.\n<<<\nThe multi-step synthesis was analyzed as follows:\n1.  **Cyclohexanone to Product 1:** Alpha-bromination of cyclohexanone yields **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n2.  **Product 1 to Product 2:** Treatment of 2-bromocyclohexanone with NaOH and heat initiates a Favorskii rearrangement. This is more plausible than elimination because the subsequent reagent (thionyl chloride) reacts cleanly with the rearrangement product. The product is a ring-contracted carboxylic acid, **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n3.  **Product 2 to Product 3:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) converts the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, yielding **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n4.  **Product 3 to Product 4:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces an acid chloride to an aldehyde, stopping the reaction at that stage. The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, we analyze its structure and symmetry:\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon it's attached to, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n*   **Type 1:** The aldehyde proton (-CHO). (1H)\n*   **Type 2:** The single proton on C1. (1H)\n*   **Type 3 & 4:** The protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other by symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). This gives two distinct types of hydrogens. (4H total, in two sets of 2)\n*   **Type 5 & 6:** The protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other by symmetry. Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (4H total, in two sets of 2)\n\nCounting these types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>",
