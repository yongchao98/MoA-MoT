    "*   **Plan**\n    *   Generate hypotheses: The candidate hypotheses are the four multiple-choice options for the absorbed color (Red, Blue, Violet, Yellow).\n    *   Calculate emitted wavelength: Use the given energy of emitted light (2.3393 eV) and the formula λ = hc/E to calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.\n    *   Determine emitted and absorbed colors: Identify the color corresponding to the calculated emitted wavelength. Then, find its complementary color, which represents the absorbed light.\n    *   Filter and select: Compare the determined absorbed color with the initial hypotheses and select the matching option as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses\n# The hypotheses are the possible colors of absorbed light given in the options.\nhypotheses = {\n    \"A\": \"Red\",\n    \"B\": \"Blue\",\n    \"C\": \"Violet\",\n    \"D\": \"Yellow\"\n}\nprint(f\"Initial Hypotheses for absorbed color: {list(hypotheses.values())}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Apply constraints to prune hypotheses\n# Constraint: The absorbed color is complementary to the emitted color.\n# We must first find the color of the emitted light from its energy.\n\n# Constants\nh = 4.1357e-15  # Planck's constant in eV*s\nc = 2.998e8     # Speed of light in m/s\nE_emitted = 2.3393 # Energy of emitted light in eV\n\n# Calculation of emitted wavelength\n# Formula: lambda = hc/E\nlambda_emitted_m = (h * c) / E_emitted\nlambda_emitted_nm = lambda_emitted_m * 1e9\n\nprint(f\"Calculating properties of EMITTED light...\")\nprint(f\"Given energy of emitted light: {E_emitted} eV\")\nprint(f\"Calculated wavelength of emitted light: {lambda_emitted_nm:.2f} nm\")\n\n# Define visible spectrum ranges (in nm)\ncolor_spectrum = {\n    \"Violet\": (400, 450),\n    \"Blue\": (450, 495),\n    \"Green\": (495, 570),\n    \"Yellow\": (570, 590),\n    \"Orange\": (590, 620),\n    \"Red\": (620, 750)\n}\n\n# Determine the color of the emitted light\nemitted_color = None\nfor color, (start, end) in color_spectrum.items():\n    if start <= lambda_emitted_nm < end:\n        emitted_color = color\n        break\n\nif emitted_color:\n    print(f\"The emitted light with wavelength {lambda_emitted_nm:.2f} nm is {emitted_color}.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Calculated wavelength is outside the defined visible spectrum.\")\n    sys.exit()\n\n# Define complementary colors\ncomplementary_colors = {\n    \"Red\": \"Green\",\n    \"Orange\": \"Blue\",\n    \"Yellow\": \"Violet\",\n    \"Green\": \"Red\",\n    \"Blue\": \"Orange\",\n    \"Violet\": \"Yellow\"\n}\n\n# Determine the absorbed color\nabsorbed_color = complementary_colors.get(emitted_color)\nprint(f\"The absorbed color is complementary to the emitted color ({emitted_color}).\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the absorbed color is {absorbed_color}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n\n# Step 3: Filter hypotheses and print the surviving candidate\nsurviving_candidates = {}\nfor key, value in hypotheses.items():\n    if value == absorbed_color:\n        surviving_candidates[key] = value\n\nprint(f\"Surviving Candidates: {surviving_candidates}\")\n\n# Select the final choice\nfinal_choice_key = list(surviving_candidates.keys())[0]\nfinal_choice_value = surviving_candidates[final_choice_key]\n\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*30)\nprint(f\"FINAL CHOICE: ({final_choice_key}) {final_choice_value}\")\nprint(\"=\"*30)\n```\nThe script calculates the properties of the emitted light to determine the properties of the absorbed light.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The initial hypotheses for the absorbed color are Red, Blue, Violet, and Yellow.\n2.  **Calculation:** Using the given energy of the emitted light (2.3393 eV), the script calculates the corresponding wavelength to be approximately 530.07 nm.\n3.  **Constraint Application:**\n    *   A wavelength of 530.07 nm falls within the green region of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the emitted light is green.\n    *   The color of light a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it emits (or transmits). The complementary color of green is red.\n4.  **Filtering and Selection:** The calculated absorbed color is Red. This is compared against the initial hypotheses, and \"Red\" is the only surviving candidate. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The script successfully determined the color of light absorbed by the textile dye.\n\nFirst, it calculated the wavelength of the *emitted* light from the given energy value (2.3393 eV). The calculation yielded a wavelength of 530.02 nm. This wavelength corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe core constraint is that the color of light a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it emits. The script correctly identified that the complementary color of green is red.\n\nFinally, it filtered the initial hypotheses (Red, Blue, Violet, Yellow) based on this finding. The only surviving candidate was \"Red,\" which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
