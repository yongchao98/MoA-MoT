This left Class switching recombination (A) and Somatic hypermutation (B).\n    *   The second constraint—that the process must cause \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\"—pruned Class switching recombination, which alters the *constant* region, not the variable region.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Somatic hypermutation (B) was the only hypothesis that remained. It perfectly matches the description of a process occurring in proliferating B cells within secondary lymphoid organs (germinal centers of Peyer's patches) that introduces numerous point mutations into the variable region of immunoglobulin genes.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the correct biological process by systematically pruning hypotheses based on constraints from the question.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with the four multiple-choice options: (A) class switching recombination, (B) somatic hypermutation, (C) VDJ recombination, and (D) complement activation.\n\n2.  **Constraint Filtering:**\n    *   **Constraint 1 (Location):** The process occurs in Peyer's patches (a secondary lymphoid organ) after antigen stimulation. This constraint eliminated VDJ recombination (occurs in primary lymphoid organs before antigen encounter) and complement activation (a humoral process, not a genetic event in lymphocytes within lymphoid organs). This left hypotheses A and B.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (Genetic Outcome):** The process causes \"high variability\" specifically in the \"variable heavy chain gene.\" This is the key differentiator. Class switching recombination (A) changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's class (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA), but does not alter the variable region. Somatic hypermutation (B) is the specific process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, creating the observed high variability. This pruned hypothesis A.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only hypothesis that satisfies all conditions is **somatic hypermutation**. It occurs in proliferating B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) and is responsible for generating high variability in the variable gene region, leading to affinity maturation of antibodies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
