    "*   **Plan:**\n*   **Enumerate Hypotheses:** Represent the four candidate compounds (Cis/Trans-propenyl/butenyl acetate) with their expected properties, specifically the total number of protons and the expected coupling constant (J-value) range for the vinyl protons.\n*   **Define Constraints:** Extract key constraints from the provided 1H NMR data: the total proton count (integration) and the large J-value (16.0 Hz), which indicates a specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Filter Hypotheses:** Apply the constraints sequentially. First, filter the candidates by the total proton count. Then, filter the remaining candidates by the characteristic J-value to distinguish between cis and trans isomers.\n*   **Select Final Choice:** Identify the single hypothesis that satisfies all constraints and declare it as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the NMR puzzle by enumerating hypotheses and pruning with constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Propenyl acetate has 8 protons, while butenyl acetate has 10. This constraint eliminated both butenyl acetate options, leaving only Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (J-Coupling):** The data shows a doublet with a coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. This large value is characteristic of vinyl protons in a *trans* configuration (typically 12-18 Hz). A *cis* configuration would have a much smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz). This constraint eliminated Cis-propenyl acetate.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only compound that satisfies both the proton count and the J-coupling constant is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Based on the script's logical deduction, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate. The total proton count of 8 eliminated the butenyl acetate options, and the large J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is characteristic of a trans double bond, eliminating the cis isomer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
