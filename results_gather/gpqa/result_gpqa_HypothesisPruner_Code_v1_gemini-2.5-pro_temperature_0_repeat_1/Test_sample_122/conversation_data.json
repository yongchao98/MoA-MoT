The velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c), so relativistic effects, specifically time dilation, must be considered.\n\n1.  **Time Dilation:** The 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta's frame (the proper time, t₀) is shorter than the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame (t). The script calculates the time in the Galaxy's frame using the Lorentz factor (gamma), resulting in approximately 51.03 seconds.\n2.  **Distance Calculation:** This dilated time is then used to calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame by multiplying it by the ejecta's velocity (d = v * t).\n3.  **Result:** The calculation yields a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result to the given options, 3,060,000 km (Option D) is the closest value. The non-relativistic answer (v * t₀ = 3,000,000 km) corresponds to Option A but is incorrect because it ignores time dilation.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The script correctly applies the principles of special relativity to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify Physics:** The problem involves a high relative velocity (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c), so relativistic time dilation is necessary. The 50 seconds is the proper time (t₀) measured in the moving ejecta's reference frame.\n2.  **Time Dilation Calculation:** The time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (t) is calculated using the time dilation formula: t = t₀ / √(1 - (v/c)²). The script calculates this time to be approximately 51.03 seconds.\n3.  **Distance Calculation:** The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame (d = v * t). The script calculates this distance as 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km.\n4.  **Conclusion:** This calculated distance is closest to option D (3,060,000 km). The non-relativistic calculation (60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km) corresponds to option A but is incorrect as it ignores the effects of time dilation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
