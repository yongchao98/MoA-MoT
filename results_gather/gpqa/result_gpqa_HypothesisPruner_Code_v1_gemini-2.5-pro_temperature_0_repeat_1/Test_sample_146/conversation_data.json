    "An elegant plan to solve this problem involves enumerating the given choices as hypotheses and then using the fundamental principle of energy conservation as a constraint to prune the incorrect ones.\n\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The candidate hypotheses are the four possible velocities provided in the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n*   **Constraint Application:** The primary constraint is the conservation of energy. The total initial energy (rest energy of the proton and antiproton) must equal the total final energy (the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles).\n*   **Derivation & Filtering:** We will calculate the required Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) for the final particles based on the energy conservation equation. From this $\\gamma$, we can derive the theoretical velocity ($\\beta = v/c$).\n*   **Selection:** This theoretical velocity will be compared against the hypotheses. The hypothesis that matches the calculated value is the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_velocity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the particle annihilation problem by enumerating hypotheses\n    and pruning them with the constraint of energy conservation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.
