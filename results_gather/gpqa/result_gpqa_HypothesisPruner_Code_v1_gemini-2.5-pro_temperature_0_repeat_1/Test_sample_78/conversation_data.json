    "*   **Plan**\n    *   Analyze the product's NMR spectra to deduce its structure. The `1H` and `13C` NMR data strongly suggest a molecule containing a p-tolyl group and an α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety.\n    *   Based on the spectral data, the product is identified as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization (C11H12O -> C11H12O). Therefore, the starting material (Compound X) must contain the same core structural fragments as the product.\n    *   Evaluate the given options for Compound X. The key constraint is that the starting material must contain a p-tolyl group to form the p-tolyl-containing product. Only one option satisfies this.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound_x():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical puzzle by enumerating hypotheses and pruning them with constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses based on the provided options.\n    # We represent each candidate with its name, molecular formula, and the type of aryl group it contains.\n    hypotheses = {\n        'A': {'name': '2-methyl-3-styryloxirane', 'formula': 'C11H12O', 'aryl_group': 'phenyl'},\n        'B': {'name': '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane', 'formula': 'C11H12O', 'aryl_group': 'p-tolyl'},\n        'C': {'name': '2-styrylepoxide', 'formula': 'C10H10O', 'aryl_group': 'phenyl'},\n        'D': {'name': '2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane', 'formula': 'C11H12O', 'aryl_group': 'phenyl'}\n    }\n    print(\"--- Candidate Hypotheses for Compound X ---\")\n    for key, value in hypotheses.items():\n        print(f\"  {key}: {value['name']} (Aryl group: {value['aryl_group']}, Formula: {value['formula']})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply constraints derived from the problem description and NMR data.\n    \n    # Constraint 1: The molecular formula of Compound X is given as C11H12O.\n    # The reaction is an isomerization, so the starting material and product have the same formula.\n    print(\"\\n--- Applying Constraint 1: Molecular Formula must be C11H12O ---\")\n    surviving_candidates_1 = {}\n    for key, value in hypotheses.items():\n        if value['formula'] == 'C11H12O':\n            surviving_candidates_1[key] = value\n        else:\n            print(f\"Pruning '{key}': Incorrect formula ({value['formula']}).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSurviving candidates after Constraint 1:\")\n    for key in surviving_candidates_1:\n        print(f\"  - {key}: {hypotheses[key]['name']}\")\n\n    # Constraint 2: The product's structure must be consistent with the starting material.\n    # Analysis of product NMR:\n    # 1H NMR: A 3H singlet (δ 2.31) and two 2H doublets in the aromatic region (δ 7.08, 7.71)\n    # are characteristic of a para-substituted tolyl (p-tolyl) group.\n    # 13C NMR: A methyl carbon (δ 21.3) and aromatic signals with 2-fold symmetry (e.g., 126.9 (2C)) confirm the p-tolyl group.\n    # The signal at δ 197.7 indicates a ketone.\n    # The full structure is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    # Since the reaction is an isomerization, the starting material must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n    \n    product_aryl_group = 'p-tolyl'\n    print(f\"\\n--- Applying Constraint 2: Starting material must contain a '{product_aryl_group}' group ---\")\n    print(\"(Deduced from product NMR showing a p-tolyl group, and the reaction is an isomerization)\")\n    \n    final_candidates = {}\n    for key, value in surviving_candidates_1.items():\n        if value['aryl_group'] == product_aryl_group:\n            final_candidates[key] = value\n        else:\n            print(f\"Pruning '{key}': Contains a '{value['aryl_group']}' group, which cannot form a '{product_aryl_group}' product.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Print the surviving candidates and the final choice.\n    print(\"\\n--- Surviving Candidate(s) ---\")\n    if not final_candidates:\n        print(\"No candidates survived the filtering process.\")\n    else:\n        for key, value in final_candidates.items():\n            print(f\"  {key}: {value['name']}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Selected Final Choice ---\")\n    if len(final_candidates) == 1:\n        final_choice_key = list(final_candidates.keys())[0]\n        print(f\"The only hypothesis consistent with all data is '{final_choice_key}'.\")\n        print(f\"Compound X is: {final_candidates[final_choice_key]['name']}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"A unique choice could not be determined based on the constraints.\")\n\nidentify_compound_x()\n```\n\nThe product's NMR data clearly indicates the presence of a p-tolyl group (a methyl group on a para-substituted benzene ring) and an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The structure is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The reaction described is an isomerization, meaning the starting material (Compound X) must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and contain the same non-rearranging structural units as the product.\n\nOf the options provided, only '2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane' contains the necessary p-tolyl group. The other options contain a simple phenyl group and would lead to a phenyl-containing product, which is inconsistent with the NMR data. Therefore, by elimination, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified Compound X by systematically applying constraints derived from the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script began with the four options provided (A, B, C, D) as potential candidates for Compound X.\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Molecular Formula):** The problem states Compound X has the formula C11H12O. The script filtered the candidates, eliminating option C (2-styrylepoxide, C10H10O) because it has an incorrect formula.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Structural Features):** The NMR data of the product was analyzed. Key signals, such as the methyl singlet at δ 2.31 and the characteristic aromatic splitting pattern, definitively point to the presence of a p-tolyl group (a para-substituted methylbenzene). Since the reaction is an isomerization (the starting material and product have the same atoms), Compound X must also contain this p-tolyl group. This constraint eliminated options A and D, which both contain a simple phenyl group instead.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Only one candidate, B (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane), satisfied both constraints. It has the correct molecular formula and contains the necessary p-tolyl group to form the observed product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
