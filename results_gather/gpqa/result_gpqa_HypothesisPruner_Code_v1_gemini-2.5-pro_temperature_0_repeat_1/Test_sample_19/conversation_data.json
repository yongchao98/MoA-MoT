    "*   **Plan:**\n    *   Define the candidate hypotheses as the four options (A, B, C, D).\n    *   Define the constraints based on the physical meaning of the \"impulse approximation\". The approximation treats the interaction as occurring with a single, free nucleon, ignoring its binding to the nucleus and its interactions with other nucleons during the event.\n    *   Filter the hypotheses. The core requirements are that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), that the nucleon is treated as unbound during the interaction (4), and that the rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere (2).

This requires several key assumptions. The script evaluates the options based on these requirements.\n\n1.  **Interaction with individual nucleons (Assumption 1):** This is the foundational concept. The interaction is not with the nucleus as a whole or with multi-nucleon currents.\n2.  **Ignoring binding forces (Assumption 4):** The \"impulse\" idea is that the interaction is so rapid that the binding potential holding the nucleon is negligible *during* the interaction. The nucleon behaves as if it were momentarily free.\n3.  **Transparency of the nucleus (Assumption 2):** For the nucleon to be treated as free, the incoming probe must reach it without prior interaction, and the struck nucleon must exit without subsequent interactions (final-state interactions). This is the \"transparency\" assumption.\n4.  **Internal quark structure (Assumption 3):** This assumption deals with the internal physics of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nuclear medium. The impulse approximation can be formulated in both relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks and does not depend on the quarks being non-relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not a core component of the impulse approximation.\n\nThe script correctly identifies that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are all essential components of the impulse approximation, while assumption 3 is not. The only option that includes all three necessary assumptions (1, 2, and 4) is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully identified the assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation in nuclear physics.\n\nThe script began by enumerating the four possible options (A, B, C, D) as candidate hypotheses. It then established the physical constraints required by the impulse approximation:\n1.  The interaction must be with a single, individual nucleon (Assumption 1).\n2.  The rest of the nucleus must not interfere with the probe or the struck nucleon (Assumption 2: transparency).\n3.  The nucleon must be treated as if it were free from binding forces during the brief interaction (Assumption 4).\n\nThe script correctly identified that Assumption 3, concerning the internal quark structure of the nucleon, is a separate physical approximation and not a defining component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\nBy filtering the candidates, the script found that only option D includes all three necessary assumptions (1, 2, and 4).\n\n<<<D>>>"
