Based on chemical principles, benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens for keto-enol tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has them. This pruned the initial list to hypotheses C and D.\n\nNext, the script applied the second constraint: the compound for part B *must* show optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon (a carbon atom attached to four different groups), making it optically active. Dimethyl fumarate lacks a chiral center. This filtered the remaining candidates, leaving only the one where B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThe single surviving hypothesis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The script successfully solved the problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses Generation:** The script began by creating four candidate hypotheses, one for each multiple-choice option (A, B, C, D).\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Tautomerism):** The first constraint required identifying the compound (A) that does *not* show tautomerism. The script correctly determined that benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens for tautomerization, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. This eliminated hypotheses A and B.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Optical Isomerism):** The second constraint required identifying the compound (B) that *does* show optical isomerism. The script correctly identified that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon and is therefore optically active, whereas dimethyl fumarate is not. This eliminated hypothesis D from the remaining candidates.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only hypothesis that satisfied both constraints was C. The script correctly identified this as the final choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
