    "*   **Plan**\n    *   **Hypotheses Generation:** The candidate hypotheses are the four pairs of kinetic energy values given in options A, B, C, and D.\n    *   **Constraint Formulation:** The decay must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. For a stationary particle decaying into two products, these laws can be combined to derive exact expressions for the kinetic energies of the products based on their rest masses.\n    *   **Filtering:** Calculate the theoretical kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino using the derived formulas and the given rest masses.

The solution requires applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic context.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion, $E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi}c^2$. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and neutrino, $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$. Thus, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products must have equal and opposite momenta, such that $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$, we can solve for the energies of the products. The script calculates the total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) and then its kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$). The neutrino's energy ($E_{\\nu}$), which is purely kinetic as it's considered massless, is found using the energy conservation equation.\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($KE_{\\mu}$): **4.116 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$): **29.784 MeV**\n\nThese calculated values are then compared against the provided options. The values in option A (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) are an excellent match for the calculated results, accounting for rounding.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion.\n\nFirst, the script established the four given options (A, B, C, D) as the initial set of hypotheses.\n\nNext, it applied the physical constraints of conservation of energy and momentum. For a stationary particle decaying into two products, these laws lead to specific formulas for the energies of the products. Using the given rest masses for the pion ($m_{\\pi} = 139.6$ MeV) and the muon ($m_{\\mu} = 105.7$ MeV), and assuming a massless neutrino, the script calculated the theoretical kinetic energies.\n\nThe calculated results were:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$): **4.116 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$): **29.784 MeV**\n\nFinally, the script filtered the initial hypotheses against these calculated values. Option A, with kinetic energies of 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino, was found to be an excellent match, differing only by a small rounding amount. The script correctly identified 'A' as the sole surviving candidate and the final choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
