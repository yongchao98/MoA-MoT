The action `S = ∫d⁴x L` must be dimensionless, which in natural units (`ħ=c=1`) implies the Lagrangian density `L` has a mass dimension of 4.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of Fields**:\n    *   The kinetic term for a fermion field `ψ` is `~ \\bar{\\psi}\\partial\\psi`, so `[\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\partial] + [\\psi] = 4`. Since `[\\partial] = 1` and `[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]`, we get `2[\\psi] + 1 = 4`, which gives `[\\psi] = 3/2`.\n    *   The kinetic term for the gauge field is `~ F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`, so `2[F] = 4`, which gives `[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2`.\n    *   The `σ_{\\mu\\nu}` term is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of κ**:\n    *   The interaction term is `\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`. Its dimension must also be 4.\n    *   `[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4`\n    *   `[\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4`\n    *   `[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n    *   `[\\kappa] + 5 = 4`\n    *   `[\\kappa] = -1`\n\n3.  **Renormalizability**:\n    *   In quantum field theory, a theory is considered non-renormalizable by power-counting if it contains any coupling constant with a negative mass dimension.\n    *   Since `[\\kappa] = -1`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option B, which states that the mass dimension of κ is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The Python script successfully determined the properties of the theory described by the Lagrangian `\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\n1.  **Dimensional Analysis**: The script correctly established that for the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `\\mathcal{L}` must have a mass dimension of 4. It used the known dimensions of the fermion field `[\\psi]=3/2` and the electromagnetic field strength tensor `[F^{\\mu\\nu}]=2`. By analyzing the interaction term, it calculated the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ`:\n    `[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4`\n    `[\\kappa] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4`\n    `[\\kappa] + 5 = 4`\n    `[\\kappa] = -1`\n\n2.  **Renormalizability**: The script applied the power-counting rule for renormalizability, which states that a theory is non-renormalizable if it contains a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension. Since `[\\kappa] = -1`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The script filtered the initial hypotheses and found that only option B, which states `[\\kappa] = -1` and the theory is not renormalizable, is consistent with the analysis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
