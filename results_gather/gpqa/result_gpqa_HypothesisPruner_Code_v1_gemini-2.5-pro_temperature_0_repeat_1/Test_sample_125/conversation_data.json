    "An brief plan to solve the problem is as follows:\n*   **Hypothesize Products:** Determine the stereoisomeric products of each reaction. Reaction I involves reducing a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center, creating two diastereomers. Reaction II involves reducing a symmetric diketone, creating a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n*   **Define Constraints:** Formulate the separation rules for the two HPLC techniques. Normal-phase HPLC separates constitutional isomers and diastereomers but not enantiomers. Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Apply Constraints:** Count the number of expected peaks for each technique by applying the separation rules to the combined mixture of all product stereoisomers.\n*   **Select Answer:** Compare the calculated peak counts against the provided multiple-choice options to identify the correct hypothesis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a string buffer\nstring_buffer = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout to the string buffer\nsys.stdout = string_buffer\n\n# --- Python Block for Analysis ---\n\nprint(\"--- Analysis of Organic Reactions and Chromatography ---\")\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
