    "Here is a brief plan to solve the problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses:\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation:** Create a list of candidate hypotheses from the given options (A, B, C, D), representing the fraction of maximum power and the exponent of the wavelength dependence.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Angular Dependence):** The power radiated per unit solid angle by an oscillating dipole (the simplest model for the given charge distribution) is proportional to `sin²(θ)`. The maximum power `A` occurs at `θ = 90°` (where `sin²(90°) = 1`). The fraction of `A` at `θ = 30°` is therefore `sin²(30°)`.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Wavelength Dependence):** The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency (`ω⁴`). Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (`ω ∝ 1/λ`), the power must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n*   **Pruning and Selection:** Filter the initial hypotheses against these two physical constraints to find the single correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_radiation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the oscillating spheroid radiation problem by enumerating and pruning hypotheses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses from the options\n    # Each hypothesis is a dictionary with the option label, the fraction, and the power of lambda.\n    hypotheses = [\n        {'option': 'A', 'fraction': 3/4, 'lambda_power': -6},\n        {'option': 'B', 'fraction': 1/4, 'lambda_power': -3},\n        {'option': 'C', 'fraction': 1/2, 'lambda_power': -4},\n        {'option': 'D', 'fraction': 1/4, 'lambda_power': -4},\n    ]\n    print(\"Initial Hypotheses:\")\n    for h in hypotheses:\n        print(f\"- Option {h['option']}: Fraction = {h['fraction']}, Lambda Dependence = lambda^({h['lambda_power']})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n    surviving_candidates = []\n\n    # Constraint 1: Angular Dependence\n    # For an oscillating dipole along the z-axis, the power per unit solid angle dP/dΩ is proportional to sin²(θ).\n    # The maximum power A occurs at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1.\n    # The fraction of maximum power at a given angle θ is sin²(θ).\n    theta_degrees = 30\n    theta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n    expected_fraction = math.sin(theta_radians)**2\n    print(f\"Constraint 1 (Angular Dependence):\")\n    print(f\"Power is proportional to sin²(θ).\")\n    print(f\"Fraction of max power at {theta_degrees}° should be sin²({theta_degrees}°) = {expected_fraction:.2f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Constraint 2: Wavelength Dependence\n    # The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole (Larmor formula) is proportional to ω⁴, where ω is the angular frequency.\n    # Since ω = 2πc/λ, the power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n    expected_lambda_power = -4\n    print(f\"Constraint 2 (Wavelength Dependence):\")\n    print(f\"Power is proportional to ω⁴, and since ω ∝ 1/λ, power must be proportional to λ⁻⁴.\")\n    print(f\"The expected power of lambda is {expected_lambda_power}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Pruning the hypotheses\n    for h in hypotheses:\n        # Check if the hypothesis matches both constraints\n        # We use a small tolerance for floating point comparison of the fraction.\n        fraction_matches = math.isclose(h['fraction'], expected_fraction)\n        lambda_power_matches = (h['lambda_power'] == expected_lambda_power)\n\n        if fraction_matches and lambda_power_matches:\n            surviving_candidates.append(h)\n\n    # Step 3: Print the surviving candidates and the final choice\n    print(\"Surviving Candidates after applying all constraints:\")\n    if not surviving_candidates:\n        print(\"No candidates survived the pruning process.\")\n    else:\n        for candidate in surviving_candidates:\n            print(f\"- Option {candidate['option']}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*30)\n    print(\"Final Choice:\")\n    if len(surviving_candidates) == 1:\n        final_choice = surviving_candidates[0]\n        print(f\"The only surviving candidate is Option {final_choice['option']}.\")\n        print(f\"Fraction: {final_choice['fraction']} (matches expected {expected_fraction:.2f})\")\n        print(f\"Lambda Power: {final_choice['lambda_power']} (matches expected {expected_lambda_power})\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not determine a unique final choice.\")\n\nsolve_radiation_problem()\n```\n\nThe problem describes radiation from an oscillating spheroid, which can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence:** The power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by such a dipole is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle from the oscillation axis. The maximum power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum, i.e., `sin²(90°) = 1`. The fraction of this maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence:** The total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`). Since `ω = 2πc/λ`, the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThe script evaluates the given options against these two physical constraints. The only option that satisfies both a fraction of `1/4` and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴` is Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by enumerating the four given options and pruning them based on physical constraints.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script started with four hypotheses corresponding to options A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Constraint Application:**\n    *   **Angular Dependence:** The script correctly identified that the radiated power from an oscillating dipole is proportional to `sin²(θ)`. The maximum power `A` is at `θ=90°`. Therefore, the fraction of power at `θ=30°` is `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 0.25`. This constraint eliminated options A and C.\n    *   **Wavelength Dependence:** The script correctly identified that the radiated power is proportional to `ω⁴` (where `ω` is frequency). Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (`ω ∝ 1/λ`), the power must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This constraint eliminated options A and B.\n3.  **Final Selection:** The only hypothesis that survived both constraints was Option D, which has a fraction of `0.25` and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThe code's output confirms that Option D is the only one consistent with the principles of electromagnetic radiation from an oscillating dipole.\n\n<<<D>>>"
