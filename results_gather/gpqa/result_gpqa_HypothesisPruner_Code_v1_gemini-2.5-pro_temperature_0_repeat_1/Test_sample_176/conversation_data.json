    "*   **Hypotheses Formulation:** The possible factors for the luminosity ratio are the given options: A) ~2.32, B) ~2.25, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The key physical laws are the Stefan-Boltzmann law (L ∝ R²T⁴) and Wien's displacement law (λ_max * T = constant). The problem states R₁/R₂ = 1.5 and λ_max₁ = λ_max₂, which implies T₁ = T₂. Information about mass and radial velocity is irrelevant for this calculation.\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** We calculate the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴. Substituting the constraints, we get L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴ = 2.25.\n*   **Selection:** This calculated value of 2.25 directly matches hypothesis B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses\n# The hypotheses are the possible factors by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2.\nhypotheses = {\n    \"A\": 2.32,\n    \"B\": 2.25,\n    \"C\": 2.35,\n    \"D\": 2.23\n}\nprint(f\"Candidate Hypotheses: {hypotheses}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Apply constraints as filters\n# Constraint 1: Radius of Star_1 (R1) is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R2).\nradius_ratio = 1.5  # R1 / R2\n\n# Constraint 2: The wavelengths of peak emission (λ_max) are the same for both stars.\n# From Wien's displacement law (λ_max * T = constant), if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.\ntemperature_ratio = 1.0  # T1 / T2\n\n# Note: Information about mass and radial velocity is extraneous for calculating luminosity ratio\n# based on radius and temperature.\n\n# Calculation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black bodies:\n# Luminosity (L) = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴\n# The ratio of luminosities L1 / L2 is:\n# (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)\n# This simplifies to (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴\n\ncalculated_luminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio)**2 * (temperature_ratio)**4\n\nprint(f\"Known radius ratio (R1/R2): {radius_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"Inferred temperature ratio (T1/T2) from Wien's Law: {temperature_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated luminosity ratio (L1/L2) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴ = {calculated_luminosity_ratio}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Print surviving candidates and the final choice\nsurviving_candidates = []\nfor option, value in hypotheses.items():\n    # We check for a close match to account for potential rounding in the options.\n    if math.isclose(value, calculated_luminosity_ratio, rel_tol=1e-5):\n        surviving_candidates.append(option)\n\nprint(f\"Surviving Candidates: {surviving_candidates}\")\n\n# Select the final choice from the surviving candidates\nfinal_choice = surviving_candidates[0] if surviving_candidates else \"None\"\nprint(f\"Final Choice: {final_choice}\")\n```\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. This is the ratio L₁/L₂.\n\n1.  **Luminosity Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the surface temperature.\n2.  **Temperature Constraint:** Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength of peak emission (λ_max) is inversely proportional to the temperature (T). Since the problem states that λ_max is the same for both stars, their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n3.  **Radius Constraint:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n4.  **Calculation:** The ratio of the luminosities is L₁/L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴). This simplifies to (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴. Substituting the known values, we get (1.5)² * (1)⁴ = 2.25.\n\nThe calculated factor is 2.25, which corresponds to option B. The information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The script successfully solved the problem by applying physical laws as constraints to a set of hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypotheses:** The initial hypotheses were the four numerical options provided (A: 2.32, B: 2.25, C: 2.35, D: 2.23).\n2.  **Constraints & Filtering:**\n    *   The Stefan-Boltzmann law (L ∝ R²T⁴) provides the formula for the luminosity ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   The problem states R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   Wien's displacement law (λ_max * T = constant) was used to infer the temperature ratio. Since the peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same, the temperatures must be the same, meaning T₁/T₂ = 1.\n    *   The script calculated the luminosity ratio as (1.5)² * (1)⁴ = 2.25.\n3.  **Selection:** This calculated value of 2.25 perfectly matched the value in hypothesis B. The script correctly identified 'B' as the only surviving candidate and the final choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
