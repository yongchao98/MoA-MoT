    "An brief plan to solve the problem is as follows:\n*   **Hypotheses Generation:** The multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) will serve as the initial set of hypotheses for the value of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n*   **Constraint Formulation:** The primary constraint is derived from physics principles. We will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2) to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp). Then, we will use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, which simplifies to ΔE ≈ v * Δp for a particle moving at speed v, to calculate the theoretical minimum ΔE.\n*   **Hypothesis Pruning:** The calculated theoretical value of ΔE will be used to filter the initial hypotheses. The hypothesis that most closely matches the calculated value, particularly in its order of magnitude, will be selected.\n*   **Final Selection:** The surviving candidate that best fits the calculated result will be declared as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_uncertainty_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves for the minimum uncertainty in energy by:\n    1.

It then used the relativistic relationship `ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x` to find the minimum uncertainty in energy. The calculated value was `ΔE ≈ 1.0546e-16 J`.\n3.  **Pruning & Selection:** The script compared the calculated value of `1.0546e-16 J` to each hypothesis. Hypothesis D (`1e-16 J`) was identified as the only surviving candidate and the closest match, as its value is nearly identical to the calculated result.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The final choice selected by the script is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Based on the code output, the problem was solved by enumerating the four multiple-choice options as hypotheses. A theoretical value for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) was calculated using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (`Δp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)`) and the relativistic energy-momentum relationship (`ΔE ≈ v * Δp`).\n\nThe calculation yielded a theoretical value of `ΔE ≈ 1.0546 x 10^-16 J`.\n\nWhen this calculated value was compared against the initial hypotheses, option D (`~10^-16 J`) was identified as the closest match and the only surviving candidate. The other options were pruned as they differed by one or more orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>"
