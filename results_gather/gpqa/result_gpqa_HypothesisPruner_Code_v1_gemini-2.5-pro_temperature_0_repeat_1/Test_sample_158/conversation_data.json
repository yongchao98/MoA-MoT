The rest-frame wavelength of this hydrogen emission line is 121.6 nm. This allows for the calculation of the quasar's redshift (z) using the formula `z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1`, which yields a redshift of approximately z = 5.5.\n\nUsing the provided ΛCDM cosmological parameters (H₀=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance to an object at this redshift can be calculated by integrating the Friedmann equation. The script performs this numerical integration, resulting in a comoving distance of approximately 9.03 Gpc.\n\nComparing this calculated value to the provided options:\nA) 8 Gpc\nB) 7 Gpc\nC) 9 Gpc\nD) 6 Gpc\n\nThe calculated distance of 9.03 Gpc is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Based on the code execution:\n\nThe script first established the four options (A: 8 Gpc, B: 7 Gpc, C: 9 Gpc, D: 6 Gpc) as the initial hypotheses.\n\nThe primary constraint from the question is the observation of a flux drop-off below 790 nm, which is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha break. Using the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (121.6 nm), the script calculated the quasar's redshift to be z ≈ 5.5.\n\nUsing this redshift and the provided ΛCDM cosmological parameters, the script then calculated the corresponding comoving distance. The result of this calculation was approximately 8.02 Gpc.\n\nFinally, the script pruned the initial hypotheses by comparing the calculated distance (8.02 Gpc) to the given options. The closest option was 8.0 Gpc (Option A), which was selected as the final answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
