    "*   **Hypotheses Formulation:** The possible answers are the options provided: A) 77 years, B) The astronaut will die, C) 72 years, D) 81 years. These are the initial hypotheses for the travel time from the astronaut's perspective.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The primary constraints are the physical laws of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Key values from the problem are the spacecraft's speed (v = 0.99999987*c), the astronaut's initial age (22 years), and the alien lifespan (150 years). A crucial missing piece of information, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), must be assumed from common astronomical knowledge (approx. 160,000 light-years).\n*   **Pruning via Calculation:** We will calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) based on the given speed. Then, we'll calculate the travel time in Earth's reference frame (t_earth = distance / speed). Using the time dilation formula (t_astronaut = t_earth / gamma), we can find the time elapsed for the astronaut.\n*   **Selection:** We will check if the astronaut's age upon arrival (22 + t_astronaut) exceeds their lifespan of 150 years, which prunes hypothesis B. We will then compare our calculated travel time (t_astronaut) to the remaining numerical options (A, C, D) to find the most plausible answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_relativity_problem():\n    # Step 1: Build candidate hypotheses from the problem description\n    hypotheses = {\n        \"A\": 77,\n        \"B\": \"The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\",\n        \"C\": 72,\n        \"D\": 81\n    }\n    print(\"Initial Hypotheses:\")\n    for key, value in hypotheses.items():\n        print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply constraints from the question and physics\n    # Define constants and known values\n    v_over_c = 0.99999987  # Speed as a fraction of the speed of light\n    astronaut_initial_age = 22  # years\n    alien_lifespan = 150  # years\n    \n    # A key piece of information is the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n    # This is a known astronomical value, typically cited as ~160,000 light-years.\n    # We will use this as a constraint to test the hypotheses.\n    distance_light_years = 160000\n\n    print(\"Applying Constraints:\")\n    print(f\"Assumed distance to LMC: {distance_light_years} light-years\")\n    print(f\"Speed (v/c): {v_over_c}\")\n    print(f\"Astronaut initial age: {astronaut_initial_age} years\")\n    print(f\"Alien average lifespan: {alien_lifespan} years\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    # gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n    print(f\"Calculated Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\n\n    # Calculate travel time from Earth's perspective (t_earth)\n    # t_earth = distance / speed.

Traveling at 0.99999987*c, the journey would take just over 160,000 years from an Earth observer's perspective.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The extreme speed results in a massive time dilation effect, calculated using the Lorentz factor (gamma). For the given speed, the Lorentz factor is approximately 1961. This means time for the astronaut passes 1961 times slower than for an observer on Earth.\n3.  **Time for the Astronaut:** Dividing the Earth time (~160,000 years) by the Lorentz factor (~1961) gives the time elapsed for the astronaut: `160,000 / 1961 ≈ 81.58 years`.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The journey would take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's point of view. The astronaut, starting at age 22, would be about 103.58 years old upon arrival, which is well within the stated 150-year lifespan. This calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The Python script successfully solved the problem by applying the principles of special relativity.\n\nFirst, it established the initial hypotheses based on the multiple-choice options provided. It then applied physical constraints, most importantly the time dilation effect. Using the given speed (0.99999987*c) and a standard astronomical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (~160,000 light-years), the script calculated the following:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** Approximately 1961, quantifying the magnitude of time dilation.\n2.  **Travel Time (Earth Frame):** Approximately 160,000 years.\n3.  **Travel Time (Astronaut Frame):** By dividing the Earth-frame time by the Lorentz factor, the script calculated the time experienced by the astronaut to be ~81.58 years.\n\nThis result pruned the other hypotheses. The astronaut would arrive at an age of roughly 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years, well within their 150-year lifespan, thus eliminating option B. The calculated value of 81.58 years is closest to option D (81 years).\n\n<<<D>>>"
