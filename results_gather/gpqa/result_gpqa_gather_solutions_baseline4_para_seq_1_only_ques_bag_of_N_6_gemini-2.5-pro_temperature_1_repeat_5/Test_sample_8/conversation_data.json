Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following symmetry elements:\n*   A **principal C3 axis** of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n*   A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)** that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but the presence of C3 and σh is sufficient for our analysis. A molecule whose point group is a supergroup of C3h (e.g., D3h) also possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three oxygen atoms prefer a trigonal planar arrangement (the BO3 core).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie flat in the same plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a concerted, propeller-like fashion.\n*   **Point Group:** This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks any mirror planes, including a horizontal one (σh), because reflecting across the BO3 plane would not result in an identical molecule. Therefore, its point group is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon and hydrogen. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its \"bay\" regions. Triphenylene itself is a large, planar aromatic system.\n*   **Symmetry:** While one might expect this large fused system to be planar, there is significant steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings. This strain forces the molecule to distort from planarity, twisting into a non-planar, helical, propeller-like shape.\n*   **Point Group:** This twisted structure loses its horizontal mirror plane (σh). It retains the C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it. Its point group is **D3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry:** Unlike the larger triphenylene derivative, this molecule is small enough that it can maintain a perfectly planar structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane means the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. In fact, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, making its full point group **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n*   A) Triisopropyl borate: **C3** (lacks σh)\n*   B) Benzo[...]hexaone: **D3h** (has C3 and σh)\n*   C) Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **D3** (lacks σh)\n*   D) Quinuclidine: **C3v** (lacks σh)\n\nOnly molecule B has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n1.  **Analyze the symmetry elements of the C3h point group.**\n    *   **C3 axis:** A threefold rotational axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n    *   The C3h point group also contains an S3 improper rotation axis and an identity element (E). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient to define the C3h point group.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three maleic anhydride-like rings. The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   It has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   It has a σh plane, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It also has three σv planes (vertical mirror planes) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Boron is the central atom, bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   The B(OC)3 core is planar due to sp2 hybridization of the boron atom. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. The C-H bond of the isopropyl group (the one attached to oxygen) will lie roughly in the BO3 plane, and the two methyl groups of each isopropyl will be positioned one above and one below the plane.\n        *   Let's check for the C3h symmetry elements:\n            *   **C3 axis:** Yes, the axis passing through the boron atom perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule 120° around this axis exchanges the positions of the three -O-iPr groups.\n            *   **σh plane:** Let's consider the plane containing the B and three O atoms as a potential horizontal mirror plane. For this to be a σh plane, reflecting through it must leave the molecule unchanged. If we reflect one isopropyl group through this plane, the methyl group above the plane moves to the position of the methyl group below the plane, and vice versa. This operation leaves each isopropyl group, and thus the entire molecule, unchanged.\n        *   Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it, it belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core.\n        *   Due to its planarity and propeller-like shape, it possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, like molecule A, it also has three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a σh plane.\n        *   The combination of C3, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:** This is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the N atom and the opposing C-H bridgehead.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the -(CH2)2- bridges.\n        *   The molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through such a plane would move the nitrogen atom to the CH group's position, which is not an equivalent configuration.\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has the required C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, correctly assigning it to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal threefold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of a threefold axis of improper rotation (S3).\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** Quinuclidine (C7H13N) is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. The nitrogen atom and a CH group are at the two bridgehead positions.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylenic (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it is not C3h.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** Triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3, has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The BO3 core is likely to be trigonal planar, which would allow for a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n        *   For the molecule to have C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) must exist, which would coincide with the BO3 plane.\n        *   Let's examine an isopropoxy group, -OCH(CH3)2. For the σh plane to be a symmetry element, the group must be symmetric upon reflection through this plane. If the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies in the plane, one methyl group (-CH3) would be above the plane and the other below. Reflection would swap their positions, but a methyl group is not a mirror image of another methyl group in this configuration. The atoms within the methyl groups would not map onto each other.\n        *   Due to the steric bulk and free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule is likely to adopt a \"propeller\" conformation (point group C3) or a conformation with no symmetry at all (point group C1) to minimize steric strain. A C3h conformation is sterically unfavorable and geometrically impossible.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three dicarboxylic anhydride groups are fused, forming a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition, there are three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and bisecting the sides of the central benzene ring that are not part of the anhydride fusions.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis with three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The presence of a σh plane makes the point group **D3h**.\n        *   While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, the question asks for the molecule that *has* C3h symmetry, which implies assigning the highest point group. The point group for this molecule is D3h, not C3h.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a trianhydride derivative of triphenylene. It consists of a planar triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its outer bays. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is the molecular plane itself.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n        *   Let's check for other symmetry elements. Unlike mellitic trianhydride (D) or triphenylene itself, this molecule does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The \"propeller-like\" arrangement of the anhydride groups around the core breaks these symmetries.\n        *   The only symmetry elements are the identity (E), C3 rotation, and the horizontal mirror plane (σh) (which also implies an S3 improper rotation). This set of symmetry elements defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine: C3v\n*   Triisopropyl borate: Not C3h (likely C3 or C1)\n*   Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   Benzo[...]hexaone: D3h\n\nTherefore, the molecule that has C3h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n2.  A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\nCrucially, a molecule in the C3h point group must *not* have additional symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or D3d.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2.\n*   **Flexibility**: This molecule is conformationally flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds. We need to see if a conformation with C3h symmetry is possible.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Let's place the central boron atom at the origin and the three oxygen atoms in the xy-plane. The axis perpendicular to this plane (the z-axis) is a potential C3 axis.\n    *   For the xy-plane to be a σh mirror plane, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon and its attached hydrogen (-CH) lie within the xy-plane. The two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to that carbon would then be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this orientation, arranged 120° apart around the boron, the entire molecule would possess a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements in this specific conformation. There would be no vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   Therefore, a plausible, albeit perhaps not the lowest-energy, conformation of triisopropyl borate exists that belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It is a rigid, planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Being planar, the plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   However, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   These combined symmetry elements place the molecule in the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of mellitic trianhydride, built upon a triphenylene core. It is also a rigid, planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, a σh plane, three perpendicular C2 axes, and three vertical σv planes.\n    *   Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOf the four options, quinuclidine (C3v), mellitic trianhydride (D3h), and the triphenylene derivative (D3h) have rigid structures that do not belong to the C3h point group. Only triisopropyl borate is conformationally flexible, and a specific, high-symmetry conformation exists that perfectly fits the C3h point group requirements.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It does not contain any vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n\n1.  **Analyze Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. The two bridgeheads are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each passing through the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B-O3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule can adopt a specific conformation. In this conformation, the plane containing the boron and the three oxygen atoms acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   For this to be a σh plane, each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2] must be oriented symmetrically with respect to this plane. This is achieved if the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies within the plane, with one methyl group positioned above the plane and the other below it.\n        *   The C3 rotation maps each of the three identical isopropyl groups onto the next.\n        *   The σh reflection swaps the \"up\" and \"down\" methyl groups on each isopropyl group, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Point Group**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or any σv planes. This corresponds exactly to the **C3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Analyze Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused to three anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: Due to severe steric hindrance between the adjacent anhydride groups, the molecule is not planar. It twists into a propeller-like shape.\n        *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the general plane.\n        *   However, because of the twisting, it loses all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and any C2 axes.\n    *   **Point Group**: With only a C3 axis, the point group is **C3**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure**: This compound is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three dicarboxylic anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center and bisecting opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of C3, 3 C2, σh, and 3 σv defines the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. In point group classification, the highest possible symmetry group is used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is C3h.\n*   The triphenylene derivative is C3.\n*   The benzo derivative (mellitic trianhydride) is D3h.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose point group is precisely C3h.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Understand the C3h Point Group:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has a principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis, rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. The point group also includes an S3 improper rotation axis, but the C3 and σh elements are sufficient for identification.\n\n2.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3):**\n        *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (BO3 core). Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n        *   **Symmetry:** The BO3 core is planar and has a C3 axis perpendicular to its plane. To have C3h symmetry, the entire molecule must be symmetric with respect to a reflection through the BO3 plane (this plane would be the σh). However, each isopropyl group has a central sp3-hybridized carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen and two methyl groups. It is impossible to arrange these atoms so that they are symmetric upon reflection through the BO3 plane. Due to steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups twist out of the plane, creating a propeller-like structure. The most stable conformation of this molecule has C3 symmetry, not C3h.\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.\n        *   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing carbon-hydrogen (CH) group. The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places this molecule in the C3v point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so it is not C3h.\n\n    *   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to its adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (1-2, 3-4, 5-6).\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is completely planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). However, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and passing through the centers of the C-C bonds shared by the benzene and anhydride rings. A point group with a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane is a D3h point group. While D3h symmetry includes the C3 and σh elements, the molecule is assigned to the higher symmetry D3h point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core with three anhydride rings fused into its \"bay\" regions. Due to severe steric hindrance between the anhydride groups, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, twisted, propeller-like shape.\n        *   **Symmetry:** This twisting destroys the C2 axes and σv planes that would exist in a planar analogue, so its symmetry is lower than D3h. The propeller shape retains the C3 axis. A simple twist would result in C3 symmetry. However, chemical literature, including computational studies on this specific molecule, reports the existence of a stable, low-energy conformation that possesses C3h symmetry. While its absolute ground state may be C3, the question asks which molecule *has* this symmetry, and an accessible, well-characterized conformation is a valid interpretation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    By eliminating the other options, which unambiguously belong to C3, C3v, and D3h point groups, the most plausible answer is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. It is the only molecule among the choices for which C3h symmetry is specifically attributed in scientific literature, even if it is as a low-energy conformation rather than the ground state.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (D)**\n    *   Structure: Quinuclidine is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Symmetry analysis:\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are also three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through the center and bisecting the C-C bonds between the anhydride units.\n    *   Point Group: The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is higher than C3h.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This is a larger planar molecule based on a triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings). Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Symmetry analysis: Similar to molecule (C), this molecule has a highly symmetric, planar structure.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes in the molecular plane.\n    *   Point Group: Like molecule (C), its point group is **D3h**.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   Structure: The chemical formula is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three O atoms form a planar BO3 core.\n    *   Symmetry analysis: The overall symmetry depends on the conformation (rotation) of the three flexible isopropyl groups.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n        *   If the isopropyl groups arrange themselves so that the methine C-H bonds lie within the BO3 plane, and for each group, one methyl (CH3) is above the plane and one is below, the BO3 plane becomes a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In this specific conformation, there are no perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n        *   This conformation perfectly fits the requirements for the **C3h** point group.\n    *   Note: While the lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate is a \"propeller\" shape with C3 symmetry due to steric hindrance, the C3h conformation is a plausible, albeit higher-energy, arrangement. In the context of a multiple-choice question where the other options definitively belong to different point groups (C3v and D3h), triisopropyl borate is the only molecule that can be correctly assigned the C3h point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: Can adopt a **C3h** conformation.\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3v\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.

A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nA molecule belonging to the C3h point group will have these elements but will lack other symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv) that would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or Td.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\nThis molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   The plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It *also* has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the centers of opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   It *also* has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it possesses C3h symmetry as a subgroup, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine**\nThis is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (C7H13N).\n*   **Structure:** It has a rigid, cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylenic bridges.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\nThis is a larger planar molecule, also known as hexaoxotriphenylene (C24O9). It's based on a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups attached symmetrically.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Similar to molecule A, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It also possesses three perpendicular C2 axes in the plane and three σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** Like molecule A, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**D) Triisopropyl borate**\nThe chemical formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, or B[OCH(CH3)2]3. Molecules with freely rotating groups are often analyzed in their most stable or a specific, high-symmetry conformation.\n*   **Structure:** We need to find a plausible conformation that fits the C3h point group.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Let's construct a conformation with C3h symmetry.\n    *   Assume the central boron atom, the three oxygen atoms, the three adjacent carbon atoms (-**C**H(CH3)2), and the three hydrogens on those carbons (-C**H**(CH3)2) all lie in a single plane. This plane will be our candidate for the σh plane.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the central boron atom, perpendicular to this plane.\n    *   Now, consider the two methyl (-CH3) groups on each isopropyl arm. The carbon atom they are attached to has tetrahedral geometry. Since two of its bonds (to O and H) are in our σh plane, the other two bonds (to the two methyl groups) must be pointing out of the plane.\n    *   For the plane to be a mirror plane, one methyl group must be positioned \"above\" the plane, and the other must be positioned \"below\" the plane, as a mirror image.\n    *   If this arrangement is repeated for all three isopropyl arms, the entire molecule will be symmetric upon reflection through the plane.\n    *   This conformation possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Does it have other symmetries? It lacks perpendicular C2 axes and vertical σv planes because of the \"up/down\" arrangement of the methyl groups, which breaks that symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   A: D3h\n*   B: C3v\n*   C: D3h\n*   D: C3h\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the C3h Symmetry Point Group\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  **A C3 axis of rotation**: This is a principal axis around which the molecule can be rotated by 360°/3 = 120°, and the resulting orientation is indistinguishable from the original.\n2.  **A σh horizontal mirror plane**: This is a plane of reflection that is perpendicular (horizontal) to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting every atom in the molecule through this plane results in an indistinguishable orientation.\n\nThe presence of these two elements (C3 and σh) automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis (a 120° rotation followed by a reflection in the horizontal plane). The complete set of symmetry operations for the C3h group is {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule provided.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure**: This is the chemical name for **Mellitic trianhydride** (C₁₂O₉). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups (-CO-O-CO-) fused symmetrically to the 1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6- positions.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   **C3 axis**: Yes, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   **σh plane**: Yes, since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a σh mirror plane.\n    *   **Other elements**: This molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes puts it in the D3 dihedral group. The presence of the σh plane raises the symmetry to **D3h**. While it *contains* the C3h symmetry elements, its full point group is D3h, which is of higher symmetry.\n\n**B) Triisopropyl borate**\n\n*   **Structure**: B(O-i-Pr)₃. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar. The molecule's symmetry depends on the conformation (rotation) of the three isopropyl groups.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups will likely twist out of the B(O)₃ plane in a propeller-like fashion. This conformation would have a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom.\n    *   **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane would require the entire molecule to be planar or for each isopropyl group to be bisected by the plane in a way that reflects it onto itself. An isopropyl group does not possess this symmetry. Therefore, there is no σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate likely has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**D) Quinuclidine**\n\n*   **Structure**: 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It's a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   **C3 axis**: Yes, there is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H).\n    *   **σh plane**: No. A plane perpendicular to this C3 axis would cut through the three ethylene bridges. Reflecting across such a plane does not result in an identical molecule.\n    *   **Other elements**: The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group for quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a large, planar triphenylene core. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically into the three \"bay\" regions of the triphenylene system.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   **C3 axis**: Yes, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. A 120° rotation maps each anhydride-fused bay onto the next.\n    *   **σh plane**: Yes, the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n    *   **Other elements**: Let's check for other elements that would raise the symmetry.\n        *   *C2 axes perpendicular to C3?* No. A 180° rotation around an axis in the plane would not map the molecule onto itself due to the asymmetric shape of the fused anhydride groups.\n        *   *σv vertical planes?* No. A mirror plane containing the C3 axis would have to bisect the molecule, but the fused groups are not internally symmetric with respect to such a plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but lacks the C2 axes or σv planes that would raise it to a higher symmetry group like D3h or C3v. Therefore, its point group is exactly **C3h**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the four molecules:\n*   A) Mellitic trianhydride is D3h.\n*   B) Triisopropyl borate is likely C3.\n*   D) Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   C) The triphenylene derivative is **C3h**.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. In the context of point group determination, this means which molecule's complete set of symmetry operations corresponds to the C3h point group. Molecule C is the only one that fits this description perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\nA molecule belonging to the C3h point group must have these elements but must *not* have additional elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, flat (planar) molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to the outer rings.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane.\n    *   It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of the C3 axis, the σh plane, and the perpendicular C2 axes means its point group is **D3h**. Since D3h has more symmetry elements than C3h, this is not the correct answer, assuming the question asks for the molecule whose point group is *exactly* C3h.\n\n**B) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   It does **not** have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group**: The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**. This is incorrect.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It is a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry**: The symmetry analysis is identical to molecule A. It is a planar molecule with a C3 axis, a σh plane, three perpendicular C2 axes, and three σv planes.\n*   **Point Group**: The point group is **D3h**. Like A, this is not the best answer.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, which is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. This molecule is not rigid; the isopropyl groups can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. To assign a point group, we consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   The central part, B(O)3, is trigonal planar. We can define a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms, passing through the central boron atom.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three bulky isopropyl groups arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion, preserving the C3 axis.\n    *   A plausible low-energy conformation can be achieved where the B-O-C plane is twisted, and the methyl groups are arranged to create a horizontal mirror plane (σh). For example, a conformation where the three O atoms are in one plane, and the three methine carbons are in another parallel plane, with the methyl groups arranged symmetrically. A simpler-to-visualize C3h conformation has the B(O)3 core and the three methine carbons in the σh plane, with one methyl group of each isopropyl pointing \"up\" and the other \"down\" relative to the plane.\n    *   This conformation possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane. It does not have any perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n*   **Point Group**: A stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3h** symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMolecules A and C have D3h symmetry. Molecule B has C3v symmetry. Molecule D is the only one for which a stable conformation has the exact C3h point group. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of the options:**\n    The question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis, but lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis or any vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the presence of a three-fold improper rotation axis (S3).\n\n1.  **A) Quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. The nitrogen atom and the opposing methine (CH) group are at the bridgeheads. Three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges connect them.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes results in the **C3v** point group.\n\n2.  **B) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n    *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is likely trigonal planar. However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   Due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule can adopt various conformations. The most symmetrical conformation would likely have the three isopropoxy groups arranged like a propeller, twisted in the same direction. This conformation would possess a C3 axis perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   However, it is not possible for this molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). A plane containing the BO3 core would not symmetrically relate the two methyl groups of each isopropyl unit.\n    *   **Point Group:** The highest symmetry achievable is likely **C3**.\n\n3.  **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings [-C(=O)O(C=O)-] are fused, one to each pair of adjacent carbon atoms of the benzene ring.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflection through this plane leaves the planar molecule unchanged.\n        *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane (and the absence of other elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h) confirms its point group is **C3h**.\n\n4.  **D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger analogue of the previous molecule, based on a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. Three anhydride rings are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   Like the previous molecule, this molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   **Crucially**, it also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the centers of the bonds connecting the benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n1.  **Analyze the C3h point group:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The presence of these two symmetry elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n2.  **Analyze molecule A: triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n    *   The central B atom is bonded to three -O-iPr groups. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n    *   For a σh plane to exist, this plane would have to contain the B and three O atoms. However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar and their atoms (C and H) do not have corresponding atoms reflected through this plane. For example, the H atom on the central carbon of the isopropyl group will be on one side of the plane with no counterpart on the other. Therefore, it lacks a σh plane. Its most likely point group is C3, assuming a propeller-like conformation.\n\n3.  **Analyze molecule B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride)**\n    *   This molecule is derived from benzene by replacing all six hydrogen atoms with three dicarboxylic anhydride groups.\n    *   The central benzene ring is planar. The anhydride groups (-C(O)OC(O)-) are also planar.\n    *   The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. Rotating by 120° maps the molecule onto itself.\n    *   A C2 axis passes through the midpoint of each C-C bond of the benzene ring that is part of an anhydride group, and through the center of the opposite C-C bond. There are three such C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   A σh plane exists, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group D3h. The σh plane is also consistent with D3h.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule has D3h symmetry, not C3h.\n\n4.  **Analyze molecule C: quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4). Rotation by 120° around this axis interchanges the three ethylenic bridges (-CH2-CH2-).\n    *   Looking down the C3 axis, there are three mirror planes (σv) that each contain the N, C4, and one of the CH2-CH2 bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflecting the N atom through a plane halfway along the N-C4 bond does not land on the C4 atom.\n    *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the C3v point group.\n\n5.  **Analyze molecule D: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   This molecule has a large, rigid, polycyclic aromatic core (triphenylene) with three furanone anhydride groups fused to it.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of the core and the substituents. The triphenylene core has D3h symmetry. The three anhydride groups are attached in a symmetric, propeller-like fashion.\n    *   Let's place the molecule in a coordinate system with the z-axis passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its general plane. This z-axis is a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   Now, let's consider a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the xy-plane, located at the center of the molecule's thickness. The triphenylene core is planar and would lie in this plane. However, the furanone anhydride groups are not planar. Each anhydride group has two carbonyl oxygens. In the lowest energy conformation, to relieve steric strain, these groups are twisted out of the plane of the aromatic core. The three groups twist in the same direction, creating a propeller-like shape.\n    *   Due to this twisting, the molecule is not planar. For a σh plane to exist, for every atom at position (x, y, z), there must be an identical atom at (x, y, -z). This is not the case here. The carbonyl oxygen atoms are all pointing somewhat \"up\" or \"down\" relative to the central plane, but there is no corresponding set on the opposite side.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule lacks a σh plane. It also lacks the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and the σv planes because of the twist. The only remaining symmetry element is the C3 axis. Thus, the point group of this molecule is C3.\n\n**Re-evaluation and Correction:**\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding of one of the structures or the question implies an idealized conformation. Let's reconsider molecule B.\n\n**Molecule B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   This molecule is also known as benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride.\n*   While an idealized structure is perfectly planar and thus D3h, steric hindrance between the adjacent carbonyl oxygen atoms forces the molecule to pucker out of the plane.\n*   The molecule distorts from planarity to relieve this strain. The central benzene ring adopts a chair-like or boat-like conformation, and the anhydride groups twist.\n*   In the most stable, calculated conformation, the molecule adopts a structure that possesses a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The six carbonyl oxygen atoms form two sets of three: one set pointing \"up\" and the other set pointing \"down\" relative to the central plane. The σh plane passes through the center of the molecule, reflecting the \"up\" set of atoms onto the \"down\" set. The C3 axis remains, passing through the center perpendicular to this plane.\n*   Therefore, the actual, non-planar ground state structure of this molecule has **C3h symmetry**. This is a known, if somewhat counter-intuitive, example in point group analysis.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Molecule A: C3\n*   Molecule B: C3h (due to steric-induced puckering)\n*   Molecule C: C3v\n*   Molecule D: C3\n\nThus, the molecule with C3h symmetry is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the C3h Point Group\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (C3): The molecule looks the same after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh): The molecule is symmetric with respect to reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n3.  An improper rotation axis of order 3 (S3): This is a consequence of having both C3 and σh (S3 = rotation by 120° followed by reflection in the horizontal plane).\nImportantly, a C3h molecule does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4).\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes puts quinuclidine in the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each connected to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, the molecule adopts a propeller-like conformation to minimize repulsion. The three O-iPr groups are twisted in the same direction relative to the central BO3 plane.\n    *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the approximate plane of the three oxygen atoms.\n    *   This conformation does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the isopropyl groups are twisted out of the plane, and the arrangement of the methyl groups breaks any potential in-plane reflection symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3** point group.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). The molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to alternating sides (i.e., to the C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6 bonds).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Let's check for C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. There are three such axes. Each axis passes through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of the benzene bonds that are *not* fused to anhydride rings (i.e., C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C1). A 180° rotation around one of these axes maps the molecule onto itself. For example, rotation around the axis bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds exchanges the anhydride at C1-C2 with the one at C3-C4, and maps the anhydride at C5-C6 onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This name describes a molecule with a triphenylene core (a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings, with D3h symmetry). Three anhydride-like \"trifuran...hexaone\" groups are fused to the core. The specified fusion sites [1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c''] in the standard IUPAC numbering for triphenylene would result in an asymmetric molecule. However, in symmetry problems, such complex names often intend to describe a symmetrically substituted molecule. Let's assume the three groups are fused in a C3-symmetric fashion to the outer edges of the D3h triphenylene core (e.g., on bonds 2-3, 6-7, 10-11).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   The C3-symmetric substitution preserves the C3 axis of the triphenylene core.\n    *   Let's check for C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The original C2 axes of the triphenylene core pass through the midpoints of certain bonds. A rotation around any of these original C2 axes would map a substituted position (with an anhydride ring) to an unsubstituted position. Therefore, the original C2 axes are lost. No new C2 axes are created because of the 3-fold substitution pattern.\n    *   Similarly, any vertical mirror planes (σv) are also lost.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks perpendicular C2 axes and vertical σv planes. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Molecule A has C3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule B has C3v symmetry.\n*   Molecule C has D3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule D has C3 symmetry.\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n1.  **Analyze the C3h symmetry group:** A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n    *   A **σh mirror plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    The presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the presence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The C3h point group consists of the operations {E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^5}. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses at least a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, fused aromatic core (triphenylene) with three anhydride-like groups attached.\n        *   **Symmetry:** Due to severe steric hindrance between the fused rings, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, propeller-like shape. This twisted structure has a C3 axis passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its average plane. However, because it is twisted and chiral (like a propeller), it cannot have a mirror plane (σh). A reflection would convert the molecule into its mirror image (enantiomer).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This molecule belongs to the **C3** point group. It has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Thus, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the IUPAC name for **mellitic trianhydride** (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three five-membered anhydride rings.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The entire molecule is **planar**.\n            *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n            *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.\n        *   The molecule also possesses other symmetry elements (three C2 axes in the plane and three vertical mirror planes, σv), which places it in the **D3h** point group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule has both a C3 axis and a σh plane, it fulfills the requirements for C3h symmetry. The D3h point group is a supergroup of C3h, meaning it contains all the symmetry elements of C3h.\n\n    *   **C) triisopropyl borate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups, B(O-iPr)3.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar. To minimize steric repulsion, the three isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2] twist in a concerted, propeller-like fashion. This conformation gives the molecule a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, like any propeller, this structure is chiral and lacks a mirror plane (σh).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule belongs to the **C3** point group. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) with a cage-like structure.\n        *   **Symmetry:** It has a **C3 axis** that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It has a C3 axis, but it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   Molecule A: C3 symmetry (No σh)\n    *   Molecule B: D3h symmetry (Has C3 and σh)\n    *   Molecule C: C3 symmetry (No σh)\n    *   Molecule D: C3v symmetry (No σh)\n\nOnly molecule B possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane. Therefore, it is the only one with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of Molecular Symmetry**\n\n    To answer this question, we need to determine the point group of each molecule. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses a C3 axis (three-fold rotational symmetry) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, and no other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n\n    1.  **Quinuclidine (D):**\n        *   Structure: 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It's a cage-like molecule.\n        *   Symmetry elements: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   Point group: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places it in the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n    2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B):**\n        *   Structure: B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is isopropyl, -CH(CH3)2. The central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar geometry.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The molecule has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. The three isopropyl groups are likely arranged in a propeller-like fashion to minimize steric hindrance. In this conformation, the molecule lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the methyl groups of the isopropyl substituents are not located within the BO3 plane.\n        *   Point group: Its point group is **C3**.\n\n    3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C):**\n        *   Structure: This is a large, planar molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry) to which three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically.\n        *   Symmetry elements: Being planar, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the plane of the molecule. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. Crucially, due to the high symmetry of the triphenylene core and the symmetric placement of the anhydride groups, it also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   Point group: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places it in the **D3h** point group. While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n    4.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A):**\n        *   Structure: This molecule is mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (1-2, 3-4, 5-6). The molecule is planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n            *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   Unlike molecule C, it does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The asymmetry of the anhydride groups (the ether oxygen is on one side) breaks this potential symmetry. It also lacks vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Point group: The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, and the absence of any higher-order symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n    *   A) C3h\n    *   B) C3\n    *   C) D3h\n    *   D) C3v\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry.

The full set of symmetry operations for C3h is {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule A: quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgeheads, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the N atom and the opposing bridgehead C-H group.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule C: triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure:** B(O-i-Pr)₃. A central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar. There is a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane passing through the boron atom.\n        *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they adopt a propeller-like conformation where all three groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation preserves the C3 axis but destroys any potential mirror planes. Specifically, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the sp³-hybridized carbons and their methyl groups are not symmetric with respect to the B(O)₃ plane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of the most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate is **C3**. (Note: The related molecule, boric acid B(OH)₃, is planar and does have C3h symmetry).\n\n4.  **Analyze Molecule D: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the systematic IUPAC name for **mellitic trianhydride**.

This indicates a likely flaw in the question. However, in a multiple-choice context, we must identify the \"best\" answer.\n    Molecules with D3h symmetry (B and D) contain all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), plus additional elements (3C2, 3σv). It is a common mistake in introductory chemistry to identify the C3 axis and σh plane and assign the group as C3h, while overlooking the perpendicular C2 axes that make the group D3h. Given that both B and D are D3h, and D (mellitic trianhydride) is a more common textbook example of a high-symmetry molecule than B, it is the most plausible intended answer based on this common misconception.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n*   A **C3 axis**: A three-fold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting all atoms through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\nThe C3h point group also includes an S3 improper rotation axis, but the presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient for our identification.\n\n**2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\n*   **D) quinuclidine:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) with a cage-like structure.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen (N) atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (CH) atom. A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular (horizontal) to this C3 axis. Instead, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n*   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups. The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   **However**, it also possesses additional symmetry elements. There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C3 axis and the three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 point group family. With the addition of the σh plane, the full point group is **D3h**. While D3h symmetry includes the elements of C3h, it is a higher order symmetry group.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger, analogous molecule to (C), but with a triphenylene core instead of benzene.

Let's consider an idealized conformation that maximizes symmetry. If we imagine a plane containing the B, three O, and the three tertiary C atoms (of the isopropyl groups), this plane can act as a σh. For this to be a valid symmetry element, the two methyl groups on each isopropyl must be positioned symmetrically above and below this plane (one being the reflection of the other).\n        *   In this conformation, the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It does not have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any σv planes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This specific conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3h** point group. While its lowest-energy conformation may have lower (C3) symmetry due to steric twisting, it is the only molecule on the list whose highest plausible symmetry group is exactly C3h. In chemical point group questions, one typically looks for the molecule that *best fits* the specified group, not one that belongs to a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: **C3h** (in a symmetric conformation)\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3v\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the C3h Symmetry Point Group\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  **A principal C3 axis of rotation:** Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  **A horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This plane is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.

It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C2 axes and σv planes in addition to the C3 axis and σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it contains the elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, which are in turn bonded to isopropyl groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not rigid; the isopropyl groups can rotate. We need to consider its likely conformations.\n    *   The ground state conformation is a propeller-like shape, which is chiral and belongs to the C3 point group.\n    *   However, molecules can adopt different conformations. Let's consider a specific, idealized conformation. Imagine the B atom and the three O atoms lie in a plane. The C3 axis would be perpendicular to this plane. For a σh plane to exist, this plane must be a mirror plane.\n    *   This is possible in a specific arrangement: the B, O, the alpha-C of the isopropyl group, and its attached H all lie in the σh plane. For each isopropyl group, one of its two methyl (-CH3) groups lies above this plane, and the other lies below it.\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, rotating by 120° around the axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane maps each of the identically arranged isopropyl groups onto the next.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes, the plane containing the B, O, C, and H atoms is a mirror plane, as it reflects the \"upper\" methyl group into the \"lower\" one for each of the three substituents.\n    *   **Other elements:** This conformation lacks any perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. This conformation is known to be the transition state for the racemization of its C3 ground state, but it is a valid structure with C3h symmetry.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a larger analogue of molecule A, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar molecule with D3h symmetry. Fusing three anhydride rings symmetrically onto this core maintains the planarity and high symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Similar to molecule A, this large, planar molecule has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a σh plane (the molecular plane itself).\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes in the plane and three σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a rigid, cage-like structure (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, there is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing C-H group.\n    *   **σh plane:** No, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would cut through the three ethylene bridges, and reflection would not result in an identical structure.\n    *   **Other elements:** The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes (but no σh) means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nLet's summarize the point groups:\n*   A) D3h\n*   B) C3 (ground state), but has a C3h conformation\n*   C) D3h\n*   D) C3v\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. In the context of such questions, we look for the molecule whose full symmetry is best and most accurately described by the C3h point group.\n*   Molecules A and C have D3h symmetry, which is a higher order group.\n*   Molecule D has C3v symmetry, which is a different group.\n*   Molecule B is the only one that can adopt a conformation with *exactly* C3h symmetry (and not a higher symmetry).\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nAnswering this question requires analyzing the three-dimensional structure of each molecule to determine its symmetry elements. The C3h point group is characterized by two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A threefold axis of rotation (C3): Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh): This is a plane of reflection that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**B) quinuclidine:**\n*   **Structure:** Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry:** It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H group). Rotating around this axis interchanges the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular (horizontal) to this C3 axis. A plane slicing through the middle of the ethylene bridges would not result in a reflection, as it would need to map the nitrogen atom onto the carbon bridgehead, which is impossible.\n*   **Conclusion:** Quinuclidine has C3v symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate:**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is attached to a bulky isopropyl group.\n*   **Symmetry:** While the B(O)3 core is trigonal planar, the bulky isopropyl groups cause significant steric hindrance. To minimize this repulsion, the isopropyl groups twist out of the BO3 plane, forming a propeller-like structure. If all groups twist in the same direction, the molecule has a C3 axis but loses the horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h. (A notable related molecule, boric acid B(OH)3, *does* have C3h symmetry because it is planar and the smaller H atoms are arranged appropriately, but the bulky isopropyl groups prevent this in triisopropyl borate).\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused with three anhydride-like rings. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry:** The fusion of rings onto the triphenylene core introduces significant steric strain. Large polycyclic aromatic systems like this are often forced to distort from planarity to relieve strain. A common distortion for molecules with potential D3h symmetry is to adopt a twisted, propeller-like shape (D3 symmetry) or a bowl shape (C3v symmetry). Both of these distortions preserve the C3 axis but destroy the horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to likely non-planarity from steric hindrance, this molecule is unlikely to possess a σh plane and therefore lacks C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry:** Despite the strain from fusing three five-membered rings to a six-membered ring, X-ray crystallography has confirmed that this molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, it has a σh plane and thus has C3h symmetry elements. (Its full point group is D3h, which is a higher symmetry group that contains all the symmetry elements of C3h).\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the only molecule among the choices that possesses the required C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Understanding C3h Symmetry\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  **A C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is superimposable on itself after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120°.\n2.  **A σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule is superimposable on itself after reflection through a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis (the C3 axis).\n\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but checking for C3 and σh is sufficient.\n\n### Analyzing the Molecules\n\nLet's examine each molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (BO3). Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n*   **C3 Axis**: An axis passing through the boron atom and perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis will interchange the positions of the three -O-iPr groups. If the isopropyl groups all have the same conformation (e.g., all twisted like a propeller), this C3 symmetry is maintained.\n*   **σh Plane**: For a horizontal mirror plane to exist, it would have to be the same plane as the BO3 group. Reflection through this plane would require that for every atom at a certain distance 'z' above the plane, there is an identical atom at distance '-z' below the plane. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2, has a tetrahedral carbon atom and does not have this kind of internal mirror symmetry that could align with the BO3 plane. The lowest-energy conformation of this molecule is a propeller-like C3 structure, which is chiral and lacks any mirror planes.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**C) quinuclidine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane**\n*   **Structure**: A bicyclic amine with a highly symmetric cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen and a carbon atom at the bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **C3 Axis**: An axis passing through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4) is a C3 axis. Rotation by 120° permutes the three ethylene bridges.\n*   **σh Plane**: A horizontal plane perpendicular to this C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the three ethylene bridges. Reflecting one half of the molecule (e.g., the part with the nitrogen) across this plane does not result in the other half (the part with the bridgehead carbon). For instance, the CH2 groups closest to the nitrogen are not equivalent to the CH2 groups closest to the carbon upon reflection. The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: Quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group, not C3h.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups [-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-] fused to its sides.\n*   **Idealized Symmetry**: If the molecule were perfectly planar, it would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the ring and the plane of the molecule would be a σh plane. The idealized symmetry would be D3h.\n*   **Actual Structure**: However, this molecule is known to be sterically strained. The carbonyl groups of adjacent anhydride rings are very close to each other, causing significant repulsion. This forces the anhydride rings to pucker out of the plane of the central benzene ring. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that the molecule is non-planar and has C2 symmetry in the solid state.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the actual molecule is non-planar and lacks a C3 axis, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a large, planar triphenylene core. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges of this core at positions that are symmetrically equivalent.\n*   **Idealized Symmetry**: Triphenylene itself is a highly symmetric planar molecule with D3h symmetry. The anhydride groups are attached far from each other, separated by benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n*   **Actual Structure**: Due to the large separation between the anhydride groups, there is negligible steric strain between them. The molecule is expected to be planar, or very close to planar.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule will possess D3h symmetry. The D3h point group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h point group (specifically, a C3 axis and a σh plane). Therefore, this molecule *has* C3h symmetry.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the options:\n*   A is distorted and not C3h.\n*   B is C3, not C3h.\n*   C is C3v, not C3h.\n*   D is D3h, which is a higher symmetry group that contains C3h as a subgroup.\n\nTherefore, molecule D is the correct answer as it is the only one that possesses the required symmetry elements.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n*   **Analysis of Symmetry for Each Molecule**\n\n    1.  **C) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH₃)₂)₃)**:\n        *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar and can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. Due to steric hindrance, the most stable conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation would possess a C₃ rotational axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)₃ plane.\n        *   However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms of the isopropyl groups (which are out of the B(O)₃ plane) across this plane does not result in an identical configuration. The atoms above the plane would be mapped to empty space below the plane.\n        *   Therefore, its point group is most likely C₃, not C₃h.\n\n    2.  **B) Quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**:\n        *   Structure: A rigid bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n        *   Symmetry elements: There is a C₃ rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH).\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C₃ axis and pass through the middle of one of the three -(CH₂)₂- bridges.\n        *   The presence of a C₃ axis and three σv planes defines the C₃v point group.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, its point group is C₃v, not C₃h.\n\n    3.  **D) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**:\n        *   Structure: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings. The anhydride groups are formed from adjacent pairs of carboxylic acids (from mellitic acid, which is benzene-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexacarboxylic acid).\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   It has a C₃ rotational axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n            *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   The definition of the C₃h point group requires a C₃ axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it. This molecule fits the definition.\n            *   Let's check for higher symmetry. It does not possess any C₂ axes perpendicular to the C₃ axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The \"twist\" of the anhydride C-O-C bonds breaks these potential symmetries.\n        *   Therefore, the point group of this molecule is exactly C₃h.\n\n    4.  **A) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**:\n        *   Structure: This molecule is analogous to mellitic trianhydride but is built on a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. It is also a planar molecule.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   Like the previous molecule, it has a C₃ axis and a σh plane (the molecular plane).\n            *   However, due to the higher symmetry of the triphenylene core, it possesses additional symmetry elements. It has three C₂ axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n            *   The presence of a C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the D₃h point group.\n        *   While a molecule with D₃h symmetry does contain all the symmetry operations of the C₃h group, its full point group is D₃h. In chemistry questions of this type, one typically looks for the molecule whose point group is precisely the one asked.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n    *   A) D₃h\n    *   B) C₃v\n    *   C) C₃ (most likely)\n    *   D) C₃h\n\n    The only molecule that belongs to the C₃h point group is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group consists of the following symmetry operations: the identity element (E), a threefold rotation axis (C3), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The group also includes the operations generated by these, which are C3^2, S3 (improper rotation), and S3^5. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must possess, at a minimum, a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure Identification**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride.

It consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Due to steric hindrance, the bulky isopropyl groups will likely arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion, giving rise to a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   For the molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh), the central B(O)3 part would need to be planar, and each isopropyl group would have to be symmetrically arranged with respect to this plane. This is sterically hindered and conformationally unfavorable. The sp3 hybridization at the alpha-carbons prevents the necessary planarity.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of this molecule is predicted to be a twisted, propeller-like structure belonging to the **C3** point group. This structure has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes.\n*   **Point Group**: The ground state conformation is likely **C3**. An idealized C3h conformation would be highly strained and is considered a transition state, not the equilibrium geometry.\n*   **Conclusion**: In its stable conformation, this molecule lacks a σh plane and does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure Identification**: This is a complex polycyclic molecule based on a triphenylene core with three fused anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Severe steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings forces the molecule to adopt a non-planar, twisted, propeller-like shape.\n    *   It has a C3 axis through the center of the molecule.\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The molecule is chiral and lacks any mirror planes (σh or σv) or an inversion center.\n*   **Point Group**: The point group is **D3**.\n*   **Conclusion**: This molecule lacks a σh plane and does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nComparing the four molecules:\n*   Molecule A (D3h) has both a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n*   Molecule B (C3v) has a C3 axis but no σh plane.\n*   Molecule C (C3) has a C3 axis but no σh plane in its stable form.\n*   Molecule D (D3) has a C3 axis but no σh plane.\n\nThe question asks which molecule \"has C3h symmetry\". A molecule with D3h symmetry has all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh) plus additional elements.

Therefore, molecule A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120 degrees) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic molecule with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.

It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they will twist out of the plane, creating a propeller-like structure.\n        *   This propeller conformation retains the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflecting the methyl groups of an isopropyl group through the B(O)3 plane does not result in an equivalent configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central benzene ring to which three maleic anhydride-like rings are symmetrically fused.

Reflecting an isopropyl group through this plane does not result in an identical group.\n        *   Therefore, the point group of triisopropyl borate is **C3**.\n\n2.  **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cage-like molecule with a bridgehead nitrogen atom and a bridgehead carbon atom, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each pass through the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   A molecule with a C3 axis and three σv planes belongs to the C3v point group.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n3.  **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the chemical name for **mellitic trianhydride**. It consists of a central benzene ring with three five-membered anhydride rings fused to it, one across each pair of adjacent carbons (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The entire molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule is a mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring. Rotating the molecule by 120° leaves it unchanged.\n        *   Let's check for other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group.\n        *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. An axis passing through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond, for example, would not be a symmetry element because one side of the axis has an anhydride ring while the other does not.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv). A plane containing the C3 axis would have to cut through the anhydride rings and would not reflect one side onto the other.\n        *   Since the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, and no further symmetry elements, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n4.  **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a derivative of triphenylene, which consists of four fused benzene rings in a disc-like shape. Three anhydride rings are fused to the three outer benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, unlike mellitic trianhydride, it has additional symmetry. Because of the D3h symmetry of the parent triphenylene core, this molecule also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   A molecule with C3, σh, 3 C2 (perpendicular), and 3 σv belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A has C3 symmetry.\n*   Molecule B has D3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule C has C3v symmetry.\n*   Molecule D has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule D's point group is precisely C3h. While a molecule with D3h symmetry (Molecule B) contains all the symmetry operations of the C3h group, the question is best interpreted as asking for the molecule whose full set of symmetries is described by the C3h point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nTo determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group requires a C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (C)**:\n    *   Structure: A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   Symmetry elements: It possesses a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite CH group. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) containing the C3 axis.\n    *   Point Group: **C3v**. It lacks the horizontal mirror plane (σh) required for C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**:\n    *   Structure: B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   Symmetry: Due to the free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule typically exists in a low-symmetry conformation. Even in a high-symmetry \"propeller-like\" conformation, the non-planar nature of the isopropyl groups prevents the existence of a horizontal mirror plane. The point group is most likely C3. It lacks the σh plane.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   Structure: This is Mellitic anhydride. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   Symmetry elements:\n        *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   A C2 axis passing through the centers of opposing C-C bonds of the central benzene ring. Since there is a C3 axis, there must be three C2 axes.\n        *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n        *   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   Point Group: Since it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   Structure: This molecule is derived from triphenylene, a planar aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. Fused furan rings with carbonyl groups (anhydride groups) are added in a symmetrical fashion. The resulting molecule is also planar.\n    *   Symmetry elements:\n        *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements.

This means the molecule looks the same after a 120° rotation.\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The combination of C3 and σh also implies the existence of an improper rotation axis of order 3 (S3).\n    A key feature of the C3h group is the *absence* of vertical mirror planes (σv) and perpendicular C2 axes. The presence of these additional elements would elevate the symmetry to a higher-order group like D3h.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule:**\n\n    *   **B) Quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a rigid, cage-like molecule.

It is a large, planar, aromatic system.\n        *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n            *   The C3 axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n            *   The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   It also possesses in-plane C2 axes and vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   **Conclusion:** Due to its high symmetry, this molecule's point group is **D3h**, not C3h. Although some steric strain between adjacent carbonyl groups exists, the ideal and most stable conformation is D3h.\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is analogous to molecule D, but with a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene itself is planar with D3h symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry Elements:** The reasoning is the same as for molecule D. The molecule is planar and highly symmetric.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The point group is **D3h**, not C3h.\n\n    *   **C) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is not rigid; it has several bonds that can rotate (B-O, O-C). It can adopt multiple conformations (conformers).\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to find if a stable or plausible conformation exists that has C3h symmetry.\n            *   Let's try to construct one. Start with the C3 axis (let's call it the z-axis) passing through the boron atom. Arrange the three -O-iPr groups symmetrically around it.\n            *   Now, impose a horizontal mirror plane (σh), the xy-plane.\n            *   For the molecule to be symmetric with respect to this plane, for every atom at a height z, an identical atom must exist at -z.\n            *   This leads to a specific conformation: The boron, the three oxygen atoms, the three central carbons (Cα) of the isopropyl groups, and the three hydrogens (Hα) attached to those carbons all lie in the same plane (the σh plane). On each Cα, one methyl group points \"up\" (z > 0) and the other points \"down\" (z < 0).\n            *   This constructed conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n            *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. Does it have vertical mirror planes (σv)? A σv plane would have to contain the C3 axis and be a mirror plane for the molecule. For example, a plane containing a B-O bond. Because the B-O-C bond angle is not 180°, this plane does not contain the Cα atom, so it cannot be a mirror plane for the entire arm. Thus, this molecule lacks σv planes and perpendicular C2 axes.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that has exactly the C3 and σh symmetry elements (and the implied S3). Therefore, its point group is **C3h**. While this might not be the absolute lowest energy conformation (which is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape due to steric hindrance), it is a valid conformation that the molecule *can* have. Since the other three molecules are rigidly D3h, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer Check: Molecules A, B, and D have D3h symmetry. A D3h group contains the C3h group as a subgroup, but in these types of questions, the highest possible point group is used to classify the molecule. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule on the list for which a plausible conformation has C3h as its highest point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group contains the following symmetry operations:\n1.  E (the identity operation)\n2.  C3 and C3^2 (rotations by 120° and 240° about a principal axis)\n3.  σh (a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis)\n4.  S3 and S3^5 (improper rotations)\n\nA molecule has C3h symmetry if its complete set of symmetry operations (its point group) is C3h. A molecule belonging to a higher symmetry group (like D3h) also contains the C3 and σh symmetry elements, but it is not typically described as \"having C3h symmetry\" in this context, as its full symmetry is not captured by the C3h point group. We will analyze the point group of each molecule.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to find a stable or representative conformation of this molecule. Due to some pi-bonding character between the oxygen lone pairs and the empty p-orbital on the boron, the B(O-C)3 skeleton tends to be planar or near-planar. A highly symmetric conformation can be envisioned:\n    1.  The Boron atom and the three Oxygen atoms lie in a plane. Let's define this as the horizontal plane (σh).\n    2.  A C3 axis passes through the Boron atom, perpendicular to this plane.\n    3.  For the plane to be a mirror plane (σh), the rest of the molecule must be symmetric with respect to reflection through it. This can be achieved if the three methine carbons (-**C**H(CH3)2) and their attached hydrogens (-C**H**(CH3)2) also lie within this plane.\n    4.  The methine carbon is sp3 hybridized. If the O, C, and H atoms lie in the plane, then the two methyl groups (-CH3) attached to this carbon must be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below it.\n    5.  If all three isopropyl groups adopt this orientation, arranged symmetrically around the C3 axis, the entire molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3h) or any vertical mirror planes σv (which would make it C3v). Therefore, the point group for this specific, highly symmetric conformation of triisopropyl borate is **C3h**. While the absolute lowest energy conformation might be slightly twisted into a C3 point group, the C3h conformation is a plausible and frequently considered structure.\n\n**B) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing C-H group on the other side of the cage.\n    2.  There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through the middle of one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    3.  There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). A plane halfway between the N and the opposing C-H would not be a mirror plane.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** A C3 axis and three σv planes define the **C3v** point group.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (mellitic trianhydride)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    2.  There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n    3.  There are also three C2 axes lying within the plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The additional presence of the σh plane makes the point group **D3h**. While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is D3h, not C3h.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** A planar molecule with a triphenylene core symmetrically fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. Symmetrically fusing the three anhydride rings preserves this symmetry.\n    1.  The molecule is planar, so it has a σh plane.\n    2.  It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    3.  It has three C2 axes in the plane.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** Similar to molecule C, the point group is **D3h**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   A) triisopropyl borate: **C3h** (in a symmetric conformation)\n*   B) quinuclidine: **C3v**\n*   C) mellitic trianhydride: **D3h**\n*   D) triphenylene derivative: **D3h**\n\nOnly triisopropyl borate has a point group of C3h.

The core is a triphenylene, and three furan-dione rings are fused to it, maintaining the overall D3h symmetry of triphenylene if we consider the arrangement of the furan rings. However, the furan rings themselves break this symmetry. Let's look closer.\n        *   The molecule is likely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the central ring.\n        *   It does not appear to have C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the anhydride groups (furan-dione) are not symmetrical with respect to reflection through the plane of the central benzene ring; the oxygen atoms are not symmetrically placed. For instance, the furan oxygens are on one side of the fused bond, and the carbonyl groups are on the other.\n        *   It also lacks vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Therefore, the only symmetry element, besides identity (E), is the C3 axis.

It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis: There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite carbon atom (C4) with its hydrogen. The molecule can be rotated by 120° around this axis and remain unchanged. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Point Group: C3v. Since it lacks a σh plane, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   Structure: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to alternating sides.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis: The molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Therefore, it possesses the elements required for C3h symmetry.\n        *   However, we must identify the *highest* point group. In addition to C3 and σh, this molecule has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central ring. The presence of these perpendicular C2 axes makes the full point group D3h.\n    *   Point Group: D3h.\n\n3.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is larger than benzene but also highly symmetric.

This plane would coincide with the plane of the three oxygen atoms and the central boron atom.\n        *   For the BO3 plane to be a mirror plane, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it. This requires a specific conformation where, for each isopropyl group, the C-H bond of the central carbon lies within the mirror plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned one above and one below the plane, as reflections of each other. While this conformation might be sterically strained compared to the more likely C3 \"propeller\" conformation, it is a possible conformation that possesses a σh plane.\n        *   Does this molecule have perpendicular C2 axes like the D3h molecules? No. The bulky, asymmetric nature of the isopropyl groups prevents the existence of C2 axes lying in the BO3 plane. For example, an axis passing through the B atom and one of the O atoms is not a C2 axis because rotating the attached isopropyl group by 180° does not leave it unchanged.\n    *   Point Group: The most stable conformation is likely C3. However, an idealized conformation exists with C3h symmetry. Crucially, its highest possible point group is C3h, not D3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule B (quinuclidine) is C3v.\n*   Molecules A and D are D3h. While the D3h point group contains all the symmetry operations of its C3h subgroup, a molecule belongs to only one point group, which is the one that describes *all* its symmetries. So, molecules A and D belong to the D3h point group, not the C3h point group.\n*   Molecule C (triisopropyl borate) is the only one whose highest possible point group is C3h. Questions of this type usually refer to the full point group of the molecule, often assuming an idealized high-symmetry conformation.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n1.  **Analyze the symmetry elements required for the C3h point group.** The C3h point group requires two main symmetry elements:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120 degrees).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    The presence of these two elements automatically generates a center of inversion (i) and an S3 improper rotation axis. The key features are the three-fold rotational symmetry and the horizontal mirror plane.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) Triisopropyl borate:**\n        *   **Structure:** B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each connected to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar, suggesting a potential C3 axis perpendicular to this plane. However, the isopropyl groups are bulky and not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they will likely adopt a propeller-like conformation, twisting out of the B(O)3 plane. In such a conformation, the molecule could possess a C3 axis if all groups twist in the same direction. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) that would bisect all the isopropyl groups. The methyl groups and hydrogens of the isopropyls are not mirrored across the B(O)3 plane. Therefore, triisopropyl borate does not have C3h symmetry. Its point group is likely C3 or lower depending on the conformation.\n\n    *   **B) Quinuclidine:**\n        *   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (and its hydrogen). Rotation by 120 degrees around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges. The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have the required horizontal mirror plane (σh) for C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a planar molecule based on a central benzene ring. Three maleic anhydride-like groups are fused to the benzene ring. The molecule's chemical name can be simplified to \"benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride\".\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** As a planar molecule, its principal axis of symmetry (if any) must be perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   Looking at the structure, we can identify a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 120-degree rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n        *   Since the entire molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane confirms that the molecule belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is based on a triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings). Three maleic anhydride-like groups are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene core. The molecule is not planar due to steric hindrance between the anhydride groups, forcing it into a helical or propeller-like shape.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Due to its propeller shape, the molecule is chiral and lacks any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). It does possess a C3 axis of rotation down the center of the molecule. Since it only has a C3 axis and no other symmetry elements (besides the trivial C1), its point group is **C3**. It lacks the σh plane required for C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.** Based on the analysis, only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone possesses both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which are the defining elements of the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Analyze the C3h point group.**\n    A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis (the C3 axis).\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine** (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):\n        *   This is a cage-like bicyclic amine.\n        *   It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting the top half of the molecule (with the nitrogen) across a central plane does not produce the bottom half (with the carbon).\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine lacks a σh plane. Its actual point group is C3v. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone** (mellitic anhydride):\n        *   This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused symmetrically with three anhydride rings.\n        *   The molecule is planar.\n        *   It possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Thus, it has the elements of C3h symmetry. In fact, its full point group is D3h because it also has three C2 axes in the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv). Since D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, this molecule *has* C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**:\n        *   This is a larger analog of molecule A, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core.\n        *   Like A, this molecule is planar and highly symmetric.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a σh plane (the molecular plane).\n        *   Its full point group is also D3h. Like molecule A, it *has* C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **D) triisopropyl borate** (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):\n        *   The molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is planar.\n        *   Due to significant steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, they cannot lie flat in the same plane. They twist out of the plane in a propeller-like fashion.\n        *   This propeller structure has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   However, because of the twist, the molecule is not planar, and there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The ground state conformation belongs to the C3 point group.\n        *   Therefore, in its lowest energy state, triisopropyl borate does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the candidates.**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the ground-state structures, both molecules A and B have D3h symmetry, which includes the C3 axis and σh plane required for C3h. Molecules C and D lack the required σh plane.\n    *   A multiple-choice question should ideally have only one correct answer. The fact that both A and B are D3h molecules (and thus possess C3h symmetry elements) suggests there might be a more subtle interpretation.\n    *   Often, chemistry questions about point groups might ask for a molecule whose point group is *exactly* the one specified, not a higher-symmetry supergroup.\n    *   If the question implies \"the point group is exactly C3h\", then A and B (being D3h) would be incorrect. C (C3v) and D (C3) would also be incorrect based on their ground states. This suggests another interpretation is needed.\n    *   Let's consider an idealized or time-averaged structure for triisopropyl borate. For simpler boric acid esters like trimethyl borate (B(OCH3)3), the point group is indeed C3h. It's possible the question uses triisopropyl borate as a representative of the B(OR)3 class and expects an idealized C3h structure, where the propeller twist due to sterics is ignored. In this idealized planar model (without the additional symmetries that would raise it to D3h), triisopropyl borate would be the only molecule belonging specifically to the C3h point group. This type of simplification is common in educational contexts to test the concept. Another interpretation is that the rapid rotation of the C-O bonds at room temperature creates a time-averaged structure that has effective C3h symmetry.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Given that A and B are both highly symmetric D3h molecules and C and D have lower C3v and C3 symmetry respectively, the most likely intended answer hinges on an interpretation that distinguishes a single option. The idealization of triisopropyl borate's structure to C3h (similar to its less-hindered analog, trimethyl borate) provides a unique answer, distinguishing it from the D3h and C3v molecules. Under this common pedagogical simplification, triisopropyl borate is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group consists of the following symmetry operations:\n*   An identity element (E)\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C3)\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis\n*   The improper rotation axis S3, which results from the combination of C3 and σh.\n\nA key feature of the C3h point group is the presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, but the *absence* of vertical mirror planes (σv) and C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon (CH). Looking down this axis, one sees three equivalent ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through the middle of one of the ethylene bridges. There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. This is not C3h.\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** This complex name refers to mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (i.e., at the 1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6- positions).\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** This molecule is known to be planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane.\n        *   It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis, a σh plane, and vertical mirror planes (or perpendicular C2 axes) results in the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains the C3 and σh elements, its overall symmetry is higher than C3h.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is built from a triphenylene core, which is a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically onto the outer edges of the triphenylene system.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** Assuming the resulting molecule is planar (which is highly likely), its symmetry will be the same as the decorated core.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule is a σh plane.\n        *   It will also have C2 axes in the plane and σv planes containing the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. Each oxygen is attached to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** The molecule is not planar due to the sp3-hybridized methine carbons of the isopropyl groups. Let's consider a stable conformation.\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. This is due to the three identical -O-iPr groups arranged symmetrically around the boron.\n        *   Now let's check for a σh plane. A plausible low-energy conformation places the central BO3 unit, along with the three methine carbons (the 'C' of the -CH(CH3)2) and their attached hydrogens ('H'), all in a single plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to work, for each isopropyl group, one of its two methyl (-CH3) groups must be located above this plane, and the other must be located an equal distance below it. Reflection through the plane would swap these two methyl groups. This conformation is energetically reasonable.\n        *   Now, we must check for vertical mirror planes (σv). A σv plane must contain the C3 axis. Due to the propeller-like twist of the isopropyl groups (necessary to place the C-H bonds in the plane), no such plane exists. Reflecting across a vertical plane does not map the molecule onto itself.\n    *   **Point Group:** Since the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but lacks σv planes, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3h\n*   Molecule C: C3v\n*   Molecule D: D3h\n\nThe only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThis question asks to identify which of the four given molecules has C3h symmetry. To solve this, we need to determine the point group of each molecule by analyzing its symmetry elements.\n\nA point group is a collection of symmetry operations that leave a molecule unchanged. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. The presence of these two elements also implies the existence of a three-fold improper rotation axis (S3).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **quinuclidine (B)**: This is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged. It also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis because reflecting through such a plane would not map the nitrogen end of the molecule onto the carbon end.\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes puts quinuclidine in the **C3v** point group.\n\n2.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**: This is a complex IUPAC name for a well-known molecule, **mellitic trianhydride**.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: This molecule is completely planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In addition to the C3 axis, it has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane.\n    *   **Point Group**: A molecule with a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it does contain the C3 and σh elements, its overall symmetry is higher than C3h.\n\n3.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**: This is another large, planar molecule, a trianhydride derivative of triphenylene.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar. It possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to its plane, three C2 axes in the plane, and the molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: Its symmetry is also **D3h**.\n\n4.  **triisopropyl borate (D)**: The chemical formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: The central B(O)3 core is planar. To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups adopt a propeller-like conformation. The lowest-energy conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. For each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2], the central carbon and its attached hydrogen lie in the B(O)3 plane, while the two methyl (CH3) groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below this plane. This B(O)3 plane thus acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule does not have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis or any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group**: With a C3 axis and a σh plane (and no other higher-order elements like perpendicular C2 axes), this molecule belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3v\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3h\n\nThe only molecule whose point group is C3h is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Understand C3h Symmetry**\n    A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    The C3h point group consists of the symmetry operations: E (identity), C3 (120° rotation), C3^2 (240° rotation), σh (reflection in the horizontal plane), S3 (improper rotation of 120°), and S3^5 (improper rotation of 600°).

This conformation gives the molecule a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar and do not have a plane of symmetry that could coincide with the B(O)3 plane.

Each oxygen atom of the C=O groups above the plane is mirrored by a bridging ether oxygen below the plane, and vice-versa, when viewed from a conformation that highlights this symmetry. However, the accepted ground-state structure and the point group assignment in the literature confirm that a σh plane is present.\n            *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. Trying to perform a 180° rotation around an axis passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the benzene ring does not leave the molecule unchanged.\n        *   **Point Group:** The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, but lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two key symmetry elements:\n1.

The boron atom and the three oxygen atoms lie in a plane (the B(O)3 core is planar). This plane will be our candidate for the σh mirror plane. The C3 axis will be perpendicular to this plane, passing through the boron atom.\n        2.  For the σh plane to be a true symmetry element, the rest of the molecule must be symmetric upon reflection through this plane.\n        3.  Consider an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Let's arrange it so that its central carbon atom (Cα) and the attached hydrogen (Hα) also lie in the B(O)3 plane.\n        4.  The two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to Cα can then be placed symmetrically, with one above the plane and one below the plane.\n        5.  If all three isopropyl groups adopt this specific arrangement, rotated 120° from each other, the entire molecule will have a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements in this conformation.

Understand C3h Symmetry\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   A **C3 axis of rotation**: A three-fold rotational axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n*   A **σh mirror plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n*   The presence of both C3 and σh implies the existence of an **S3 improper rotation axis**.\n*   Crucially, a C3h molecule must *not* have other symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv), which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or C3v.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule provided.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\nThis complex IUPAC name can be interpreted in two main ways, leading to two different common molecules:\n\n1.  **Mellitic Trianhydride (aromatic core)**: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups. The chemical formula is C12O9. The entire molecule is an extended aromatic system and is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry analysis**:\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of C2 axes and σv planes in addition to C3 and σh means the full point group is **D3h**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexacarboxylic 1,2:3,4:5,6-trianhydride (saturated core)**: This molecule has a central cyclohexane ring in a chair conformation, with three anhydride rings fused to it. The chemical formula is C12H6O6.\n    *   **Symmetry analysis**:\n        *   The chair conformation has a C3 axis passing through the center of the ring.\n        *   However, due to the puckered nature of the ring and the arrangement of the anhydride groups, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The point group of this molecule is **C3**.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n\nThis molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar.\n\n*   **Symmetry analysis**:\n    *   Due to steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, the groups twist out of the BO3 plane, forming a \"propeller\" shape.\n    *   This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   However, this twisting breaks the horizontal mirror plane symmetry (σh).\n*   **Conclusion**: The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3** symmetry. An idealized planar structure would have D3h symmetry, and the C3h structure represents a transition state between propeller conformations, not the ground state.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\nThis is a large, disc-like molecule based on a triphenylene core.\n\n*   **Symmetry analysis**:\n    *   Similar to triisopropyl borate, steric repulsion between the anhydride groups forces the molecule to adopt a non-planar, propeller-like shape.\n    *   This conformation possesses a C3 axis.\n    *   It lacks a σh plane. A hypothetical, perfectly planar version would have D3h symmetry, but this is not the ground state structure.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group of this molecule's stable conformation is **C3**.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\nThis is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n\n*   **Symmetry analysis**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H group).\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n### 3. Final Determination\n\nLet's summarize the point groups of the stable forms of the molecules:\n*   A) D3h (if mellitic trianhydride) or C3 (if saturated version)\n*   B) C3\n*   C) C3\n*   D) C3v\n\nNone of the molecules has a stable structure with *exactly* C3h symmetry. However, in chemistry questions, \"has X symmetry\" can sometimes mean that the molecule's full symmetry point group is a supergroup of X (i.e., it contains all the symmetry operations of X).\n\nLet's review the point groups again:\n*   **C3h**: Contains {C3, σh}\n*   **D3h**: Contains {C3, σh, 3C2, 3σv} -> Contains C3h\n*   **C3**: Contains {C3} -> Does not contain σh\n*   **C3v**: Contains {C3, 3σv} -> Does not contain σh\n\nOnly the D3h point group contains all the symmetry elements of C3h. The most plausible candidate for a D3h molecule among the choices is molecule A, interpreted as the well-known planar molecule **mellitic trianhydride**. Its stable ground state is indeed D3h. The other options have stable conformations with C3 or C3v symmetry, neither of which includes the σh plane required for C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, assuming the question allows for a supergroup and that molecule A refers to mellitic trianhydride, it is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n1.  **Analyze the request:** The user wants to identify which of the four given molecules possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Define C3h symmetry:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n    *   A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis), meaning a 120° rotation about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of C3 and σh automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n        *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Symmetry:** While a C3 axis can be imagined passing through the boron atom and perpendicular to the B-O plane, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) introduce complexity. Due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule likely exists in a low-symmetry conformation at room temperature. Even in a highly symmetric, propeller-like conformation, it would have C3 symmetry, but not a horizontal mirror plane (σh) due to the positions of the methyl groups above and below any potential plane. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a large, complex, planar aromatic system. Triphenylene is a D3h molecule. Fusing three furan-dione rings (maleic anhydride derivatives) to the outer rings of triphenylene in a symmetrical fashion maintains a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry:**\n            *   **C3 axis:** The molecule has a clear three-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passing through its center. A 120° rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n            *   **σh plane:** The entire molecule is planar. Therefore, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, its point group is C3h.\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   **Symmetry:**\n            *   **C3 axis:** There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H).\n            *   **Mirror Planes:** There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene bridges (-CH2-CH2-).\n            *   **σh plane:** There is no horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n            *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places quinuclidine in the C3v point group.\n\n    *   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is an anhydride of mellitic acid, also known as mellitic anhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three furan-dione rings.\n        *   **Symmetry:**\n            *   **C3 axis:** A C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n            *   **σh plane:** The molecule is planar, so the molecular plane acts as a σh plane.\n            *   **Conclusion:** Similar to molecule B, this molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane. Its point group is C3h.\n\n4.  **Review the options:** Both molecule B and molecule D have C3h symmetry. Let's re-read the question. It asks \"which of the following molecules has c3h symmetry?\", implying there might be only one correct choice among the options provided. It's possible there's an error in the question design, as two molecules fit the description. However, typically in multiple-choice questions, we select the answer provided. Since both B and D are valid answers and both are listed, there might be an issue with the question itself. But if forced to choose from the given options, both B and D are chemically correct examples of C3h symmetry. Let's assume the question is valid and select one of the correct options. Both B and D are correct.\n\nLet's assume there is only one correct answer expected from the list. Let's just output B as it is a valid answer.\nIf this were a test, I would flag the question. But for this task, I will provide one of the correct answers.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A - Triisopropyl borate: No C3h.\n*   B - triphenyleno[...]hexaone: Yes, C3h.\n*   C - Quinuclidine: No, C3v.\n*   D - benzo[...]hexaone: Yes, C3h.\n\nBoth B and D are correct. Let's present B as the answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group. The C3h point group requires a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It must not have higher symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv) that would place it in a group like D3h or D3d.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (B)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead. These are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the carbon of the opposing CH group. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and bisect one of the ethylene bridges. The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This complex name corresponds to **mellitic trianhydride**. The molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is planar. There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In addition, there are three C2 axes that lie within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of the C-C bonds of the central benzene ring. The combination of a C3 axis, a perpendicular σh, and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of molecule D, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. It is also a planar molecule with three anhydride groups fused in a symmetrical fashion.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Similar to molecule D, this molecule is planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to its plane. The molecular plane is a σh plane. It also possesses three C2 axes within the plane. Therefore, this molecule also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical formula is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. The boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, which are in turn bonded to isopropyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Let's consider an idealized conformation to analyze the symmetry. The BO3 core is trigonal planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. For the molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh), this plane must contain the B and O atoms. Furthermore, each isopropyl group must be bisected by this plane. This is possible if, for each group, the central carbon atom and its attached hydrogen atom lie within the plane, while the two methyl (-CH3) groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. If all three isopropyl groups adopt this specific, symmetric orientation, the molecule as a whole will have a σh plane. This conformation possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any σv planes containing the C3 axis. Thus, this idealized conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3v\n*   Molecule C: C3h (in an idealized conformation)\n*   Molecule D: D3h\n\nMolecules A and D belong to the higher symmetry group D3h. Molecule B belongs to the C3v group. Molecule C is the only one that can be represented by a plausible structure belonging specifically to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry among the given options. Let's analyze the point group of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (C3 axis): The molecule is unchanged after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh): A mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\nThe presence of these two elements automatically implies the presence of a third element, an improper rotation axis S3. A molecule belonging to the C3h point group should not possess any higher symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\nThis is a complex IUPAC name for a well-known molecule, **mellitic trianhydride** (C12O9).\n*   **Structure**: It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Additionally, there are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of the C3 axis, the perpendicular C2 axes, and the σh plane makes the point group **D3h**. Since D3h is a higher symmetry group than C3h, this is not the best answer. While it possesses the elements of C3h, its full symmetry is D3h.\n\n**B) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The point group is **C3v**.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a triphenylene core with three anhydride-like rings fused to its outer \"bay\" regions.\n*   **Symmetry**: The triphenylene core itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, fusing the three large anhydride groups at these positions introduces severe steric hindrance. To relieve this strain, the molecule cannot be planar. It twists into a propeller-like (helicoidal) shape.\n    *   This twisting preserves the C3 rotational axis perpendicular to the average plane of the molecule.\n    *   However, the twisting destroys all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and the in-plane C2 axes.\n*   **Point Group**: The resulting point group is **C3**.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group -CH(CH3)2. It consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n*   **Symmetry**: The analysis is analogous to that of boric acid, B(OH)3, which is the classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n    *   Let's assume the B atom and the three O atoms lie in a single plane. This plane can act as the horizontal mirror plane (σh). A C3 axis would be perpendicular to this plane, passing through the B atom. This B(O)3 core has D3h symmetry.\n    *   Now, we consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2]. Due to the presence of the bulky methyl groups, they will adopt a specific orientation. A plausible, low-energy conformation is one where the three isopropyl groups are arranged in a propeller-like fashion.\n    *   For example, if the C-H bond of each isopropyl group is oriented in a way that is canted relative to the B-O bond, and this arrangement is repeated for all three groups by the C3 rotation, the D3h symmetry of the core is broken.\n    *   Specifically, this canted arrangement destroys the C2 axes and the σv planes.\n    *   However, it is possible to have a conformation that retains both the C3 axis and the σh plane. Imagine the B, O, and the methine C atoms all lying in the σh plane. At each methine C, one H atom is also in the plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. This structure maintains the σh plane (which reflects one CH3 into the other) and the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: This conformation has **C3h** symmetry. It lacks the C2 axes and σv planes, so its point group is not D3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Molecule A has D3h symmetry.\n- Molecule B has C3v symmetry.\n- Molecule C has C3 symmetry.\n- Molecule D can adopt a stable conformation that has C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis question asks to identify which of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two essential symmetry elements:\n1.

A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nA molecule with C3h symmetry must not have higher symmetry, such as three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3 or D3h) or vertical mirror planes (which would make it C3v).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH group). The molecule can be rotated by 120° about this axis and remain unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**. This is not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, planar aromatic molecule.

The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group at least D3.\n*   **Point Group**: Combining the D3 elements with the horizontal mirror plane (σh) results in the **D3h** point group. This is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the common chemical mellitic trianhydride. It is a planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: Similar to option B, this molecule is planar and highly symmetric.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It has three C2 axes in the molecular plane that pass through the center of the molecule and bisect the bonds connecting the anhydride groups.\n*   **Point Group**: For the same reasons as molecule B, the point group is **D3h**. This is not C3h.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The molecule is flexible due to the rotation around B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. We need to consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups. While the lowest energy conformation is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a higher-symmetry conformation.\n    *   Consider a conformation where the B and the three O atoms lie in a plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to be true, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to this plane.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon (C_a) and the hydrogen attached to it (C_a-H) also lie in the B-O plane, with the two methyl groups (-CH3) positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   In this specific conformation, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The plane containing the B, O, C_a, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Crucially, this conformation does *not* have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane, with no other symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformer, it is a possible conformation, and this molecule is the only one among the options whose point group can be exactly C3h. The other molecules have rigid structures with point groups C3v or D3h.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand the C3h Point Group**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   **E**: The identity element (doing nothing).\n*   **C3**: A principal axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n*   **σh**: A horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   The presence of C3 and σh automatically implies the presence of an **S3** improper rotation axis (rotation by 120 degrees followed by reflection in the σh plane).\n\nCrucially, a molecule in the C3h group must *not* have perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv), as these would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) Quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n*   **Structure**: A bicyclic cage-like amine. It consists of a cyclohexane skeleton with a nitrogen atom bridging the carbons at positions 1 and 4.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite CH group.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis because the \"top\" of the molecule (the N atom) is different from the \"bottom\" (the CH group). The molecule is not planar at its equator.\n    *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group is **C3v**.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, complex, planar molecule. It's based on a triphenylene core (which has D3h symmetry), with three identical furan-dione (anhydride-like) groups fused to it in a C3-symmetric manner.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Being a large, conjugated system, it is planar. The plane of the molecule is a **σh** plane.\n    *   It has a **C3** axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center.\n    *   Due to the high symmetry of the triphenylene core and the symmetric placement of the fused rings, it also has three **C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to alternate pairs of C-C bonds (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   This is a planar molecule, so it possesses a **σh** plane.\n    *   It has a **C3** axis through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   A careful check reveals it also possesses three **C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis. These C2 axes pass through the midpoints of the C-C bonds of the benzene ring that are *not* part of the anhydride fusions (i.e., the C2-C3, C4-C5, and C6-C1 bonds). Rotating by 180 degrees around one of these axes maps the molecule onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion**: Like molecule B, this molecule's point group is **D3h**.\n\n**Note on D3h vs. C3h**: A question asking \"which molecule has C3h symmetry?\" is best interpreted as \"which molecule's point group *is* C3h?\". Molecules with D3h symmetry contain the symmetry elements of C3h, but their full symmetry is described by the D3h group, not the C3h subgroup. Since two options (B and D) are D3h, and one (A) is C3v, the answer must be C.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2). The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: This case requires considering different possible conformations. A common analogy is made with boric acid, B(OH)3.\n    *   Boric acid, B(OH)3, is planar and has a C3 axis. While a high-symmetry D3h conformation exists, the commonly cited point group is **C3h**. This is because a lower-energy conformation involves a slight propeller-like twist of the O-H bonds within the molecular plane. This twist preserves the C3 axis and the σh plane (the plane of the molecule) but destroys the perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   We can apply the same reasoning to triisopropyl borate. We consider a conformation where the bulky isopropyl groups are treated as discs. The molecule can be arranged with a planar B-O3 core, providing a **σh** plane and a **C3** axis.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will adopt a propeller-like arrangement. This \"twist\" breaks the C2 symmetry that would pass through the B-O bonds.\n    *   Therefore, this conformation lacks perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes but retains the C3 axis and the σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation belonging to the **C3h** point group. It is the only molecule among the choices whose point group is C3h.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\n*   A) quinuclidine: C3v\n*   B) triphenylene derivative: D3h\n*   C) triisopropyl borate: **C3h**\n*   D) benzene derivative: D3h\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nThe C3h point group describes a specific set of symmetry elements that a molecule possesses. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n*   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n*   A **σh mirror plane**: This is a horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n*   It must **not** have other symmetry elements, such as vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like C3v or D3h).\n\nThe operations in the C3h group are E (identity), C3 (120° rotation), C3² (240° rotation), σh (horizontal reflection), S3 (120° rotation then reflection), and S3⁵ (240° rotation then reflection).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, planar molecule. The core is triphenylene (D3h symmetry), to which three anhydride-like rings are fused symmetrically on the outer edges.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane passing through the center. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Due to its high symmetry, it also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. The presence of these C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. Boron is typically trigonal planar (sp2 hybridized). To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule adopts a specific low-energy conformation.\n*   **Conformation for C3h symmetry:** Let's consider a conformation where the B atom, the three O atoms, the three adjacent C atoms, and their attached H atoms (from the -CH moiety) all lie in a single plane. For each isopropyl group, the two methyl (-CH3) groups are arranged symmetrically, one above this plane and one below.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to this plane, passing through the central Boron atom. A 120° rotation maps each isopropoxy group onto the next one.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane containing the B, O, C, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane. Reflecting through this plane swaps the \"top\" methyl group with the \"bottom\" methyl group for each of the three isopropyl substituents, leaving the overall molecule unchanged.\n*   **Other elements?** No. There are no vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. For instance, a 180° rotation around an axis passing through one of the B-O bonds would not map the other two isopropyl groups onto each other.\n*   Therefore, this molecule, in its stable conformation, belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**C) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a C-H group at the other.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. The axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n*   **σh plane?** No. A horizontal plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the C-C bonds connecting the two ends. Reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the position of the carbon atom, which are different. Thus, there is no σh.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes (and the absence of σh) means quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as Mellitic Anhydride. It's a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. Perpendicular to the molecular plane through the center of the benzene ring.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Like molecule A, it has three C2 axes in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has a stable conformation that belongs to the C3h point group. The other molecules belong to either D3h or C3v point groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe user wants me to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry from the given list.

Due to steric hindrance, they will likely adopt a propeller-like conformation. In this conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis.\n    *   However, for C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis is required. Such a plane would have to contain the Boron and the three Oxygen atoms. The isopropyl groups, with their out-of-plane methyl groups and hydrogens, would need to be reflected through this plane. This is not possible; the molecule lacks a σh plane. The most likely point group due to the propeller arrangement is C3.\n\n2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with the nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n    *   There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis results in an indistinguishable conformation.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three -(CH2)2- bridges.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It does not have C3h symmetry as it lacks the required horizontal mirror plane.\n\n3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride.\n    *   The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   It has a central C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   It also has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   Any planar molecule with a Cn axis (n>1) perpendicular to the plane must have a σh plane and thus belongs to the Cnh point group.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule possesses **C3h** symmetry.

It is structurally related to the mellitic trianhydride but based on a larger, non-planar triphenylene core.\n    *   Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, the fusion of the anhydride groups puckers the structure. The outer benzene rings are twisted out of the plane of the central ring, creating a propeller-like, helical shape.\n    *   This helical structure possesses a C3 axis of rotation through the center of the molecule.\n    *   However, because of the twisting, it lacks any mirror planes (neither σh nor σv). It also lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   A molecule with only a Cn axis belongs to the Cn point group.

The B and the three O atoms form a trigonal planar B(O)3 core.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.

Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n    *   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Molecule:**\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n        *   This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure, also known as 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.\n        *   Imagine the axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon (a CH group). Looking down this axis, the molecule's three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges are arranged symmetrically. A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged, so it has a **C3 axis**.\n        *   However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to cut through the middle of the three ethylene bridges. The part of the molecule near the nitrogen is not a mirror image of the part near the bridgehead carbon.\n        *   Quinuclidine has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3):**\n        *   The molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-OCH(CH3)2). The BO3 core is trigonal planar.\n        *   This molecule is flexible due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n        *   In the gas phase, it can adopt a low-energy conformation with a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the BO3 plane, creating a propeller-like structure.\n        *   For a **σh plane** to exist, the molecule must have mirror symmetry across the plane containing the B and O atoms. This is possible if for each isopropyl group, the Cα-H bond lies in the plane, and the two methyl groups are arranged symmetrically above and below the plane. Studies have shown that triisopropyl borate does adopt a **C3h** conformation. However, this symmetry applies to a specific conformer and not a rigid skeleton.\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   This is a large, planar molecule.

A molecule with D3h symmetry contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3h is a subgroup of D3h).

A 120° rotation maps the three anhydride rings onto each other.\n        *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. Unlike molecule A, there are no C2 axes lying in the molecular plane. For instance, rotating by 180° around an axis passing through the C2-C3 bond does not leave the molecule invariant because it would map the anhydride ring at the C5-C6 position onto the C2-C3 bond, where there is no anhydride. Similarly, there are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   The only symmetry elements are those of the C3h group (E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^5). Therefore, the point group of this molecule is exactly **C3h**.

A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n    *   The three isopropoxy groups can be arranged in a propeller-like fashion. Due to steric hindrance, they twist out of the BO3 plane.\n    *   For a σh plane to exist, the plane containing the B and O atoms must be a mirror plane. However, reflecting an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2) through this plane does not result in an identical structure because the two methyl groups and the hydrogen on the methine carbon are not symmetrically arranged with respect to this plane. Therefore, triisopropyl borate lacks a σh plane and its point group is C3, not C3h.\n\n2.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   This is a large, disc-shaped molecule based on a triphenylene core.\n    *   Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry.\n    *   The attached furan-dione groups (-C4O3-) are fused to the benzene rings.\n    *   Looking at the structure, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the center of the molecule.\n    *   Each of the three lobes of the molecule is a mirror image of the other, but they are arranged in a propeller-like fashion. The molecule as a whole lacks vertical mirror planes (σv) or dihedral planes (σd) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   If the molecule were perfectly planar, it would possess a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule itself. In this case, the symmetry would be D3h.\n    *   However, due to steric hindrance between the oxygen atoms of adjacent furan-dione groups, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, helical conformation. This twisting eliminates the σh plane and the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The resulting point group is D3, which includes a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes, but no mirror planes.\n\n3.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine, with a cage-like structure. It can be viewed as three ethylene bridges (-CH2-CH2-) connecting a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgeheads.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (the C-H group). Rotation by 120° or 240° maps the molecule onto itself.\n    *   However, quinuclidine does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to pass through the midpoints of the three ethylene bridges, but this operation does not leave the molecule invariant.\n    *   It does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is C3v.\n\n4.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is an oxide of benzene, C12O6.

The C3 rotational axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.

The presence of these two elements also implies an S3 improper rotation axis. It does not possess C2 axes perpendicular to C3, nor vertical mirror planes (σv), so the point group is not D3h or C3v.\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nA molecule belongs to the **C3h point group** if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 principal axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 120 degrees around this axis.\n2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule is indistinguishable after reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis.\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis as well.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3**\n*   The central part of the molecule consists of a boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms (BO3). This core is trigonal planar, and a C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n*   However, each oxygen is attached to a bulky isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]. Due to steric hindrance (crowding) between these bulky groups, they will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is achieved by twisting out of the BO3 plane in a \"propeller-like\" fashion.\n*   This propeller conformation preserves the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, the most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3 symmetry**, not C3h. While a C3h conformation is theoretically possible, it would be very high in energy and is not the molecule's representative structure.\n\n**B) quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   This is a rigid, cage-like molecule.\n*   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen (N) atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n*   However, the molecule does not have a mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting through such a plane would require swapping the N atom with the CH group, which is not a symmetry operation as they are different.\n*   Instead, quinuclidine has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   A molecule with one C3 axis and three σv planes belongs to the **C3v point group**. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   This is the chemical name for **mellitic trianhydride (C12O9)**. The structure consists of a central benzene ring with three five-membered anhydride rings fused to its alternating sides (i.e., fused to the C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6 bonds).\n*   The molecule is a large, conjugated system, which strongly favors a planar geometry.\n*   There is a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. Rotating by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a mirror plane. This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, so it is a **σh plane**.\n*   The molecule has both a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks other symmetry elements (like C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or vertical mirror planes) that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **C3h point group**.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   This molecule is analogous to C, but it's built on a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings.\n*   The three anhydride rings are fused to the outer \"bay regions\" of the triphenylene system.\n*   Like molecule C, if this molecule were planar, it would have C3h symmetry for the same reasons (a C3 axis and a σh plane).\n*   However, fusing groups onto the bay regions of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons creates significant steric strain (in this case, between the anhydride groups and hydrogen atoms on adjacent rings). This strain is well-known to force the molecule to twist out of planarity, adopting a helical or propeller shape to relieve the crowding.\n*   This twisting would destroy the σh mirror plane. The molecule would likely retain its C3 axis, resulting in the **C3 point group**, similar to triisopropyl borate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, molecule C (mellitic trianhydride) is the only one among the choices that is expected to have a stable structure belonging to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis). This means the molecule is unchanged after a 120° rotation around this axis.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n*   Structure: Quinuclidine has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions, linked by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) chains.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (and the hydrogen attached to it).\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   Point Group: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes results in the **C3v** point group.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   Structure: This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core. The overall structure is highly symmetric.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   Point Group: A C3 axis, a perpendicular σh, and three C2 axes perpendicular to C3 are characteristic of the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule does possess the elements of C3h symmetry (C3 and σh), D3h is a higher order, more complete description of its symmetry.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (also known as hexahydroxybenzene triscarbonate, C9O9)**\n*   Structure: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three carbonate ester rings. It is planar.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   Similar to option B, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying in the plane and passing through the center of the molecule.\n*   Point Group: The combination of these elements defines the **D3h** point group. Like molecule B, it technically \"has\" C3h symmetry, but its full point group is D3h.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate (B(O-i-Pr)3)**\n*   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B(O)3 core is planar.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   Due to the propeller-like arrangement of the three isopropoxy groups around the boron atom, there is a C3 axis passing through the boron, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups are bulky and prevent the molecule from being planar. The lowest energy conformation has C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a specific conformation (even if it's not the most stable one) that possesses a σh plane. This conformation would have the B(O)3 plane as the mirror plane, with the three isopropyl groups arranged so that for each group, one methyl is above the plane and one is below, with the C-H bond of the isopropyl's central carbon lying in the plane.\n    *   In this conformation, the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Crucially, this molecule lacks the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, and it also lacks any σv planes. The bulky, asymmetric nature of the isopropyl groups prevents these additional symmetry elements.\n*   Point Group: The absence of C2 axes and σv planes means the point group cannot be D3h or C3v. The highest possible symmetry point group for triisopropyl borate is **C3h**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Molecules B and C are D3h. They have higher symmetry than C3h.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose highest possible symmetry is C3h. In questions of this type, we look for the molecule that belongs to the specified point group, not a higher symmetry supergroup.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry among the given options. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine its point group.\n\nA point group is a set of symmetry operations (like rotation, reflection, inversion) that leave a molecule unchanged. A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess a C3 rotation axis (rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.

The BO3 core is expected to be trigonal planar. This would define a potential C3 axis perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n    *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are bulky and not planar. Due to steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups will rotate and twist out of the BO3 plane into a stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   This conformation will resemble a three-bladed propeller. It will have a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   But, because the groups are twisted, there will be no horizontal mirror plane (σh) containing the BO3 core. The molecule is chiral.\n    *   The point group of triisopropyl borate in its most stable conformation is C3.\n\n2.  **Quinuclidine (B)**\n    *   Formula: C7H13N (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)\n    *   Structure: This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is a C3 rotation axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite CH bridgehead carbon.\n    *   The molecule also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that pass through the C3 axis and bisect the ethylene bridges.\n    *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is C3v.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   Common Name: Mellitic trianhydride\n    *   Formula: C12O9\n    *   Structure: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring to which three pyromellitic anhydride rings (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) are fused. Specifically, they are fused to the 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 positions of the benzene ring.\n    *   The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Additionally, the molecule possesses three C2 rotation axes lying within the molecular plane and passing through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central ring (e.g., one axis through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds).\n    *   Because it has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, its point group is D3h. While a D3h object does have C3h symmetry (C3h is a subgroup of D3h), its full symmetry designation is D3h.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This molecule has a triphenylene core (a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings with D3h symmetry).

So it possesses the required elements for at least C3h symmetry.\n    *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. The parent triphenylene has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. However, the anhydride group, -C(=O)-O-C(=O)-, is not symmetric with respect to a C2 rotation along an axis that bisects the bond it is fused to. The oxygen atom is on one side of the anhydride ring. If we assume the oxygen atoms of the three anhydride rings are all oriented in a \"clockwise\" or \"propeller-like\" fashion, a C2 rotation would not superimpose the molecule onto itself. The C2 axes of the triphenylene core are therefore destroyed.\n    *   Since there are no perpendicular C2 axes, and no vertical mirror planes (σv), the highest point group for this molecule is C3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n*   Molecule B belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n*   Molecule C belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n*   Molecule D belongs to the **C3** point group.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule A is the only one whose point group is precisely C3h. Molecule C has D3h symmetry, which is a higher symmetry group that contains all the elements of C3h, but typically these questions ask for the exact point group. Therefore, molecule A is the best and most specific answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n*   **A C3 axis of rotation**: Rotation by 360/3 = 120° about this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. Crucially, a C3h molecule **lacks** any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any vertical mirror planes (σv), as these would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule provided:\n\n*   **C) quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a rigid bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes places it in the **C3v** point group.\n\n*   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule (C12O9) consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride-like groups fused to its sides. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places it in the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule (C18O9) is similar to the one above but is based on a larger, planar triphenylene core. It is also planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Just like the previous molecule, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a σh plane (the molecular plane), three perpendicular C2 axes, and three σv planes.\n    *   **Point Group**: It also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **B) triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its possible conformations.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n        *   **Ground State Conformation**: To minimize steric repulsion between the bulky isopropyl groups, the molecule typically adopts a propeller-like conformation. In this shape, all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction relative to the central BO3 plane. This conformation has a C3 axis, but it lacks a σh plane. Thus, its ground-state point group is **C3**.\n        *   **Existence of a C3h Conformation**: The question asks if the molecule *has* C3h symmetry, which could refer to any possible conformation, not just the lowest energy one. It is possible to construct a conformation of triisopropyl borate that has C3h symmetry:\n            1.  Imagine the boron, the three oxygen atoms, and the three central carbons of the isopropyl groups (the methine carbons) all lie in a single plane. This will be our candidate for the σh plane.\n            2.  For each isopropyl group, place the two methyl (CH3) groups symmetrically, with one above the plane and one below it. The hydrogen atom of the methine group (CH) would lie within the plane.\n            3.  If the three in-plane C-H bonds are all pointed radially outward, the molecule would have D3h symmetry. However, if we \"crank\" or twist all three C-H bonds in the plane by the same angle (while keeping them in the plane), we break the perpendicular C2 axes and the σv planes.\n            4.  This specific, \"cranked\" conformation retains the C3 axis and the σh plane but loses the extra symmetry elements of D3h. Therefore, this conformation belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecules A and D belong to the D3h point group. While D3h is a supergroup of C3h (meaning it has all the symmetry elements of C3h), it's a more symmetric group.\n*   Molecule C belongs to the C3v point group.\n*   Molecule B is the only one that can adopt a conformation whose point group is exactly **C3h**. In chemical point group problems, we look for the molecule that fits the specified group precisely.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer because it is the only molecule among the choices that can possess C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which molecule has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Understanding C3h Symmetry\nA molecule possesses C3h symmetry if it belongs to the C3h point group. The key symmetry elements for this group are:\n1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is unchanged after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A **σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule is unchanged after reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nThe C3h point group also includes an S3 improper rotation axis, which is a consequence of having both a C3 axis and a σh plane (S3 = C3 * σh).\n\nIt is important to note that a molecule belonging to a higher symmetry point group that contains all the elements of C3h (like D3h) also \"has C3h symmetry\". The D3h point group contains a C3 axis, a σh plane, and additionally three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule provided:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (B)**:\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with a highly rigid structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead C-H group.\n    *   However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. Instead, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**:\n    *   The formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. The core BO3 unit is trigonal planar.\n    *   Due to significant steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, the molecule adopts a propeller-like conformation.\n    *   This propeller structure has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   The point group of the lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry. While a high-energy conformation with C3h symmetry could theoretically be constructed on paper, it is not the molecule's representative structure.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   This complex IUPAC name describes an isomer of mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). The structure consists of a central benzene ring symmetrically fused with three anhydride-like rings.\n    *   The molecule is a large, rigid, polycyclic system which is known to be planar.\n    *   The planar structure has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Furthermore, due to the high symmetry of the fusion, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of this molecule is **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule has C3h symmetry.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   This name describes a larger analogue of the molecule in option D. The core is triphenylene instead of benzene.\n    *   Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The fusion pattern `[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']` is C3-symmetric, adding three anhydride-like rings to the periphery of the triphenylene core.\n    *   The resulting molecule is a large, planar, and highly symmetric disc-shaped molecule.\n    *   Like molecule D, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, a σh plane (the molecular plane), and three perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of this molecule is also **D3h**. As with option D, this means it possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth molecules A and D have D3h symmetry. Since the C3h point group is a subgroup of the D3h point group, both molecules possess the required C3 and σh symmetry elements. In a multiple-choice question where only one answer can be correct, this presents an ambiguity. However, if the question is well-posed, we must choose the best fit. Both structures described in A and D are textbook examples of molecules with D3h symmetry. Without further information to distinguish between them (e.g., if one was non-planar due to strain, or one name was invalid), both A and D are technically correct. Often in such cases, any example with the superset symmetry (D3h) is considered a valid answer. Given that both A and D are of the D3h point group, and the question is likely from a standard source, either molecule would be a correct example. Let's select one of the valid options. Both A and D are correct examples of molecules with the required symmetry. Based on the options, let's select A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\n*   **Analysis of C3h Symmetry**\n    A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule can be rotated by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis and remain indistinguishable.\n    2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule must have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    The presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The point group consists of the symmetry operations {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Candidate Molecules**\n\n    1.  **A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B atom and the three O atoms (the BO3 core) are trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry: Due to the bulkiness of the isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie in the BO3 plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they adopt a propeller-like arrangement, where they are all twisted in the same direction out of the BO3 plane.\n        *   This propeller conformation possesses a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms above the plane does not result in equivalent atoms below the plane.\n        *   Conclusion: The stable ground-state conformation of triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h. A C3h structure would represent a high-energy transition state, not the equilibrium geometry.\n\n    2.  **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n        *   Structure: A cage-like bicyclic amine with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n        *   Symmetry: It has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the N atom and the opposing bridgehead C-H group. Rotation by 120 degrees maps the three bridges onto one another.\n        *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis, because the N-end of the molecule is different from the CH-end.\n        *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n        *   Conclusion: Quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group.\n\n    3.  **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (mellitic trianhydride)**\n        *   Structure: This molecule is the trianhydride of mellitic acid. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride groups [-C(O)OC(O)-] on alternating sides.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar. Its plane of planarity acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   Crucially, in addition to C3 and σh, this molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule and passing through the center. This higher degree of symmetry places it in a different point group.\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of C3, σh, and 3C2 axes means the molecule's point group is D3h. While it contains the C3h symmetry elements, its full point group is D3h. Typically, such questions ask for the molecule whose full and correct point group is the one specified.\n\n    4.  **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   Structure: This is a larger analogue of molecule D. It has a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The three-fold symmetric arrangement of the anhydride groups preserves the C3 axis of the triphenylene core.\n        *   However, the anhydride groups [-C(O)OC(O)-] lack the internal symmetry to preserve the C2 axes or the vertical mirror planes (σv) of the parent D3h triphenylene framework. For example, a C2 axis would need to map the -CO-O-CO- group onto itself after a 180° rotation, which is not possible.\n        *   Conclusion: By removing the C2 and σv elements but retaining C3 and σh, the symmetry of the molecule is reduced from D3h to C3h. This molecule's point group is exactly C3h.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    -   Molecule A has C3 symmetry.\n    -   Molecule C has C3v symmetry.\n    -   Molecule D has D3h symmetry.\n    -   Molecule B has C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule possesses C3h symmetry if it has the following symmetry elements:\n*   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n*   A **σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule looks identical after a reflection through a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n*   The point group should not belong to a higher symmetry group (like D3h) that also contains these elements. The question asks for the molecule whose complete symmetry designation is C3h.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n*   **B) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   **Structure:** A cage-like molecule with a nitrogen (N) at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, connected by three -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the N atom and the opposing C atom of the CH group. Rotating by 120° interchanges the three ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis, as reflecting the N atom through such a plane would not land on the C atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. This is not C3h.\n\n*   **D) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n    *   **Structure:** A central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is approximately trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   However, due to steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, they will twist out of the BO3 plane into a \"propeller\" conformation. In this lowest-energy conformation, all three groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller arrangement breaks the horizontal mirror symmetry. There is no σh plane.\n    *   **Point Group:** The ground-state conformation has a C3 axis but lacks other elements like σh or C2 axes. Its point group is **C3**. This is not C3h. (While a high-energy, unstable eclipsed conformation might theoretically have a σh plane, chemical point groups refer to the stable ground-state structure).\n\n*   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic anhydride)**\n    *   **Structure:** A planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three cyclic anhydride groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It is planar, so it has a mirror plane in the plane of the molecule (σh).\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition to the C3 axis and σh plane, it has further symmetry. There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane (perpendicular to the C3 axis). Each C2 axis passes through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 group family. The additional presence of the σh plane elevates the symmetry to **D3h**.\n    *   **Point Group:** Since the molecule belongs to the higher symmetry group D3h, it is not correctly classified as C3h.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** A planar molecule consisting of a central triphenylene core fused with three cyclic anhydride groups in a C3-symmetric fashion.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It is a planar molecule, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the triphenylene system.\n        *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. The triphenylene core itself has D3h symmetry, which includes three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. However, the anhydride groups are fused onto the 'sides' of the triphenylene system (positions [1,2], [5,6], [9,10]). This arrangement of substituents is not symmetric with respect to the C2 axes of the parent triphenylene. Therefore, these C2 axes are eliminated by the substitution.\n        *   Similarly, the vertical mirror planes (σv) of the triphenylene core are also eliminated.\n    *   **Point Group:** The molecule is left with only the C3 axis and the σh plane (and the corresponding S3 axis and identity element). This set of symmetry elements defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   A) triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   B) quinuclidine: **C3v**\n*   C) benzo[...]hexaone: **D3h**\n*   D) triisopropyl borate: **C3**\n\nThe only molecule that has C3h symmetry is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand the C3h Symmetry Point Group**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n*   A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) around this axis leaves the molecule's appearance unchanged.\n*   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting all atoms through this plane leaves the molecule's appearance unchanged.\n\nCrucially, to belong to the C3h point group and not a higher symmetry group like D3h, the molecule must *lack* other symmetry elements, such as C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis or vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule**\n\n*   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic Trianhydride)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a **σh plane**.\n        *   However, it *also* has three **C2 axes** lying in the molecular plane, passing through the bonds connecting the anhydride groups.\n        *   It also possesses vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it has the additional C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis, its point group is **D3h**. While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is described by a higher-order group.\n\n*   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger planar molecule with a triphenylene core, which is essentially three benzene rings fused together. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to molecule A, this large, disc-like molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** through its center, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane is a **σh plane**.\n        *   It also has perpendicular **C2 axes** and **σv planes**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Like molecule A, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n*   **D) Quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions, linked by three two-carbon (ethylene) chains.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   However, there is **no horizontal mirror plane (σh)** perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting the top half (near the N) through a perpendicular plane does not produce the bottom half (near the CH).\n        *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Its point group is **C3v**.\n\n*   **C) Triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure:** B(O-iPr)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]. Molecules with single bonds like B-O and O-C can adopt various conformations due to free rotation. We need to see if a plausible conformation exists with C3h symmetry.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Let's construct a C3h conformation:\n        *   Place the central boron (B) atom at the origin of a coordinate system. Place the C3 axis along the z-axis.\n        *   Arrange the three oxygen atoms in the xy-plane, forming an equilateral triangle around the boron. This xy-plane will be our potential **σh plane**.\n        *   For each of the three isopropyl groups, let's also place the central carbon atom (the 'CH' part) in the xy-plane. This is sterically possible.\n        *   Now, consider the two methyl groups (-CH3) and the single hydrogen (-H) attached to this carbon. For the xy-plane to be a mirror plane, we must arrange these attachments symmetrically above and below the plane. This can be achieved if the hydrogen atom also lies in the xy-plane, and one methyl group is positioned above the plane while the other is an exact mirror image below the plane.\n        *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this same orientation, the entire molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n        *   Does this conformation have other symmetries? If we try to find a C2 axis perpendicular to the C3 axis, we fail. Rotating 180° around an axis in the plane (e.g., along a B-O bond) does not leave the molecule unchanged because the 'up' and 'down' methyl groups would be swapped into non-equivalent positions. It also lacks σv planes for similar reasons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a specific conformation that belongs precisely to the **C3h** point group. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformation (which is calculated to have C3 symmetry), its existence makes it the only correct answer among the choices for a molecule that has (i.e., can have) C3h symmetry without belonging to a higher symmetry group.\n\n**Final Answer determination**\n- Molecule A and B belong to the D3h point group.\n- Molecule D belongs to the C3v point group.\n- Molecule C is the only one that can exhibit a structure belonging to the C3h point group.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to identify which of the four given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Define C3h Symmetry:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** This is a principal axis of rotation. When the molecule is rotated by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis, it remains unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** This is a plane of symmetry that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. If you reflect all atoms through this plane, the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if its complete set of symmetry operations consists of the identity (E), C3 rotations (C3, C3²), a horizontal reflection (σh), and improper rotations (S3, S3⁵). The key is the presence of *both* a C3 axis and a σh plane, and the absence of other elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes that would place it in a higher symmetry group like C3v or D3h. However, in multiple-choice questions, \"has C3h symmetry\" can sometimes mean \"possesses at least a C3 axis and a σh plane\".\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n        *   Structure: It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-iPr). The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry: There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. However, the three isopropyl groups are bulky and sterically hindered. To minimize this repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a propeller-like fashion. This twisting eliminates the possibility of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that would coincide with the BO3 plane.\n        *   Conclusion: The molecule has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Its point group is C3. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):**\n        *   Structure: This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n        *   Symmetry: It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (CH). A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular (horizontal) to this C3 axis. There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   Conclusion: The molecule has a C3 axis and σv planes, but no σh plane. Its point group is C3v. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   Common Name: This is also known as mellitic trianhydride (C12O9).\n        *   Structure: It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to its alternating sides.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar.\n            *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n            *   The plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   Because the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane, it meets the minimum requirements.\n            *   Upon further inspection, it also has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of these additional symmetry elements means its full point group is actually D3h.\n        *   Conclusion: While the molecule's point group is D3h, it is the only option that possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane. A D3h group contains all the symmetry operations of the C3h group. In the context of this question, it is the best fit.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   Structure: This is a larger version of molecule B, built on a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core.\n        *   Symmetry: Unlike molecule B, this molecule is not planar. The steric hindrance between the oxygen atoms of adjacent anhydride groups (in the \"bay regions\") forces the molecule to twist into a helical, propeller-like shape.\n        *   Conclusion: This twisted structure has a C3 axis, but because it is non-planar, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its point group is C3. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   Molecule A: C3 (has C3, no σh)\n    *   Molecule B: D3h (has C3, has σh)\n    *   Molecule C: C3 (has C3, no σh)\n    *   Molecule D: C3v (has C3, no σh)\n\n    Only molecule B possesses the essential combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Although its complete point group (D3h) is of higher symmetry than C3h, it is the only choice that contains the defining elements of C3h symmetry. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A C3 axis of rotation: Rotation by 120° about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  A σh horizontal mirror plane: A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**D) Quinuclidine** (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)\n*   **Structure**: This is a cage-like molecule with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and bisect one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. A plane in the middle of the cage would not reflect the top half onto the bottom half.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane defines the **C3v** point group. Thus, quinuclidine is not C3h.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone** (Mellitic trianhydride)\n*   **Structure**: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups (-C(O)-O-C(O)-) on alternating sides. The formula is C12O9. The molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   Being planar, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   In addition to these, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, each passing through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central ring.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D point group family.\n*   **Point Group**: A C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane define the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains the C3h symmetry elements (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. Usually, questions about point groups ask for the highest possible point group describing the molecule's entire symmetry.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is a planar D3h molecule. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically onto the outer rings of the triphenylene structure.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: Like the triphenylene core, the resulting large molecule is also planar. The high symmetry is preserved. It possesses:\n    *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   A σh horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane).\n    *   Three C2 axes within the plane.\n*   **Point Group**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule has **D3h** symmetry. It is of a higher symmetry order than C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The arrangement around the boron atom is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: We need to consider possible conformations.\n    *   The lowest energy conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape, where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction to minimize steric hindrance. This conformation has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes, giving it a C3 point group.\n    *   However, it is possible to envision an idealized, higher-energy conformation that exhibits C3h symmetry. In this conformation:\n        1.  The boron atom, the three oxygen atoms, the three adjacent carbons (methine carbons), and their attached hydrogens lie in a single plane. This plane can act as the σh mirror plane.\n        2.  For each isopropyl group, one methyl group (-CH3) is positioned above this plane, and the other is below it.\n        3.  The molecule has a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n    *   This specific conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. Does it have other symmetry elements, like the perpendicular C2 axes that would raise it to D3h? No. Because the B-O-C bond is bent (not 180°), the isopropyl groups are \"cranked\" relative to the B-O bonds. If you attempt a C2 rotation along one B-O bond, the other two isopropyl groups do not map onto each other.\n*   **Point Group**: Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule on the list for which **C3h** is its highest possible point group (even if it's for an idealized conformation).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMolecules A and C have D3h symmetry. Molecule D has C3v symmetry. Molecule B is the only one that fits the C3h point group without belonging to a higher symmetry group. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\n*   **Analysis of the Symmetry of Each Molecule**\n\nTo determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule and determine its point group. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 principal axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. It lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. Three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges connect the two bridgeheads.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon. A 120° rotation around this axis maps each ethylene bridge onto the next.\n        *   It has three **vertical mirror planes (σv)**. Each plane contains the C3 axis and bisects one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   It **lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh)** perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane means its point group is **C3v**.\n\n2.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, planar aromatic core called triphenylene, to which three anhydride-like groups are fused.

Although D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h (E, C3, σh, S3), it is a higher symmetry point group.

Triphenylene is larger and the fusion points are sterically hindered.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Due to severe steric strain, the molecule cannot be planar. The anhydride rings are twisted out of the main plane, resulting in a propeller-like, helical structure.\n    *   It retains a C3 axis through the center, perpendicular to the general plane of the molecule.\n    *   However, because it is non-planar and twisted, it **lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.

The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Let's consider a plausible, high-symmetry conformation.\n    *   Place the trigonal planar B(O)3 group in the xy plane. The principal axis is the C3 axis (z-axis), passing through the boron atom perpendicular to this plane.\n    *   For the molecule to have a σh plane, this plane must be the xy plane containing the B(O)3 core. For this to be a mirror plane for the whole molecule, the isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it.\n    *   Consider one isopropyl group, -O-CH(CH3)2. If we orient it such that the methine C-H bond also lies in the σh plane, one methyl group (-CH3) will be above the plane, and the other will be below. Reflection in the σh plane will exchange the positions of these two methyl groups, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this conformation, arranged symmetrically around the C3 axis, the entire molecule will have a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements.

A molecule whose point group is a supergroup of C3h (e.g., D3h) also possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three oxygen atoms prefer a trigonal planar arrangement (the BO3 core).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie flat in the same plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a concerted, propeller-like fashion.\n*   **Point Group:** This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks any mirror planes, including a horizontal one (σh), because reflecting across the BO3 plane would not result in an identical molecule. Therefore, its point group is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon and hydrogen. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its \"bay\" regions. Triphenylene itself is a large, planar aromatic system.\n*   **Symmetry:** While one might expect this large fused system to be planar, there is significant steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings. This strain forces the molecule to distort from planarity, twisting into a non-planar, helical, propeller-like shape.\n*   **Point Group:** This twisted structure loses its horizontal mirror plane (σh). It retains the C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it. Its point group is **D3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry:** Unlike the larger triphenylene derivative, this molecule is small enough that it can maintain a perfectly planar structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane means the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. In fact, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, making its full point group **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **3.

Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n    *   The C3h point group also contains an S3 improper rotation axis and an identity element (E). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient to define the C3h point group.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three maleic anhydride-like rings. The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   It has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   It has a σh plane, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It also has three σv planes (vertical mirror planes) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Boron is the central atom, bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   The B(OC)3 core is planar due to sp2 hybridization of the boron atom. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. The C-H bond of the isopropyl group (the one attached to oxygen) will lie roughly in the BO3 plane, and the two methyl groups of each isopropyl will be positioned one above and one below the plane.\n        *   Let's check for the C3h symmetry elements:\n            *   **C3 axis:** Yes, the axis passing through the boron atom perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule 120° around this axis exchanges the positions of the three -O-iPr groups.\n            *   **σh plane:** Let's consider the plane containing the B and three O atoms as a potential horizontal mirror plane. For this to be a σh plane, reflecting through it must leave the molecule unchanged. If we reflect one isopropyl group through this plane, the methyl group above the plane moves to the position of the methyl group below the plane, and vice versa. This operation leaves each isopropyl group, and thus the entire molecule, unchanged.\n        *   Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it, it belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core.\n        *   Due to its planarity and propeller-like shape, it possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, like molecule A, it also has three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a σh plane.\n        *   The combination of C3, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:** This is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the N atom and the opposing C-H bridgehead.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the -(CH2)2- bridges.\n        *   The molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through such a plane would move the nitrogen atom to the CH group's position, which is not an equivalent configuration.\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has the required C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, correctly assigning it to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal threefold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of a threefold axis of improper rotation (S3).\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** Quinuclidine (C7H13N) is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. The nitrogen atom and a CH group are at the two bridgehead positions.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylenic (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it is not C3h.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** Triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3, has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The BO3 core is likely to be trigonal planar, which would allow for a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n        *   For the molecule to have C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) must exist, which would coincide with the BO3 plane.\n        *   Let's examine an isopropoxy group, -OCH(CH3)2. For the σh plane to be a symmetry element, the group must be symmetric upon reflection through this plane. If the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies in the plane, one methyl group (-CH3) would be above the plane and the other below. Reflection would swap their positions, but a methyl group is not a mirror image of another methyl group in this configuration. The atoms within the methyl groups would not map onto each other.\n        *   Due to the steric bulk and free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule is likely to adopt a \"propeller\" conformation (point group C3) or a conformation with no symmetry at all (point group C1) to minimize steric strain. A C3h conformation is sterically unfavorable and geometrically impossible.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three dicarboxylic anhydride groups are fused, forming a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition, there are three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and bisecting the sides of the central benzene ring that are not part of the anhydride fusions.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis with three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The presence of a σh plane makes the point group **D3h**.\n        *   While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, the question asks for the molecule that *has* C3h symmetry, which implies assigning the highest point group. The point group for this molecule is D3h, not C3h.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a trianhydride derivative of triphenylene. It consists of a planar triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its outer bays.

Unlike mellitic trianhydride (D) or triphenylene itself, this molecule does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The \"propeller-like\" arrangement of the anhydride groups around the core breaks these symmetries.\n        *   The only symmetry elements are the identity (E), C3 rotation, and the horizontal mirror plane (σh) (which also implies an S3 improper rotation). This set of symmetry elements defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine: C3v\n*   Triisopropyl borate: Not C3h (likely C3 or C1)\n*   Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   Benzo[...]hexaone: D3h\n\nTherefore, the molecule that has C3h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n2.  A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\nCrucially, a molecule in the C3h point group must *not* have additional symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or D3d.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2.\n*   **Flexibility**: This molecule is conformationally flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds. We need to see if a conformation with C3h symmetry is possible.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Let's place the central boron atom at the origin and the three oxygen atoms in the xy-plane. The axis perpendicular to this plane (the z-axis) is a potential C3 axis.\n    *   For the xy-plane to be a σh mirror plane, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon and its attached hydrogen (-CH) lie within the xy-plane. The two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to that carbon would then be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this orientation, arranged 120° apart around the boron, the entire molecule would possess a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements in this specific conformation. There would be no vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   Therefore, a plausible, albeit perhaps not the lowest-energy, conformation of triisopropyl borate exists that belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It is a rigid, planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Being planar, the plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   However, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   These combined symmetry elements place the molecule in the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of mellitic trianhydride, built upon a triphenylene core. It is also a rigid, planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, a σh plane, three perpendicular C2 axes, and three vertical σv planes.\n    *   Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOf the four options, quinuclidine (C3v), mellitic trianhydride (D3h), and the triphenylene derivative (D3h) have rigid structures that do not belong to the C3h point group. Only triisopropyl borate is conformationally flexible, and a specific, high-symmetry conformation exists that perfectly fits the C3h point group requirements.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It does not contain any vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n\n1.  **Analyze Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. The two bridgeheads are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each passing through the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B-O3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule can adopt a specific conformation. In this conformation, the plane containing the boron and the three oxygen atoms acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   For this to be a σh plane, each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2] must be oriented symmetrically with respect to this plane. This is achieved if the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies within the plane, with one methyl group positioned above the plane and the other below it.\n        *   The C3 rotation maps each of the three identical isopropyl groups onto the next.\n        *   The σh reflection swaps the \"up\" and \"down\" methyl groups on each isopropyl group, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Point Group**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or any σv planes. This corresponds exactly to the **C3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Analyze Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused to three anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: Due to severe steric hindrance between the adjacent anhydride groups, the molecule is not planar. It twists into a propeller-like shape.\n        *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the general plane.\n        *   However, because of the twisting, it loses all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and any C2 axes.\n    *   **Point Group**: With only a C3 axis, the point group is **C3**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure**: This compound is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three dicarboxylic anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center and bisecting opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of C3, 3 C2, σh, and 3 σv defines the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. In point group classification, the highest possible symmetry group is used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is C3h.\n*   The triphenylene derivative is C3.\n*   The benzo derivative (mellitic trianhydride) is D3h.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose point group is precisely C3h.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Understand the C3h Point Group:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has a principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis, rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. The point group also includes an S3 improper rotation axis, but the C3 and σh elements are sufficient for identification.\n\n2.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3):**\n        *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (BO3 core). Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n        *   **Symmetry:** The BO3 core is planar and has a C3 axis perpendicular to its plane. To have C3h symmetry, the entire molecule must be symmetric with respect to a reflection through the BO3 plane (this plane would be the σh). However, each isopropyl group has a central sp3-hybridized carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen and two methyl groups. It is impossible to arrange these atoms so that they are symmetric upon reflection through the BO3 plane. Due to steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups twist out of the plane, creating a propeller-like structure. The most stable conformation of this molecule has C3 symmetry, not C3h.\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.\n        *   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing carbon-hydrogen (CH) group. The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places this molecule in the C3v point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so it is not C3h.\n\n    *   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to its adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (1-2, 3-4, 5-6).\n        *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is completely planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). However, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and passing through the centers of the C-C bonds shared by the benzene and anhydride rings. A point group with a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane is a D3h point group. While D3h symmetry includes the C3 and σh elements, the molecule is assigned to the higher symmetry D3h point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a triphenylene core with three anhydride rings fused into its \"bay\" regions. Due to severe steric hindrance between the anhydride groups, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, twisted, propeller-like shape.\n        *   **Symmetry:** This twisting destroys the C2 axes and σv planes that would exist in a planar analogue, so its symmetry is lower than D3h. The propeller shape retains the C3 axis. A simple twist would result in C3 symmetry. However, chemical literature, including computational studies on this specific molecule, reports the existence of a stable, low-energy conformation that possesses C3h symmetry. While its absolute ground state may be C3, the question asks which molecule *has* this symmetry, and an accessible, well-characterized conformation is a valid interpretation.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    By eliminating the other options, which unambiguously belong to C3, C3v, and D3h point groups, the most plausible answer is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. It is the only molecule among the choices for which C3h symmetry is specifically attributed in scientific literature, even if it is as a low-energy conformation rather than the ground state.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (D)**\n    *   Structure: Quinuclidine is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is higher than C3h.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This is a larger planar molecule based on a triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings).

It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three O atoms form a planar BO3 core.\n    *   Symmetry analysis: The overall symmetry depends on the conformation (rotation) of the three flexible isopropyl groups.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n        *   If the isopropyl groups arrange themselves so that the methine C-H bonds lie within the BO3 plane, and for each group, one methyl (CH3) is above the plane and one is below, the BO3 plane becomes a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In this specific conformation, there are no perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n        *   This conformation perfectly fits the requirements for the **C3h** point group.\n    *   Note: While the lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate is a \"propeller\" shape with C3 symmetry due to steric hindrance, the C3h conformation is a plausible, albeit higher-energy, arrangement. In the context of a multiple-choice question where the other options definitively belong to different point groups (C3v and D3h), triisopropyl borate is the only molecule that can be correctly assigned the C3h point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: Can adopt a **C3h** conformation.\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3v\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.

This conformation would have a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom.\n    *   **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane would require the entire molecule to be planar or for each isopropyl group to be bisected by the plane in a way that reflects it onto itself. An isopropyl group does not possess this symmetry. Therefore, there is no σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate likely has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**D) Quinuclidine**\n\n*   **Structure**: 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It's a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   **C3 axis**: Yes, there is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H).\n    *   **σh plane**: No. A plane perpendicular to this C3 axis would cut through the three ethylene bridges. Reflecting across such a plane does not result in an identical molecule.\n    *   **Other elements**: The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group for quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a large, planar triphenylene core. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically into the three \"bay\" regions of the triphenylene system.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   **C3 axis**: Yes, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. A 120° rotation maps each anhydride-fused bay onto the next.\n    *   **σh plane**: Yes, the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n    *   **Other elements**: Let's check for other elements that would raise the symmetry.\n        *   *C2 axes perpendicular to C3?* No. A 180° rotation around an axis in the plane would not map the molecule onto itself due to the asymmetric shape of the fused anhydride groups.\n        *   *σv vertical planes?* No. A mirror plane containing the C3 axis would have to bisect the molecule, but the fused groups are not internally symmetric with respect to such a plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but lacks the C2 axes or σv planes that would raise it to a higher symmetry group like D3h or C3v. Therefore, its point group is exactly **C3h**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nComparing the four molecules:\n*   A) Mellitic trianhydride is D3h.\n*   B) Triisopropyl borate is likely C3.\n*   D) Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   C) The triphenylene derivative is **C3h**.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. In the context of point group determination, this means which molecule's complete set of symmetry operations corresponds to the C3h point group. Molecule C is the only one that fits this description perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\nA molecule belonging to the C3h point group must have these elements but must *not* have additional elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, flat (planar) molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to the outer rings.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane.\n    *   It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of the C3 axis, the σh plane, and the perpendicular C2 axes means its point group is **D3h**. Since D3h has more symmetry elements than C3h, this is not the correct answer, assuming the question asks for the molecule whose point group is *exactly* C3h.\n\n**B) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   It does **not** have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group**: The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**. This is incorrect.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It is a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry**: The symmetry analysis is identical to molecule A. It is a planar molecule with a C3 axis, a σh plane, three perpendicular C2 axes, and three σv planes.\n*   **Point Group**: The point group is **D3h**. Like A, this is not the best answer.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, which is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. This molecule is not rigid; the isopropyl groups can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. To assign a point group, we consider its most stable, lowest-energy conformation.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   The central part, B(O)3, is trigonal planar. We can define a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms, passing through the central boron atom.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three bulky isopropyl groups arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion, preserving the C3 axis.\n    *   A plausible low-energy conformation can be achieved where the B-O-C plane is twisted, and the methyl groups are arranged to create a horizontal mirror plane (σh). For example, a conformation where the three O atoms are in one plane, and the three methine carbons are in another parallel plane, with the methyl groups arranged symmetrically. A simpler-to-visualize C3h conformation has the B(O)3 core and the three methine carbons in the σh plane, with one methyl group of each isopropyl pointing \"up\" and the other \"down\" relative to the plane.\n    *   This conformation possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane. It does not have any perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n*   **Point Group**: A stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3h** symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMolecules A and C have D3h symmetry. Molecule B has C3v symmetry. Molecule D is the only one for which a stable conformation has the exact C3h point group. Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of the options:**\n    The question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis, but lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis or any vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the presence of a three-fold improper rotation axis (S3).\n\n1.  **A) Quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. The nitrogen atom and the opposing methine (CH) group are at the bridgeheads. Three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges connect them.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes results in the **C3v** point group.\n\n2.  **B) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n    *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is likely trigonal planar. However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   Due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule can adopt various conformations. The most symmetrical conformation would likely have the three isopropoxy groups arranged like a propeller, twisted in the same direction. This conformation would possess a C3 axis perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   However, it is not possible for this molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). A plane containing the BO3 core would not symmetrically relate the two methyl groups of each isopropyl unit.\n    *   **Point Group:** The highest symmetry achievable is likely **C3**.\n\n3.  **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings [-C(=O)O(C=O)-] are fused, one to each pair of adjacent carbon atoms of the benzene ring.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflection through this plane leaves the planar molecule unchanged.\n        *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane (and the absence of other elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h) confirms its point group is **C3h**.\n\n4.  **D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger analogue of the previous molecule, based on a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. Three anhydride rings are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   Like the previous molecule, this molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   **Crucially**, it also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the centers of the bonds connecting the benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n1.  **Analyze the C3h point group:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The presence of these two symmetry elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n2.  **Analyze molecule A: triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n    *   The central B atom is bonded to three -O-iPr groups. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n    *   For a σh plane to exist, this plane would have to contain the B and three O atoms. However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar and their atoms (C and H) do not have corresponding atoms reflected through this plane. For example, the H atom on the central carbon of the isopropyl group will be on one side of the plane with no counterpart on the other. Therefore, it lacks a σh plane. Its most likely point group is C3, assuming a propeller-like conformation.\n\n3.  **Analyze molecule B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride)**\n    *   This molecule is derived from benzene by replacing all six hydrogen atoms with three dicarboxylic anhydride groups.\n    *   The central benzene ring is planar. The anhydride groups (-C(O)OC(O)-) are also planar.\n    *   The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. Rotating by 120° maps the molecule onto itself.\n    *   A C2 axis passes through the midpoint of each C-C bond of the benzene ring that is part of an anhydride group, and through the center of the opposite C-C bond. There are three such C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   A σh plane exists, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group D3h. The σh plane is also consistent with D3h.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule has D3h symmetry, not C3h.\n\n4.  **Analyze molecule C: quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4). Rotation by 120° around this axis interchanges the three ethylenic bridges (-CH2-CH2-).\n    *   Looking down the C3 axis, there are three mirror planes (σv) that each contain the N, C4, and one of the CH2-CH2 bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflecting the N atom through a plane halfway along the N-C4 bond does not land on the C4 atom.\n    *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the C3v point group.\n\n5.  **Analyze molecule D: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   This molecule has a large, rigid, polycyclic aromatic core (triphenylene) with three furanone anhydride groups fused to it.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of the core and the substituents. The triphenylene core has D3h symmetry. The three anhydride groups are attached in a symmetric, propeller-like fashion.\n    *   Let's place the molecule in a coordinate system with the z-axis passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its general plane. This z-axis is a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   Now, let's consider a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the xy-plane, located at the center of the molecule's thickness. The triphenylene core is planar and would lie in this plane. However, the furanone anhydride groups are not planar. Each anhydride group has two carbonyl oxygens. In the lowest energy conformation, to relieve steric strain, these groups are twisted out of the plane of the aromatic core. The three groups twist in the same direction, creating a propeller-like shape.\n    *   Due to this twisting, the molecule is not planar. For a σh plane to exist, for every atom at position (x, y, z), there must be an identical atom at (x, y, -z). This is not the case here. The carbonyl oxygen atoms are all pointing somewhat \"up\" or \"down\" relative to the central plane, but there is no corresponding set on the opposite side.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule lacks a σh plane. It also lacks the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and the σv planes because of the twist. The only remaining symmetry element is the C3 axis. Thus, the point group of this molecule is C3.\n\n**Re-evaluation and Correction:**\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding of one of the structures or the question implies an idealized conformation. Let's reconsider molecule B.\n\n**Molecule B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   This molecule is also known as benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride.\n*   While an idealized structure is perfectly planar and thus D3h, steric hindrance between the adjacent carbonyl oxygen atoms forces the molecule to pucker out of the plane.\n*   The molecule distorts from planarity to relieve this strain. The central benzene ring adopts a chair-like or boat-like conformation, and the anhydride groups twist.\n*   In the most stable, calculated conformation, the molecule adopts a structure that possesses a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The six carbonyl oxygen atoms form two sets of three: one set pointing \"up\" and the other set pointing \"down\" relative to the central plane. The σh plane passes through the center of the molecule, reflecting the \"up\" set of atoms onto the \"down\" set. The C3 axis remains, passing through the center perpendicular to this plane.\n*   Therefore, the actual, non-planar ground state structure of this molecule has **C3h symmetry**. This is a known, if somewhat counter-intuitive, example in point group analysis.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Molecule A: C3\n*   Molecule B: C3h (due to steric-induced puckering)\n*   Molecule C: C3v\n*   Molecule D: C3\n\nThus, the molecule with C3h symmetry is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the C3h Point Group\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (C3): The molecule looks the same after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh): The molecule is symmetric with respect to reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n3.  An improper rotation axis of order 3 (S3): This is a consequence of having both C3 and σh (S3 = rotation by 120° followed by reflection in the horizontal plane).\nImportantly, a C3h molecule does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4).\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes puts quinuclidine in the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each connected to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, the molecule adopts a propeller-like conformation to minimize repulsion. The three O-iPr groups are twisted in the same direction relative to the central BO3 plane.\n    *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the approximate plane of the three oxygen atoms.\n    *   This conformation does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the isopropyl groups are twisted out of the plane, and the arrangement of the methyl groups breaks any potential in-plane reflection symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3** point group.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). The molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to alternating sides (i.e., to the C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6 bonds).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Let's check for C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. There are three such axes. Each axis passes through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of the benzene bonds that are *not* fused to anhydride rings (i.e., C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C1). A 180° rotation around one of these axes maps the molecule onto itself. For example, rotation around the axis bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds exchanges the anhydride at C1-C2 with the one at C3-C4, and maps the anhydride at C5-C6 onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This name describes a molecule with a triphenylene core (a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings, with D3h symmetry). Three anhydride-like \"trifuran...hexaone\" groups are fused to the core. The specified fusion sites [1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c''] in the standard IUPAC numbering for triphenylene would result in an asymmetric molecule. However, in symmetry problems, such complex names often intend to describe a symmetrically substituted molecule. Let's assume the three groups are fused in a C3-symmetric fashion to the outer edges of the D3h triphenylene core (e.g., on bonds 2-3, 6-7, 10-11).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   The C3-symmetric substitution preserves the C3 axis of the triphenylene core.\n    *   Let's check for C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The original C2 axes of the triphenylene core pass through the midpoints of certain bonds. A rotation around any of these original C2 axes would map a substituted position (with an anhydride ring) to an unsubstituted position. Therefore, the original C2 axes are lost. No new C2 axes are created because of the 3-fold substitution pattern.\n    *   Similarly, any vertical mirror planes (σv) are also lost.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks perpendicular C2 axes and vertical σv planes. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Molecule A has C3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule B has C3v symmetry.\n*   Molecule C has D3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule D has C3 symmetry.\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n1.  **Analyze the C3h symmetry group:** A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n    *   A **σh mirror plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    The presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the presence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The C3h point group consists of the operations {E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^5}. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses at least a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, fused aromatic core (triphenylene) with three anhydride-like groups attached.\n        *   **Symmetry:** Due to severe steric hindrance between the fused rings, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, propeller-like shape. This twisted structure has a C3 axis passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its average plane. However, because it is twisted and chiral (like a propeller), it cannot have a mirror plane (σh). A reflection would convert the molecule into its mirror image (enantiomer).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This molecule belongs to the **C3** point group. It has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane.

The D3h point group is a supergroup of C3h, meaning it contains all the symmetry elements of C3h.\n\n    *   **C) triisopropyl borate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups, B(O-iPr)3.\n        *   **Symmetry:** The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar.

A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses a C3 axis (three-fold rotational symmetry) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, and no other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n\n    1.  **Quinuclidine (D):**\n        *   Structure: 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It's a cage-like molecule.\n        *   Symmetry elements: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   Point group: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places it in the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n    2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B):**\n        *   Structure: B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is isopropyl, -CH(CH3)2. The central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar geometry.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The molecule has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. The three isopropyl groups are likely arranged in a propeller-like fashion to minimize steric hindrance. In this conformation, the molecule lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the methyl groups of the isopropyl substituents are not located within the BO3 plane.\n        *   Point group: Its point group is **C3**.\n\n    3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C):**\n        *   Structure: This is a large, planar molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry) to which three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically.\n        *   Symmetry elements: Being planar, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the plane of the molecule. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. Crucially, due to the high symmetry of the triphenylene core and the symmetric placement of the anhydride groups, it also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   Point group: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places it in the **D3h** point group. While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n    4.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A):**\n        *   Structure: This molecule is mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (1-2, 3-4, 5-6). The molecule is planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n            *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   Unlike molecule C, it does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The asymmetry of the anhydride groups (the ether oxygen is on one side) breaks this potential symmetry. It also lacks vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Point group: The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, and the absence of any higher-order symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n    *   A) C3h\n    *   B) C3\n    *   C) D3h\n    *   D) C3v\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule A is the only one whose point group is exactly C3h.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Understand the C3h Point Group:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n    *   A principal axis of 3-fold rotation (a C3 axis).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   It must *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor any vertical mirror planes (σv). The full set of symmetry operations for C3h is {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule A: quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgeheads, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the N atom and the opposing bridgehead C-H group.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule C: triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure:** B(O-i-Pr)₃. A central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar. There is a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane passing through the boron atom.\n        *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they adopt a propeller-like conformation where all three groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation preserves the C3 axis but destroys any potential mirror planes. Specifically, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the sp³-hybridized carbons and their methyl groups are not symmetric with respect to the B(O)₃ plane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of the most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate is **C3**. (Note: The related molecule, boric acid B(OH)₃, is planar and does have C3h symmetry).\n\n4.  **Analyze Molecule D: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the systematic IUPAC name for **mellitic trianhydride**. The molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (at positions 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane are the requirements for C3h symmetry. However, we must check for additional symmetry elements.\n        *   There are also three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule (perpendicular to the C3 axis). Each C2 axis passes through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds in the central benzene ring (e.g., the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds).\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The addition of the σh plane makes the full point group **D3h**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group is **D3h**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Molecule B: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger analog of molecule D, based on a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Three anhydride groups are fused to the bay regions of the triphenylene system.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   Like molecule D, this molecule is planar.\n        *   The triphenylene core has D3h symmetry, and the symmetric fusion of the three anhydride groups preserves this symmetry.\n        *   It has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and three perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group is **D3h**.\n\n6.  **Final Evaluation:**\n    *   A) quinuclidine: **C3v**\n    *   B) triphenyleno...: **D3h**\n    *   C) triisopropyl borate: **C3**\n    *   D) benzo...: **D3h**\n\n    None of the molecules strictly belong to the C3h point group. This indicates a likely flaw in the question. However, in a multiple-choice context, we must identify the \"best\" answer.\n    Molecules with D3h symmetry (B and D) contain all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), plus additional elements (3C2, 3σv). It is a common mistake in introductory chemistry to identify the C3 axis and σh plane and assign the group as C3h, while overlooking the perpendicular C2 axes that make the group D3h. Given that both B and D are D3h, and D (mellitic trianhydride) is a more common textbook example of a high-symmetry molecule than B, it is the most plausible intended answer based on this common misconception.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n*   A **C3 axis**: A three-fold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting all atoms through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\nThe C3h point group also includes an S3 improper rotation axis, but the presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient for our identification.\n\n**2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\n*   **D) quinuclidine:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) with a cage-like structure.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen (N) atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (CH) atom. A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular (horizontal) to this C3 axis. Instead, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n*   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups. The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   **However**, it also possesses additional symmetry elements. There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C3 axis and the three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 point group family. With the addition of the σh plane, the full point group is **D3h**. While D3h symmetry includes the elements of C3h, it is a higher order symmetry group.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger, analogous molecule to (C), but with a triphenylene core instead of benzene. It is also a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule has a C3 axis, a σh plane (the molecular plane), and three perpendicular C2 axes within the plane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group for this molecule is also **D3h**.\n\n*   **B) triisopropyl borate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each attached to an isopropyl group. The central B(O)3 unit is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   Due to the bulky isopropyl groups, the molecule can adopt several conformations. Let's consider an idealized conformation that maximizes symmetry. If we imagine a plane containing the B, three O, and the three tertiary C atoms (of the isopropyl groups), this plane can act as a σh. For this to be a valid symmetry element, the two methyl groups on each isopropyl must be positioned symmetrically above and below this plane (one being the reflection of the other).\n        *   In this conformation, the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It does not have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any σv planes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This specific conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3h** point group. While its lowest-energy conformation may have lower (C3) symmetry due to steric twisting, it is the only molecule on the list whose highest plausible symmetry group is exactly C3h. In chemical point group questions, one typically looks for the molecule that *best fits* the specified group, not one that belongs to a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: **C3h** (in a symmetric conformation)\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3v\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the C3h Symmetry Point Group\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  **A principal C3 axis of rotation:** Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  **A horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This plane is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule across this plane leaves it unchanged.\n\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but the C3 and σh elements are the defining features to look for. Importantly, a molecule in the C3h point group does *not* have vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each of the four molecules provided.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Common Name:** Mellitic trianhydride.\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings. It is a planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes, since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane.\n    *   **Other elements:** The molecule also has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central benzene ring. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of the C2 axes and σv planes in addition to the C3 axis and σh plane means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it contains the elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, which are in turn bonded to isopropyl groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not rigid; the isopropyl groups can rotate. We need to consider its likely conformations.\n    *   The ground state conformation is a propeller-like shape, which is chiral and belongs to the C3 point group.\n    *   However, molecules can adopt different conformations. Let's consider a specific, idealized conformation. Imagine the B atom and the three O atoms lie in a plane. The C3 axis would be perpendicular to this plane. For a σh plane to exist, this plane must be a mirror plane.\n    *   This is possible in a specific arrangement: the B, O, the alpha-C of the isopropyl group, and its attached H all lie in the σh plane. For each isopropyl group, one of its two methyl (-CH3) groups lies above this plane, and the other lies below it.\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, rotating by 120° around the axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane maps each of the identically arranged isopropyl groups onto the next.\n    *   **σh plane:** Yes, the plane containing the B, O, C, and H atoms is a mirror plane, as it reflects the \"upper\" methyl group into the \"lower\" one for each of the three substituents.\n    *   **Other elements:** This conformation lacks any perpendicular C2 axes or vertical σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. This conformation is known to be the transition state for the racemization of its C3 ground state, but it is a valid structure with C3h symmetry.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a larger analogue of molecule A, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar molecule with D3h symmetry. Fusing three anhydride rings symmetrically onto this core maintains the planarity and high symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Similar to molecule A, this large, planar molecule has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a σh plane (the molecular plane itself).\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes in the plane and three σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a rigid, cage-like structure (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** Yes, there is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing C-H group.\n    *   **σh plane:** No, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would cut through the three ethylene bridges, and reflection would not result in an identical structure.\n    *   **Other elements:** The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes (but no σh) means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nLet's summarize the point groups:\n*   A) D3h\n*   B) C3 (ground state), but has a C3h conformation\n*   C) D3h\n*   D) C3v\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. In the context of such questions, we look for the molecule whose full symmetry is best and most accurately described by the C3h point group.\n*   Molecules A and C have D3h symmetry, which is a higher order group.\n*   Molecule D has C3v symmetry, which is a different group.\n*   Molecule B is the only one that can adopt a conformation with *exactly* C3h symmetry (and not a higher symmetry).\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nAnswering this question requires analyzing the three-dimensional structure of each molecule to determine its symmetry elements. The C3h point group is characterized by two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A threefold axis of rotation (C3): Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh): This is a plane of reflection that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**B) quinuclidine:**\n*   **Structure:** Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry:** It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H group). Rotating around this axis interchanges the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular (horizontal) to this C3 axis. A plane slicing through the middle of the ethylene bridges would not result in a reflection, as it would need to map the nitrogen atom onto the carbon bridgehead, which is impossible.\n*   **Conclusion:** Quinuclidine has C3v symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate:**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is attached to a bulky isopropyl group.\n*   **Symmetry:** While the B(O)3 core is trigonal planar, the bulky isopropyl groups cause significant steric hindrance. To minimize this repulsion, the isopropyl groups twist out of the BO3 plane, forming a propeller-like structure. If all groups twist in the same direction, the molecule has a C3 axis but loses the horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h. (A notable related molecule, boric acid B(OH)3, *does* have C3h symmetry because it is planar and the smaller H atoms are arranged appropriately, but the bulky isopropyl groups prevent this in triisopropyl borate).\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused with three anhydride-like rings. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry:** The fusion of rings onto the triphenylene core introduces significant steric strain. Large polycyclic aromatic systems like this are often forced to distort from planarity to relieve strain. A common distortion for molecules with potential D3h symmetry is to adopt a twisted, propeller-like shape (D3 symmetry) or a bowl shape (C3v symmetry). Both of these distortions preserve the C3 axis but destroy the horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to likely non-planarity from steric hindrance, this molecule is unlikely to possess a σh plane and therefore lacks C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry:** Despite the strain from fusing three five-membered rings to a six-membered ring, X-ray crystallography has confirmed that this molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, it has a σh plane and thus has C3h symmetry elements. (Its full point group is D3h, which is a higher symmetry group that contains all the symmetry elements of C3h).\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the only molecule among the choices that possesses the required C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Understanding C3h Symmetry\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  **A C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is superimposable on itself after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120°.\n2.  **A σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule is superimposable on itself after reflection through a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis (the C3 axis).\n\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but checking for C3 and σh is sufficient.\n\n### Analyzing the Molecules\n\nLet's examine each molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate, B(O-iPr)3**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (BO3). Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n*   **C3 Axis**: An axis passing through the boron atom and perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis will interchange the positions of the three -O-iPr groups. If the isopropyl groups all have the same conformation (e.g., all twisted like a propeller), this C3 symmetry is maintained.\n*   **σh Plane**: For a horizontal mirror plane to exist, it would have to be the same plane as the BO3 group. Reflection through this plane would require that for every atom at a certain distance 'z' above the plane, there is an identical atom at distance '-z' below the plane. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2, has a tetrahedral carbon atom and does not have this kind of internal mirror symmetry that could align with the BO3 plane. The lowest-energy conformation of this molecule is a propeller-like C3 structure, which is chiral and lacks any mirror planes.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**C) quinuclidine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane**\n*   **Structure**: A bicyclic amine with a highly symmetric cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen and a carbon atom at the bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **C3 Axis**: An axis passing through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C4) is a C3 axis. Rotation by 120° permutes the three ethylene bridges.\n*   **σh Plane**: A horizontal plane perpendicular to this C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the three ethylene bridges. Reflecting one half of the molecule (e.g., the part with the nitrogen) across this plane does not result in the other half (the part with the bridgehead carbon). For instance, the CH2 groups closest to the nitrogen are not equivalent to the CH2 groups closest to the carbon upon reflection. The molecule has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: Quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group, not C3h.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups [-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-] fused to its sides.\n*   **Idealized Symmetry**: If the molecule were perfectly planar, it would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the ring and the plane of the molecule would be a σh plane. The idealized symmetry would be D3h.\n*   **Actual Structure**: However, this molecule is known to be sterically strained. The carbonyl groups of adjacent anhydride rings are very close to each other, causing significant repulsion. This forces the anhydride rings to pucker out of the plane of the central benzene ring. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that the molecule is non-planar and has C2 symmetry in the solid state.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the actual molecule is non-planar and lacks a C3 axis, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a large, planar triphenylene core. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges of this core at positions that are symmetrically equivalent.\n*   **Idealized Symmetry**: Triphenylene itself is a highly symmetric planar molecule with D3h symmetry. The anhydride groups are attached far from each other, separated by benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n*   **Actual Structure**: Due to the large separation between the anhydride groups, there is negligible steric strain between them. The molecule is expected to be planar, or very close to planar.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule will possess D3h symmetry.

The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar and can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. Due to steric hindrance, the most stable conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation would possess a C₃ rotational axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)₃ plane.\n        *   However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms of the isopropyl groups (which are out of the B(O)₃ plane) across this plane does not result in an identical configuration.

This is sterically hindered and conformationally unfavorable. The sp3 hybridization at the alpha-carbons prevents the necessary planarity.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of this molecule is predicted to be a twisted, propeller-like structure belonging to the **C3** point group. This structure has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes.\n*   **Point Group**: The ground state conformation is likely **C3**.

A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they will twist out of the plane, creating a propeller-like structure.\n        *   This propeller conformation retains the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflecting the methyl groups of an isopropyl group through the B(O)3 plane does not result in an equivalent configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central benzene ring to which three maleic anhydride-like rings are symmetrically fused.

It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   Symmetry: Due to the free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule typically exists in a low-symmetry conformation. Even in a high-symmetry \"propeller-like\" conformation, the non-planar nature of the isopropyl groups prevents the existence of a horizontal mirror plane. The point group is most likely C3.

On each Cα, one methyl group points \"up\" (z > 0) and the other points \"down\" (z < 0).\n            *   This constructed conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n            *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. Does it have vertical mirror planes (σv)? A σv plane would have to contain the C3 axis and be a mirror plane for the molecule. For example, a plane containing a B-O bond. Because the B-O-C bond angle is not 180°, this plane does not contain the Cα atom, so it cannot be a mirror plane for the entire arm. Thus, this molecule lacks σv planes and perpendicular C2 axes.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that has exactly the C3 and σh symmetry elements (and the implied S3). Therefore, its point group is **C3h**. While this might not be the absolute lowest energy conformation (which is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape due to steric hindrance), it is a valid conformation that the molecule *can* have. Since the other three molecules are rigidly D3h, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer Check: Molecules A, B, and D have D3h symmetry. A D3h group contains the C3h group as a subgroup, but in these types of questions, the highest possible point group is used to classify the molecule. Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule on the list for which a plausible conformation has C3h as its highest point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group contains the following symmetry operations:\n1.  E (the identity operation)\n2.  C3 and C3^2 (rotations by 120° and 240° about a principal axis)\n3.  σh (a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis)\n4.  S3 and S3^5 (improper rotations)\n\nA molecule has C3h symmetry if its complete set of symmetry operations (its point group) is C3h. A molecule belonging to a higher symmetry group (like D3h) also contains the C3 and σh symmetry elements, but it is not typically described as \"having C3h symmetry\" in this context, as its full symmetry is not captured by the C3h point group. We will analyze the point group of each molecule.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to find a stable or representative conformation of this molecule. Due to some pi-bonding character between the oxygen lone pairs and the empty p-orbital on the boron, the B(O-C)3 skeleton tends to be planar or near-planar. A highly symmetric conformation can be envisioned:\n    1.  The Boron atom and the three Oxygen atoms lie in a plane. Let's define this as the horizontal plane (σh).\n    2.  A C3 axis passes through the Boron atom, perpendicular to this plane.\n    3.  For the plane to be a mirror plane (σh), the rest of the molecule must be symmetric with respect to reflection through it. This can be achieved if the three methine carbons (-**C**H(CH3)2) and their attached hydrogens (-C**H**(CH3)2) also lie within this plane.\n    4.  The methine carbon is sp3 hybridized. If the O, C, and H atoms lie in the plane, then the two methyl groups (-CH3) attached to this carbon must be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below it.\n    5.  If all three isopropyl groups adopt this orientation, arranged symmetrically around the C3 axis, the entire molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3h) or any vertical mirror planes σv (which would make it C3v). Therefore, the point group for this specific, highly symmetric conformation of triisopropyl borate is **C3h**. While the absolute lowest energy conformation might be slightly twisted into a C3 point group, the C3h conformation is a plausible and frequently considered structure.\n\n**B) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing C-H group on the other side of the cage.\n    2.  There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through the middle of one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    3.  There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). A plane halfway between the N and the opposing C-H would not be a mirror plane.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** A C3 axis and three σv planes define the **C3v** point group.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (mellitic trianhydride)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    2.  There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n    3.  There are also three C2 axes lying within the plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The additional presence of the σh plane makes the point group **D3h**. While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is D3h, not C3h.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** A planar molecule with a triphenylene core symmetrically fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. Symmetrically fusing the three anhydride rings preserves this symmetry.\n    1.  The molecule is planar, so it has a σh plane.\n    2.  It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    3.  It has three C2 axes in the plane.\n*   **Point Group Determination:** Similar to molecule C, the point group is **D3h**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   A) triisopropyl borate: **C3h** (in a symmetric conformation)\n*   B) quinuclidine: **C3v**\n*   C) mellitic trianhydride: **D3h**\n*   D) triphenylene derivative: **D3h**\n\nOnly triisopropyl borate has a point group of C3h. The other molecules either have a different point group (C3v) or a higher symmetry point group that contains C3h as a subgroup (D3h). In questions of this type, we select the molecule for which the specified group represents the complete point group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n1.  **Analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine its point group.**\n\n    *   **Quinuclidine (A):** The IUPAC name is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

Let's find its structure. A search reveals this molecule is known as Substituted Hexaoxotriphenylene, or HATNA-mel. The core is a triphenylene, and three furan-dione rings are fused to it, maintaining the overall D3h symmetry of triphenylene if we consider the arrangement of the furan rings. However, the furan rings themselves break this symmetry. Let's look closer.\n        *   The molecule is likely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the central ring.\n        *   It does not appear to have C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the anhydride groups (furan-dione) are not symmetrical with respect to reflection through the plane of the central benzene ring; the oxygen atoms are not symmetrically placed. For instance, the furan oxygens are on one side of the fused bond, and the carbonyl groups are on the other.\n        *   It also lacks vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Therefore, the only symmetry element, besides identity (E), is the C3 axis. The point group is **C3**.\n\n    *   **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C):** This molecule is a mellitic anhydride derivative, also known as Benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride.\n        *   The molecule is planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   There is a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane defines the **C3h** point group. The other symmetry element implied by these two is an S3 improper rotation axis, which is coincident with the C3 axis.\n\n    *   **Triisopropyl borate (D):** The chemical formula is B(O-i-Pr)3. The structure consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups, B(OCH(CH3)2)3.\n        *   The core B(O)3 part is planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, the isopropyl groups, -CH(CH3)2, are not planar and introduce chirality at the CH carbon.\n        *   Due to steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups will twist out of the B(O)3 plane in a propeller-like fashion to minimize repulsion. This conformation destroys any mirror planes (both σh and σv).\n        *   The resulting stable conformation possesses a C3 axis but no other symmetry elements (besides identity). Thus, its point group is **C3**.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   Quinuclidine: C3v\n    *   Triphenyleno[...]: C3\n    *   Benzo[...]trifuran-hexaone: **C3h**\n    *   Triisopropyl borate: C3\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group requires a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (B)**\n    *   Structure: Also known as 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis: There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite carbon atom (C4) with its hydrogen. The molecule can be rotated by 120° around this axis and remain unchanged. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Point Group: C3v. Since it lacks a σh plane, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   Structure: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to alternating sides.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis: The molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Therefore, it possesses the elements required for C3h symmetry.\n        *   However, we must identify the *highest* point group. In addition to C3 and σh, this molecule has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central ring. The presence of these perpendicular C2 axes makes the full point group D3h.\n    *   Point Group: D3h.\n\n3.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is larger than benzene but also highly symmetric. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to this core.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis: Like mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a triphenylene core which has D3h symmetry.\n        *   The three anhydride groups are attached in a way that preserves the symmetry.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a σh plane (the molecular plane), and three perpendicular C2 axes in the plane.\n    *   Point Group: D3h.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**\n    *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement (BO3 core). Each oxygen atom is bonded to an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2.\n    *   Symmetry Analysis:\n        *   A C3 axis can be drawn perpendicular to the BO3 plane, passing through the boron atom.\n        *   For the molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must possess a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis. This plane would coincide with the plane of the three oxygen atoms and the central boron atom.\n        *   For the BO3 plane to be a mirror plane, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it. This requires a specific conformation where, for each isopropyl group, the C-H bond of the central carbon lies within the mirror plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned one above and one below the plane, as reflections of each other. While this conformation might be sterically strained compared to the more likely C3 \"propeller\" conformation, it is a possible conformation that possesses a σh plane.\n        *   Does this molecule have perpendicular C2 axes like the D3h molecules? No. The bulky, asymmetric nature of the isopropyl groups prevents the existence of C2 axes lying in the BO3 plane. For example, an axis passing through the B atom and one of the O atoms is not a C2 axis because rotating the attached isopropyl group by 180° does not leave it unchanged.\n    *   Point Group: The most stable conformation is likely C3. However, an idealized conformation exists with C3h symmetry. Crucially, its highest possible point group is C3h, not D3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule B (quinuclidine) is C3v.\n*   Molecules A and D are D3h. While the D3h point group contains all the symmetry operations of its C3h subgroup, a molecule belongs to only one point group, which is the one that describes *all* its symmetries. So, molecules A and D belong to the D3h point group, not the C3h point group.\n*   Molecule C (triisopropyl borate) is the only one whose highest possible point group is C3h. Questions of this type usually refer to the full point group of the molecule, often assuming an idealized high-symmetry conformation.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n1.  **Analyze the symmetry elements required for the C3h point group.** The C3h point group requires two main symmetry elements:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120 degrees).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    The presence of these two elements automatically generates a center of inversion (i) and an S3 improper rotation axis. The key features are the three-fold rotational symmetry and the horizontal mirror plane.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) Triisopropyl borate:**\n        *   **Structure:** B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each connected to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar, suggesting a potential C3 axis perpendicular to this plane. However, the isopropyl groups are bulky and not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they will likely adopt a propeller-like conformation, twisting out of the B(O)3 plane. In such a conformation, the molecule could possess a C3 axis if all groups twist in the same direction. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) that would bisect all the isopropyl groups. The methyl groups and hydrogens of the isopropyls are not mirrored across the B(O)3 plane. Therefore, triisopropyl borate does not have C3h symmetry. Its point group is likely C3 or lower depending on the conformation.\n\n    *   **B) Quinuclidine:**\n        *   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (and its hydrogen). Rotation by 120 degrees around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges. The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have the required horizontal mirror plane (σh) for C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a planar molecule based on a central benzene ring. Three maleic anhydride-like groups are fused to the benzene ring. The molecule's chemical name can be simplified to \"benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride\".\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** As a planar molecule, its principal axis of symmetry (if any) must be perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   Looking at the structure, we can identify a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 120-degree rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n        *   Since the entire molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane confirms that the molecule belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is based on a triphenylene core (four fused benzene rings). Three maleic anhydride-like groups are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene core. The molecule is not planar due to steric hindrance between the anhydride groups, forcing it into a helical or propeller-like shape.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Due to its propeller shape, the molecule is chiral and lacks any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i). It does possess a C3 axis of rotation down the center of the molecule. Since it only has a C3 axis and no other symmetry elements (besides the trivial C1), its point group is **C3**. It lacks the σh plane required for C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.** Based on the analysis, only benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone possesses both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which are the defining elements of the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Analyze the C3h point group.**\n    A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis (the C3 axis).\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine** (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):\n        *   This is a cage-like bicyclic amine.\n        *   It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting the top half of the molecule (with the nitrogen) across a central plane does not produce the bottom half (with the carbon).\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine lacks a σh plane. Its actual point group is C3v. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone** (mellitic anhydride):\n        *   This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused symmetrically with three anhydride rings.\n        *   The molecule is planar.\n        *   It possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Thus, it has the elements of C3h symmetry. In fact, its full point group is D3h because it also has three C2 axes in the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv). Since D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, this molecule *has* C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**:\n        *   This is a larger analog of molecule A, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core.\n        *   Like A, this molecule is planar and highly symmetric.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a σh plane (the molecular plane).\n        *   Its full point group is also D3h. Like molecule A, it *has* C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **D) triisopropyl borate** (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):\n        *   The molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is planar.\n        *   Due to significant steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, they cannot lie flat in the same plane. They twist out of the plane in a propeller-like fashion.\n        *   This propeller structure has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   However, because of the twist, the molecule is not planar, and there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The ground state conformation belongs to the C3 point group.\n        *   Therefore, in its lowest energy state, triisopropyl borate does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the candidates.**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the ground-state structures, both molecules A and B have D3h symmetry, which includes the C3 axis and σh plane required for C3h. Molecules C and D lack the required σh plane.\n    *   A multiple-choice question should ideally have only one correct answer. The fact that both A and B are D3h molecules (and thus possess C3h symmetry elements) suggests there might be a more subtle interpretation.\n    *   Often, chemistry questions about point groups might ask for a molecule whose point group is *exactly* the one specified, not a higher-symmetry supergroup.\n    *   If the question implies \"the point group is exactly C3h\", then A and B (being D3h) would be incorrect. C (C3v) and D (C3) would also be incorrect based on their ground states. This suggests another interpretation is needed.\n    *   Let's consider an idealized or time-averaged structure for triisopropyl borate. For simpler boric acid esters like trimethyl borate (B(OCH3)3), the point group is indeed C3h. It's possible the question uses triisopropyl borate as a representative of the B(OR)3 class and expects an idealized C3h structure, where the propeller twist due to sterics is ignored. In this idealized planar model (without the additional symmetries that would raise it to D3h), triisopropyl borate would be the only molecule belonging specifically to the C3h point group. This type of simplification is common in educational contexts to test the concept. Another interpretation is that the rapid rotation of the C-O bonds at room temperature creates a time-averaged structure that has effective C3h symmetry.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Given that A and B are both highly symmetric D3h molecules and C and D have lower C3v and C3 symmetry respectively, the most likely intended answer hinges on an interpretation that distinguishes a single option. The idealization of triisopropyl borate's structure to C3h (similar to its less-hindered analog, trimethyl borate) provides a unique answer, distinguishing it from the D3h and C3v molecules. Under this common pedagogical simplification, triisopropyl borate is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group consists of the following symmetry operations:\n*   An identity element (E)\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C3)\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis\n*   The improper rotation axis S3, which results from the combination of C3 and σh.\n\nA key feature of the C3h point group is the presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, but the *absence* of vertical mirror planes (σv) and C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically onto the outer edges of the triphenylene system.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** Assuming the resulting molecule is planar (which is highly likely), its symmetry will be the same as the decorated core.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule is a σh plane.\n        *   It will also have C2 axes in the plane and σv planes containing the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. Each oxygen is attached to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:** The molecule is not planar due to the sp3-hybridized methine carbons of the isopropyl groups. Let's consider a stable conformation.\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. This is due to the three identical -O-iPr groups arranged symmetrically around the boron.\n        *   Now let's check for a σh plane. A plausible low-energy conformation places the central BO3 unit, along with the three methine carbons (the 'C' of the -CH(CH3)2) and their attached hydrogens ('H'), all in a single plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to work, for each isopropyl group, one of its two methyl (-CH3) groups must be located above this plane, and the other must be located an equal distance below it. Reflection through the plane would swap these two methyl groups. This conformation is energetically reasonable.\n        *   Now, we must check for vertical mirror planes (σv). A σv plane must contain the C3 axis. Due to the propeller-like twist of the isopropyl groups (necessary to place the C-H bonds in the plane), no such plane exists. Reflecting across a vertical plane does not map the molecule onto itself.\n    *   **Point Group:** Since the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but lacks σv planes, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3h\n*   Molecule C: C3v\n*   Molecule D: D3h\n\nThe only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThis question asks to identify which of the four given molecules has C3h symmetry. To solve this, we need to determine the point group of each molecule by analyzing its symmetry elements.\n\nA point group is a collection of symmetry operations that leave a molecule unchanged. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. The presence of these two elements also implies the existence of a three-fold improper rotation axis (S3).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **quinuclidine (B)**: This is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged. It also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis because reflecting through such a plane would not map the nitrogen end of the molecule onto the carbon end.\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes puts quinuclidine in the **C3v** point group.\n\n2.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**: This is a complex IUPAC name for a well-known molecule, **mellitic trianhydride**.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: This molecule is completely planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In addition to the C3 axis, it has three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane.\n    *   **Point Group**: A molecule with a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane belongs to the **D3h** point group. While it does contain the C3 and σh elements, its overall symmetry is higher than C3h.\n\n3.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**: This is another large, planar molecule, a trianhydride derivative of triphenylene.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar. It possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to its plane, three C2 axes in the plane, and the molecular plane is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: Its symmetry is also **D3h**.\n\n4.  **triisopropyl borate (D)**: The chemical formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3.\n    *   **Symmetry elements**: The central B(O)3 core is planar. To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups adopt a propeller-like conformation. The lowest-energy conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. For each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2], the central carbon and its attached hydrogen lie in the B(O)3 plane, while the two methyl (CH3) groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below this plane. This B(O)3 plane thus acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule does not have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis or any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group**: With a C3 axis and a σh plane (and no other higher-order elements like perpendicular C2 axes), this molecule belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3v\n*   Molecule C: D3h\n*   Molecule D: C3h\n\nThe only molecule whose point group is C3h is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Understand C3h Symmetry**\n    A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    The C3h point group consists of the symmetry operations: E (identity), C3 (120° rotation), C3^2 (240° rotation), σh (reflection in the horizontal plane), S3 (improper rotation of 120°), and S3^5 (improper rotation of 600°). A key feature is the presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular mirror plane, and the *absence* of perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n    *   **D) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n        *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and three O atoms form a trigonal planar core (or close to it).\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule can adopt a \"propeller-like\" conformation to minimize steric hindrance, where the three isopropoxy groups are twisted in the same direction. This conformation gives the molecule a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar and do not have a plane of symmetry that could coincide with the B(O)3 plane. Reflecting the molecule through this plane would not result in an identical structure.\n        *   **Point Group:** Most likely C3. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n        *   **Structure:** A cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. Rotation by 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and pass through the center of one of the ethylene bridges. The molecule does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   **Point Group:** C3v. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (also known as Mellitic trianhydride)**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central benzene ring to which three five-membered anhydride rings are fused at the 1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6- positions.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n            *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself can act as a mirror plane.\n            *   There is a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule invariant.\n            *   Since the C3 axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane (which is a mirror plane), the molecule has a σh plane.\n            *   The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane confirms it has at least C3h symmetry.\n            *   We must check for other symmetry elements. Are there three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3h)? No. An axis passing through the center of the molecule and lying in the plane would not leave the molecule unchanged upon a 180° rotation due to the arrangement of the anhydride rings.\n        *   **Point Group:** C3h. This molecule perfectly fits the C3h point group.\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a larger version of molecule C, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings. The three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically into the \"bays\" of the triphenylene system.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n            *   The molecule is planar, so it has a σh plane.\n            *   It retains the C3 axis from the triphenylene core, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n            *   Unlike molecule C, the parent triphenylene molecule (and this derivative) also possesses three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   **Point Group:** D3h. A molecule with D3h symmetry has all the symmetry elements of C3h (C3 axis and σh plane), but it belongs to a higher symmetry group because of the additional C2 axes. In the context of a multiple-choice question asking to identify a molecule with a specific point group, one usually looks for the molecule for which that group is the *complete and correct* assignment.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Molecule A has D3h symmetry.\n    *   Molecule B has C3v symmetry.\n    *   Molecule C has C3h symmetry.\n    *   Molecule D has C3 symmetry.\n\nThe only molecule whose point group is precisely C3h is `benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given molecules belongs to the C3h point group.\n\n2.  **Define C3h symmetry:** A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses:\n    *   A principal C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The combination of these two operations (C3 followed by σh) generates an S3 improper rotation axis. The presence of C3 and σh automatically implies the presence of S3. The C3h point group consists of the elements E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, and S3^5.\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine:** The structure is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.\n        *   **Symmetry elements:** It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the N-C-C-H bridges.\n        *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group D3. The addition of the three σv planes makes the point group **D3h**. Quinuclidine does not have a σh plane perpendicular to the main C3 axis.\n\n    *   **D) triisopropyl borate:** The formula is B(O-iPr)3 or B(OCH(CH3)2)3.\n        *   **Structure:** The central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and the B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. The C3 axis is perpendicular to this plane and passes through the boron atom.\n        *   **Symmetry elements:** The three isopropoxy groups are arranged in a propeller-like fashion around the boron atom. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the B(O)3 core because the isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2] are not planar and do not have mirror symmetry across such a plane.\n        *   **Point Group:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3 symmetry**.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, disc-shaped molecule formed by fusing a triphenylene core with three maleic anhydride-type furan rings.\n        *   **Symmetry elements:** The molecule is planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. It also has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   **Point Group:** Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule is a σh plane. The presence of a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane would suggest a C3h point group. However, the presence of the three C2 axes makes the principal group D3. With the σh plane, the point group becomes **D3h**.\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride.\n        *   **Structure:** It consists of a central benzene ring to which three maleic anhydride-type furan rings are fused.\n        *   **Symmetry elements:**\n            *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n            *   The molecule is not perfectly planar due to some puckering of the five-membered rings, but it possesses a \"pseudo-planar\" structure.

The three anhydride groups are rotated relative to each other by 120°.\n            *   There is a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that lies in the plane of the central benzene ring. Each oxygen atom of the C=O groups above the plane is mirrored by a bridging ether oxygen below the plane, and vice-versa, when viewed from a conformation that highlights this symmetry. However, the accepted ground-state structure and the point group assignment in the literature confirm that a σh plane is present.\n            *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. Trying to perform a 180° rotation around an axis passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the benzene ring does not leave the molecule unchanged.\n        *   **Point Group:** The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, but lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two key symmetry elements:\n1.

Analyze Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule provided.\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n\nThis complex IUPAC name can be interpreted in two main ways, leading to two different common molecules:\n\n1.  **Mellitic Trianhydride (aromatic core)**: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups. The chemical formula is C12O9. The entire molecule is an extended aromatic system and is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry analysis**:\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of C2 axes and σv planes in addition to C3 and σh means the full point group is **D3h**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexacarboxylic 1,2:3,4:5,6-trianhydride (saturated core)**: This molecule has a central cyclohexane ring in a chair conformation, with three anhydride rings fused to it. The chemical formula is C12H6O6.\n    *   **Symmetry analysis**:\n        *   The chair conformation has a C3 axis passing through the center of the ring.\n        *   However, due to the puckered nature of the ring and the arrangement of the anhydride groups, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The point group of this molecule is **C3**.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n\nThis molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar.\n\n*   **Symmetry analysis**:\n    *   Due to steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, the groups twist out of the BO3 plane, forming a \"propeller\" shape.\n    *   This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   However, this twisting breaks the horizontal mirror plane symmetry (σh).\n*   **Conclusion**: The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3** symmetry. An idealized planar structure would have D3h symmetry, and the C3h structure represents a transition state between propeller conformations, not the ground state.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\nThis is a large, disc-like molecule based on a triphenylene core.\n\n*   **Symmetry analysis**:\n    *   Similar to triisopropyl borate, steric repulsion between the anhydride groups forces the molecule to adopt a non-planar, propeller-like shape.\n    *   This conformation possesses a C3 axis.\n    *   It lacks a σh plane. A hypothetical, perfectly planar version would have D3h symmetry, but this is not the ground state structure.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group of this molecule's stable conformation is **C3**.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\nThis is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n\n*   **Symmetry analysis**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H group).\n    *   It has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n### 3.

However, in chemistry questions, \"has X symmetry\" can sometimes mean that the molecule's full symmetry point group is a supergroup of X (i.e., it contains all the symmetry operations of X).\n\nLet's review the point groups again:\n*   **C3h**: Contains {C3, σh}\n*   **D3h**: Contains {C3, σh, 3C2, 3σv} -> Contains C3h\n*   **C3**: Contains {C3} -> Does not contain σh\n*   **C3v**: Contains {C3, 3σv} -> Does not contain σh\n\nOnly the D3h point group contains all the symmetry elements of C3h. The most plausible candidate for a D3h molecule among the choices is molecule A, interpreted as the well-known planar molecule **mellitic trianhydride**. Its stable ground state is indeed D3h. The other options have stable conformations with C3 or C3v symmetry, neither of which includes the σh plane required for C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, assuming the question allows for a supergroup and that molecule A refers to mellitic trianhydride, it is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n1.  **Analyze the request:** The user wants to identify which of the four given molecules possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Define C3h symmetry:** A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n    *   A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis), meaning a 120° rotation about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of C3 and σh automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n        *   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Symmetry:** While a C3 axis can be imagined passing through the boron atom and perpendicular to the B-O plane, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) introduce complexity. Due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule likely exists in a low-symmetry conformation at room temperature. Even in a highly symmetric, propeller-like conformation, it would have C3 symmetry, but not a horizontal mirror plane (σh) due to the positions of the methyl groups above and below any potential plane. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a large, complex, planar aromatic system. Triphenylene is a D3h molecule. Fusing three furan-dione rings (maleic anhydride derivatives) to the outer rings of triphenylene in a symmetrical fashion maintains a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry:**\n            *   **C3 axis:** The molecule has a clear three-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passing through its center. A 120° rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n            *   **σh plane:** The entire molecule is planar. Therefore, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, its point group is C3h.\n\n    *   **C) quinuclidine:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   **Symmetry:**\n            *   **C3 axis:** There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (C-H).\n            *   **Mirror Planes:** There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene bridges (-CH2-CH2-).\n            *   **σh plane:** There is no horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n            *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places quinuclidine in the C3v point group.\n\n    *   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule is an anhydride of mellitic acid, also known as mellitic anhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three furan-dione rings.\n        *   **Symmetry:**\n            *   **C3 axis:** A C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n            *   **σh plane:** The molecule is planar, so the molecular plane acts as a σh plane.\n            *   **Conclusion:** Similar to molecule B, this molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane. Its point group is C3h.\n\n4.  **Review the options:** Both molecule B and molecule D have C3h symmetry. Let's re-read the question. It asks \"which of the following molecules has c3h symmetry?\", implying there might be only one correct choice among the options provided. It's possible there's an error in the question design, as two molecules fit the description. However, typically in multiple-choice questions, we select the answer provided. Since both B and D are valid answers and both are listed, there might be an issue with the question itself. But if forced to choose from the given options, both B and D are chemically correct examples of C3h symmetry. Let's assume the question is valid and select one of the correct options. Both B and D are correct.\n\nLet's assume there is only one correct answer expected from the list. Let's just output B as it is a valid answer.\nIf this were a test, I would flag the question. But for this task, I will provide one of the correct answers.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A - Triisopropyl borate: No C3h.\n*   B - triphenyleno[...]hexaone: Yes, C3h.\n*   C - Quinuclidine: No, C3v.\n*   D - benzo[...]hexaone: Yes, C3h.\n\nBoth B and D are correct. Let's present B as the answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group. The C3h point group requires a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It must not have higher symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv) that would place it in a group like D3h or D3d.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (B)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead. These are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the carbon of the opposing CH group. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and bisect one of the ethylene bridges. The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n2.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This complex name corresponds to **mellitic trianhydride**. The molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is planar. There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). In addition, there are three C2 axes that lie within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of the C-C bonds of the central benzene ring. The combination of a C3 axis, a perpendicular σh, and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of molecule D, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. It is also a planar molecule with three anhydride groups fused in a symmetrical fashion.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Similar to molecule D, this molecule is planar. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to its plane. The molecular plane is a σh plane. It also possesses three C2 axes within the plane. Therefore, this molecule also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n4.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**:\n    *   **Structure**: The chemical formula is B(O-CH(CH3)2)3. The boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, which are in turn bonded to isopropyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Let's consider an idealized conformation to analyze the symmetry. The BO3 core is trigonal planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. For the molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh), this plane must contain the B and O atoms. Furthermore, each isopropyl group must be bisected by this plane. This is possible if, for each group, the central carbon atom and its attached hydrogen atom lie within the plane, while the two methyl (-CH3) groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. If all three isopropyl groups adopt this specific, symmetric orientation, the molecule as a whole will have a σh plane. This conformation possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any σv planes containing the C3 axis. Thus, this idealized conformation of triisopropyl borate belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n*   Molecule A: D3h\n*   Molecule B: C3v\n*   Molecule C: C3h (in an idealized conformation)\n*   Molecule D: D3h\n\nMolecules A and D belong to the higher symmetry group D3h. Molecule B belongs to the C3v group. Molecule C is the only one that can be represented by a plausible structure belonging specifically to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry among the given options. Let's analyze the point group of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (C3 axis): The molecule is unchanged after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh): A mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\nThe presence of these two elements automatically implies the presence of a third element, an improper rotation axis S3. A molecule belonging to the C3h point group should not possess any higher symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\nThis is a complex IUPAC name for a well-known molecule, **mellitic trianhydride** (C12O9).\n*   **Structure**: It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Additionally, there are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n    *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of the C3 axis, the perpendicular C2 axes, and the σh plane makes the point group **D3h**. Since D3h is a higher symmetry group than C3h, this is not the best answer. While it possesses the elements of C3h, its full symmetry is D3h.\n\n**B) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The point group is **C3v**.\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a triphenylene core with three anhydride-like rings fused to its outer \"bay\" regions.\n*   **Symmetry**: The triphenylene core itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, fusing the three large anhydride groups at these positions introduces severe steric hindrance. To relieve this strain, the molecule cannot be planar. It twists into a propeller-like (helicoidal) shape.\n    *   This twisting preserves the C3 rotational axis perpendicular to the average plane of the molecule.\n    *   However, the twisting destroys all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and the in-plane C2 axes.\n*   **Point Group**: The resulting point group is **C3**.\n\n**D) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group -CH(CH3)2. It consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n*   **Symmetry**: The analysis is analogous to that of boric acid, B(OH)3, which is the classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n    *   Let's assume the B atom and the three O atoms lie in a single plane. This plane can act as the horizontal mirror plane (σh). A C3 axis would be perpendicular to this plane, passing through the B atom. This B(O)3 core has D3h symmetry.\n    *   Now, we consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2]. Due to the presence of the bulky methyl groups, they will adopt a specific orientation. A plausible, low-energy conformation is one where the three isopropyl groups are arranged in a propeller-like fashion.\n    *   For example, if the C-H bond of each isopropyl group is oriented in a way that is canted relative to the B-O bond, and this arrangement is repeated for all three groups by the C3 rotation, the D3h symmetry of the core is broken.\n    *   Specifically, this canted arrangement destroys the C2 axes and the σv planes.\n    *   However, it is possible to have a conformation that retains both the C3 axis and the σh plane. Imagine the B, O, and the methine C atoms all lying in the σh plane. At each methine C, one H atom is also in the plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane. This structure maintains the σh plane (which reflects one CH3 into the other) and the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: This conformation has **C3h** symmetry. It lacks the C2 axes and σv planes, so its point group is not D3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Molecule A has D3h symmetry.\n- Molecule B has C3v symmetry.\n- Molecule C has C3 symmetry.\n- Molecule D can adopt a stable conformation that has C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis question asks to identify which of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two essential symmetry elements:\n1.

A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nA molecule with C3h symmetry must not have higher symmetry, such as three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3 or D3h) or vertical mirror planes (which would make it C3v).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

The molecule can be rotated by 120° about this axis and remain unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**. This is not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, planar aromatic molecule.

The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group at least D3.\n*   **Point Group**: Combining the D3 elements with the horizontal mirror plane (σh) results in the **D3h** point group. This is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the common chemical mellitic trianhydride.

We need to consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups. While the lowest energy conformation is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a higher-symmetry conformation.\n    *   Consider a conformation where the B and the three O atoms lie in a plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to be true, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to this plane.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon (C_a) and the hydrogen attached to it (C_a-H) also lie in the B-O plane, with the two methyl groups (-CH3) positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   In this specific conformation, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The plane containing the B, O, C_a, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Crucially, this conformation does *not* have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane, with no other symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformer, it is a possible conformation, and this molecule is the only one among the options whose point group can be exactly C3h.

The plane of the molecule is a **σh** plane.\n    *   It has a **C3** axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center.\n    *   Due to the high symmetry of the triphenylene core and the symmetric placement of the fused rings, it also has three **C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9).

These C2 axes pass through the midpoints of the C-C bonds of the benzene ring that are *not* part of the anhydride fusions (i.e., the C2-C3, C4-C5, and C6-C1 bonds). Rotating by 180 degrees around one of these axes maps the molecule onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion**: Like molecule B, this molecule's point group is **D3h**.\n\n**Note on D3h vs. C3h**: A question asking \"which molecule has C3h symmetry?\" is best interpreted as \"which molecule's point group *is* C3h?\". Molecules with D3h symmetry contain the symmetry elements of C3h, but their full symmetry is described by the D3h group, not the C3h subgroup. Since two options (B and D) are D3h, and one (A) is C3v, the answer must be C.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2). The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: This case requires considering different possible conformations. A common analogy is made with boric acid, B(OH)3.\n    *   Boric acid, B(OH)3, is planar and has a C3 axis. While a high-symmetry D3h conformation exists, the commonly cited point group is **C3h**. This is because a lower-energy conformation involves a slight propeller-like twist of the O-H bonds within the molecular plane. This twist preserves the C3 axis and the σh plane (the plane of the molecule) but destroys the perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   We can apply the same reasoning to triisopropyl borate. We consider a conformation where the bulky isopropyl groups are treated as discs. The molecule can be arranged with a planar B-O3 core, providing a **σh** plane and a **C3** axis.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will adopt a propeller-like arrangement. This \"twist\" breaks the C2 symmetry that would pass through the B-O bonds.\n    *   Therefore, this conformation lacks perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes but retains the C3 axis and the σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation belonging to the **C3h** point group.

An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane passing through the center. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Due to its high symmetry, it also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. The presence of these C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. Boron is typically trigonal planar (sp2 hybridized). To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule adopts a specific low-energy conformation.\n*   **Conformation for C3h symmetry:** Let's consider a conformation where the B atom, the three O atoms, the three adjacent C atoms, and their attached H atoms (from the -CH moiety) all lie in a single plane. For each isopropyl group, the two methyl (-CH3) groups are arranged symmetrically, one above this plane and one below.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to this plane, passing through the central Boron atom. A 120° rotation maps each isopropoxy group onto the next one.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane containing the B, O, C, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane. Reflecting through this plane swaps the \"top\" methyl group with the \"bottom\" methyl group for each of the three isopropyl substituents, leaving the overall molecule unchanged.\n*   **Other elements?** No. There are no vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. For instance, a 180° rotation around an axis passing through one of the B-O bonds would not map the other two isopropyl groups onto each other.\n*   Therefore, this molecule, in its stable conformation, belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**C) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a C-H group at the other.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. The axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n*   **σh plane?** No. A horizontal plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the C-C bonds connecting the two ends. Reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the position of the carbon atom, which are different. Thus, there is no σh.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes (and the absence of σh) means quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as Mellitic Anhydride. It's a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. Perpendicular to the molecular plane through the center of the benzene ring.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Like molecule A, it has three C2 axes in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has a stable conformation that belongs to the C3h point group.

I will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine its point group.\n\n**Analysis of each molecule's symmetry:**\n\n1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n    *   The central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. This suggests a principal C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are bulky. Due to steric hindrance, they will likely adopt a propeller-like conformation. In this conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis.\n    *   However, for C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis is required. Such a plane would have to contain the Boron and the three Oxygen atoms. The isopropyl groups, with their out-of-plane methyl groups and hydrogens, would need to be reflected through this plane. This is not possible; the molecule lacks a σh plane. The most likely point group due to the propeller arrangement is C3.\n\n2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with the nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n    *   There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis results in an indistinguishable conformation.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three -(CH2)2- bridges.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It does not have C3h symmetry as it lacks the required horizontal mirror plane.\n\n3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride.\n    *   The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   It has a central C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   It also has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   Any planar molecule with a Cn axis (n>1) perpendicular to the plane must have a σh plane and thus belongs to the Cnh point group.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule possesses **C3h** symmetry. The symmetry elements are the identity (E), the C3 axis, and the σh plane, which together generate the S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is an anhydride derived from triphenylene. It is structurally related to the mellitic trianhydride but based on a larger, non-planar triphenylene core.\n    *   Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, the fusion of the anhydride groups puckers the structure. The outer benzene rings are twisted out of the plane of the central ring, creating a propeller-like, helical shape.\n    *   This helical structure possesses a C3 axis of rotation through the center of the molecule.\n    *   However, because of the twisting, it lacks any mirror planes (neither σh nor σv). It also lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   A molecule with only a Cn axis belongs to the Cn point group. Therefore, this molecule has **C3** symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the only molecule in the list that possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecules**\n\n    To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group is characterized by having a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n    1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-OCH(CH3)2). The B and the three O atoms form a trigonal planar B(O)3 core.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. The molecule's symmetry depends on the conformation of the three isopropyl groups, which can rotate around the B-O bonds.\n        *   A specific, stable conformation exists where the molecule possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is coincident with the B(O)3 plane. In this conformation, for each isopropyl group, the central C-H bond lies within the σh plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane.\n        *   This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks vertical mirror planes and C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Therefore, triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. This is a classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n\n    2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, specifically 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that pass through the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n    3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the systematic name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar. The C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Additionally, there are three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule, and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Because it has C3, σh, C2 (perpendicular), and σv elements, the point group is **D3h**. While a D3h molecule contains the elements of C3h symmetry, its overall point group is higher.\n\n    4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a larger analog of mellitic trianhydride, based on a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar, highly symmetric molecule (D3h). The addition of three symmetric anhydride groups maintains the high symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this large molecule is expected to be planar. It will possess a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), perpendicular C2 axes, and vertical mirror planes. Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups:\n    *   A: D3h\n    *   B: C3h (in a stable conformation)\n    *   C: C3v\n    *   D: D3h\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Typically, this refers to the molecule whose point group is C3h. Only triisopropyl borate fits this description. The molecules with D3h symmetry have a higher level of symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n1.  **Understand the C3h Point Group:**\n    A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following principal symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C3 axis**: A three-fold axis of rotational symmetry. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n    *   A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Molecule:**\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n        *   This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure, also known as 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.\n        *   Imagine the axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon (a CH group). Looking down this axis, the molecule's three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges are arranged symmetrically. A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged, so it has a **C3 axis**.\n        *   However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to cut through the middle of the three ethylene bridges. The part of the molecule near the nitrogen is not a mirror image of the part near the bridgehead carbon.\n        *   Quinuclidine has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, its point group is **C3v**, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3):**\n        *   The molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-OCH(CH3)2). The BO3 core is trigonal planar.\n        *   This molecule is flexible due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n        *   In the gas phase, it can adopt a low-energy conformation with a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the BO3 plane, creating a propeller-like structure.\n        *   For a **σh plane** to exist, the molecule must have mirror symmetry across the plane containing the B and O atoms. This is possible if for each isopropyl group, the Cα-H bond lies in the plane, and the two methyl groups are arranged symmetrically above and below the plane. Studies have shown that triisopropyl borate does adopt a **C3h** conformation. However, this symmetry applies to a specific conformer and not a rigid skeleton.\n\n    *   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   This is a large, planar molecule. Its core is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made of four fused benzene rings. The triphenylene core itself has high symmetry, belonging to the D3h point group.\n        *   Three cyclic anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges of the triphenylene core at equivalent positions. This preserves the high symmetry of the core.\n        *   The molecule has a **C3 axis** through its center, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   Since the molecule is planar, the molecular plane itself acts as a **σh plane**.\n        *   In addition to C3 and σh, it also possesses three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Therefore, the full point group of this molecule is **D3h**. A molecule with D3h symmetry contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3h is a subgroup of D3h). So, this molecule *does* have C3h symmetry, but its symmetry is higher.\n\n    *   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three cyclic anhydride groups fused to alternating sides (at positions 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6).\n        *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule is therefore a **σh plane**.\n        *   There is a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring. A 120° rotation maps the three anhydride rings onto each other.\n        *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. Unlike molecule A, there are no C2 axes lying in the molecular plane. For instance, rotating by 180° around an axis passing through the C2-C3 bond does not leave the molecule invariant because it would map the anhydride ring at the C5-C6 position onto the C2-C3 bond, where there is no anhydride. Similarly, there are no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   The only symmetry elements are those of the C3h group (E, C3, C3^2, σh, S3, S3^5). Therefore, the point group of this molecule is exactly **C3h**. While it was historically thought to be D3h, modern computational and spectroscopic studies have confirmed its C3h symmetry.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    We need to select the molecule that \"has C3h symmetry\".\n    *   Molecule D (Quinuclidine) is C3v, so it is incorrect.\n    *   Molecule A (Triphenylene derivative) has D3h symmetry. It has the elements of C3h, but its point group is higher.\n    *   Molecule B (Triisopropyl borate) has a conformer with C3h symmetry.\n    *   Molecule C (Mellitic trianhydride) is a rigid molecule whose point group is exactly C3h.\n\n    In chemistry multiple-choice questions about point groups, the answer is typically the molecule whose highest-order point group is the one specified. Molecule C fits this description perfectly as its point group is exactly C3h. It represents a more definitive and less ambiguous example than the conformational symmetry of molecule B or the higher symmetry of molecule A.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule's three-dimensional structure. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has a C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis, and no other symmetry elements except for the identity (E) and a C3^2 rotation, which are implied. The presence of C3 and σh also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3):**\n    *   The molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2).\n    *   The most stable conformation has the BO3 core being planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n    *   The three isopropoxy groups can be arranged in a propeller-like fashion. Due to steric hindrance, they twist out of the BO3 plane.\n    *   For a σh plane to exist, the plane containing the B and O atoms must be a mirror plane. However, reflecting an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2) through this plane does not result in an identical structure because the two methyl groups and the hydrogen on the methine carbon are not symmetrically arranged with respect to this plane. Therefore, triisopropyl borate lacks a σh plane and its point group is C3, not C3h.\n\n2.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   This is a large, disc-shaped molecule based on a triphenylene core.\n    *   Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry.\n    *   The attached furan-dione groups (-C4O3-) are fused to the benzene rings.\n    *   Looking at the structure, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the center of the molecule.\n    *   Each of the three lobes of the molecule is a mirror image of the other, but they are arranged in a propeller-like fashion. The molecule as a whole lacks vertical mirror planes (σv) or dihedral planes (σd) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   If the molecule were perfectly planar, it would possess a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule itself. In this case, the symmetry would be D3h.\n    *   However, due to steric hindrance between the oxygen atoms of adjacent furan-dione groups, the molecule is forced into a non-planar, helical conformation. This twisting eliminates the σh plane and the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The resulting point group is D3, which includes a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes, but no mirror planes.\n\n3.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine, with a cage-like structure. It can be viewed as three ethylene bridges (-CH2-CH2-) connecting a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the bridgeheads.\n    *   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon (the C-H group). Rotation by 120° or 240° maps the molecule onto itself.\n    *   However, quinuclidine does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. Such a plane would have to pass through the midpoints of the three ethylene bridges, but this operation does not leave the molecule invariant.\n    *   It does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is C3v.\n\n4.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is an oxide of benzene, C12O6. Its structure consists of a central benzene ring with three furan-dione rings fused to it. It is also known as benzenehexacarboxylic trianhydride.\n    *   The molecule is planar. The C3 rotational axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n    *   The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting all atoms through this plane leaves them in their original positions.\n    *   The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane confirms that the molecule belongs to the C3h point group. The presence of these two elements also implies an S3 improper rotation axis. It does not possess C2 axes perpendicular to C3, nor vertical mirror planes (σv), so the point group is not D3h or C3v.\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nA molecule belongs to the **C3h point group** if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 principal axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 120 degrees around this axis.\n2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule is indistinguishable after reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis.\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis as well.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3**\n*   The central part of the molecule consists of a boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms (BO3). This core is trigonal planar, and a C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n*   However, each oxygen is attached to a bulky isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]. Due to steric hindrance (crowding) between these bulky groups, they will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is achieved by twisting out of the BO3 plane in a \"propeller-like\" fashion.\n*   This propeller conformation preserves the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, the most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3 symmetry**, not C3h. While a C3h conformation is theoretically possible, it would be very high in energy and is not the molecule's representative structure.\n\n**B) quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   This is a rigid, cage-like molecule.\n*   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen (N) atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n*   However, the molecule does not have a mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting through such a plane would require swapping the N atom with the CH group, which is not a symmetry operation as they are different.\n*   Instead, quinuclidine has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   A molecule with one C3 axis and three σv planes belongs to the **C3v point group**. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   This is the chemical name for **mellitic trianhydride (C12O9)**. The structure consists of a central benzene ring with three five-membered anhydride rings fused to its alternating sides (i.e., fused to the C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6 bonds).\n*   The molecule is a large, conjugated system, which strongly favors a planar geometry.\n*   There is a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. Rotating by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a mirror plane. This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, so it is a **σh plane**.\n*   The molecule has both a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks other symmetry elements (like C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or vertical mirror planes) that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **C3h point group**.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   This molecule is analogous to C, but it's built on a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings.\n*   The three anhydride rings are fused to the outer \"bay regions\" of the triphenylene system.\n*   Like molecule C, if this molecule were planar, it would have C3h symmetry for the same reasons (a C3 axis and a σh plane).\n*   However, fusing groups onto the bay regions of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons creates significant steric strain (in this case, between the anhydride groups and hydrogen atoms on adjacent rings). This strain is well-known to force the molecule to twist out of planarity, adopting a helical or propeller shape to relieve the crowding.\n*   This twisting would destroy the σh mirror plane. The molecule would likely retain its C3 axis, resulting in the **C3 point group**, similar to triisopropyl borate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, molecule C (mellitic trianhydride) is the only one among the choices that is expected to have a stable structure belonging to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.

While a D3h molecule does possess the elements of C3h symmetry (C3 and σh), D3h is a higher order, more complete description of its symmetry.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (also known as hexahydroxybenzene triscarbonate, C9O9)**\n*   Structure: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three carbonate ester rings.

The B(O)3 core is planar.\n*   Symmetry elements:\n    *   Due to the propeller-like arrangement of the three isopropoxy groups around the boron atom, there is a C3 axis passing through the boron, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups are bulky and prevent the molecule from being planar. The lowest energy conformation has C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a specific conformation (even if it's not the most stable one) that possesses a σh plane. This conformation would have the B(O)3 plane as the mirror plane, with the three isopropyl groups arranged so that for each group, one methyl is above the plane and one is below, with the C-H bond of the isopropyl's central carbon lying in the plane.\n    *   In this conformation, the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Crucially, this molecule lacks the C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, and it also lacks any σv planes. The bulky, asymmetric nature of the isopropyl groups prevents these additional symmetry elements.\n*   Point Group: The absence of C2 axes and σv planes means the point group cannot be D3h or C3v. The highest possible symmetry point group for triisopropyl borate is **C3h**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Molecules B and C are D3h. They have higher symmetry than C3h.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose highest possible symmetry is C3h. In questions of this type, we look for the molecule that belongs to the specified point group, not a higher symmetry supergroup.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThis question asks to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry among the given options. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine its point group.\n\nA point group is a set of symmetry operations (like rotation, reflection, inversion) that leave a molecule unchanged. A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess a C3 rotation axis (rotation by 120°) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. The combination of these two elements also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n1.  **Triisopropyl borate (D)**\n    *   Formula: B(OCH(CH3)2)3\n    *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is expected to be trigonal planar. This would define a potential C3 axis perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n    *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are bulky and not planar. Due to steric hindrance, the isopropyl groups will rotate and twist out of the BO3 plane into a stable, low-energy conformation.\n    *   This conformation will resemble a three-bladed propeller. It will have a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   But, because the groups are twisted, there will be no horizontal mirror plane (σh) containing the BO3 core. The molecule is chiral.\n    *   The point group of triisopropyl borate in its most stable conformation is C3.\n\n2.  **Quinuclidine (B)**\n    *   Formula: C7H13N (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)\n    *   Structure: This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is a C3 rotation axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite CH bridgehead carbon.\n    *   The molecule also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that pass through the C3 axis and bisect the ethylene bridges.\n    *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is C3v.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   Common Name: Mellitic trianhydride\n    *   Formula: C12O9\n    *   Structure: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring to which three pyromellitic anhydride rings (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) are fused. Specifically, they are fused to the 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 positions of the benzene ring.\n    *   The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Additionally, the molecule possesses three C2 rotation axes lying within the molecular plane and passing through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central ring (e.g., one axis through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds).\n    *   Because it has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, its point group is D3h. While a D3h object does have C3h symmetry (C3h is a subgroup of D3h), its full symmetry designation is D3h.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**\n    *   Structure: This molecule has a triphenylene core (a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings with D3h symmetry). Three anhydride rings (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) are fused to the outer C-C bonds at positions that are related by a C3 rotation (positions 1-2, 5-6, and 9-10).\n    *   Like the triphenylene core, the entire resulting molecule is planar.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n    *   The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So it possesses the required elements for at least C3h symmetry.\n    *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements. The parent triphenylene has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. However, the anhydride group, -C(=O)-O-C(=O)-, is not symmetric with respect to a C2 rotation along an axis that bisects the bond it is fused to. The oxygen atom is on one side of the anhydride ring. If we assume the oxygen atoms of the three anhydride rings are all oriented in a \"clockwise\" or \"propeller-like\" fashion, a C2 rotation would not superimpose the molecule onto itself. The C2 axes of the triphenylene core are therefore destroyed.\n    *   Since there are no perpendicular C2 axes, and no vertical mirror planes (σv), the highest point group for this molecule is C3h.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n*   Molecule B belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n*   Molecule C belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n*   Molecule D belongs to the **C3** point group.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule A is the only one whose point group is precisely C3h. Molecule C has D3h symmetry, which is a higher symmetry group that contains all the elements of C3h, but typically these questions ask for the exact point group. Therefore, molecule A is the best and most specific answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n*   **A C3 axis of rotation**: Rotation by 360/3 = 120° about this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. Crucially, a C3h molecule **lacks** any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and any vertical mirror planes (σv), as these would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule provided:\n\n*   **C) quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a rigid bicyclic amine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain this C3 axis. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes places it in the **C3v** point group.\n\n*   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule (C12O9) consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride-like groups fused to its sides. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Point Group**: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places it in the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule (C18O9) is similar to the one above but is based on a larger, planar triphenylene core. It is also planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Just like the previous molecule, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, a σh plane (the molecular plane), three perpendicular C2 axes, and three σv planes.\n    *   **Point Group**: It also belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n*   **B) triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around its single bonds. We must consider its possible conformations.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n        *   **Ground State Conformation**: To minimize steric repulsion between the bulky isopropyl groups, the molecule typically adopts a propeller-like conformation. In this shape, all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction relative to the central BO3 plane. This conformation has a C3 axis, but it lacks a σh plane. Thus, its ground-state point group is **C3**.\n        *   **Existence of a C3h Conformation**: The question asks if the molecule *has* C3h symmetry, which could refer to any possible conformation, not just the lowest energy one. It is possible to construct a conformation of triisopropyl borate that has C3h symmetry:\n            1.  Imagine the boron, the three oxygen atoms, and the three central carbons of the isopropyl groups (the methine carbons) all lie in a single plane. This will be our candidate for the σh plane.\n            2.  For each isopropyl group, place the two methyl (CH3) groups symmetrically, with one above the plane and one below it. The hydrogen atom of the methine group (CH) would lie within the plane.\n            3.  If the three in-plane C-H bonds are all pointed radially outward, the molecule would have D3h symmetry. However, if we \"crank\" or twist all three C-H bonds in the plane by the same angle (while keeping them in the plane), we break the perpendicular C2 axes and the σv planes.\n            4.  This specific, \"cranked\" conformation retains the C3 axis and the σh plane but loses the extra symmetry elements of D3h. Therefore, this conformation belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\n*   Molecules A and D belong to the D3h point group. While D3h is a supergroup of C3h (meaning it has all the symmetry elements of C3h), it's a more symmetric group.\n*   Molecule C belongs to the C3v point group.\n*   Molecule B is the only one that can adopt a conformation whose point group is exactly **C3h**. In chemical point group problems, we look for the molecule that fits the specified group precisely.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer because it is the only molecule among the choices that can possess C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which molecule has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Understanding C3h Symmetry\nA molecule possesses C3h symmetry if it belongs to the C3h point group. The key symmetry elements for this group are:\n1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule is unchanged after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A **σh horizontal mirror plane**: The molecule is unchanged after reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nThe C3h point group also includes an S3 improper rotation axis, which is a consequence of having both a C3 axis and a σh plane (S3 = C3 * σh).\n\nIt is important to note that a molecule belonging to a higher symmetry point group that contains all the elements of C3h (like D3h) also \"has C3h symmetry\". The D3h point group contains a C3 axis, a σh plane, and additionally three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule provided:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (B)**:\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with a highly rigid structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead C-H group.\n    *   However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. Instead, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (C)**:\n    *   The formula is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. The core BO3 unit is trigonal planar.\n    *   Due to significant steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, the molecule adopts a propeller-like conformation.\n    *   This propeller structure has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   The point group of the lowest-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry. While a high-energy conformation with C3h symmetry could theoretically be constructed on paper, it is not the molecule's representative structure.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   This complex IUPAC name describes an isomer of mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). The structure consists of a central benzene ring symmetrically fused with three anhydride-like rings.\n    *   The molecule is a large, rigid, polycyclic system which is known to be planar.\n    *   The planar structure has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Furthermore, due to the high symmetry of the fusion, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of this molecule is **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule has C3h symmetry.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   This name describes a larger analogue of the molecule in option D. The core is triphenylene instead of benzene.\n    *   Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The fusion pattern `[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']` is C3-symmetric, adding three anhydride-like rings to the periphery of the triphenylene core.\n    *   The resulting molecule is a large, planar, and highly symmetric disc-shaped molecule.\n    *   Like molecule D, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, a σh plane (the molecular plane), and three perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   Therefore, the point group of this molecule is also **D3h**. As with option D, this means it possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth molecules A and D have D3h symmetry. Since the C3h point group is a subgroup of the D3h point group, both molecules possess the required C3 and σh symmetry elements. In a multiple-choice question where only one answer can be correct, this presents an ambiguity. However, if the question is well-posed, we must choose the best fit. Both structures described in A and D are textbook examples of molecules with D3h symmetry. Without further information to distinguish between them (e.g., if one was non-planar due to strain, or one name was invalid), both A and D are technically correct. Often in such cases, any example with the superset symmetry (D3h) is considered a valid answer. Given that both A and D are of the D3h point group, and the question is likely from a standard source, either molecule would be a correct example. Let's select one of the valid options. Both A and D are correct examples of molecules with the required symmetry. Based on the options, let's select A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\n*   **Analysis of C3h Symmetry**\n    A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess two key symmetry elements:\n    1.  A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule can be rotated by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis and remain indistinguishable.\n    2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule must have a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    The presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The point group consists of the symmetry operations {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Candidate Molecules**\n\n    1.  **A) triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The B atom and the three O atoms (the BO3 core) are trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry: Due to the bulkiness of the isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie in the BO3 plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they adopt a propeller-like arrangement, where they are all twisted in the same direction out of the BO3 plane.\n        *   This propeller conformation possesses a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms above the plane does not result in equivalent atoms below the plane.\n        *   Conclusion: The stable ground-state conformation of triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, not C3h. A C3h structure would represent a high-energy transition state, not the equilibrium geometry.\n\n    2.  **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n        *   Structure: A cage-like bicyclic amine with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n        *   Symmetry: It has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the N atom and the opposing bridgehead C-H group. Rotation by 120 degrees maps the three bridges onto one another.\n        *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis, because the N-end of the molecule is different from the CH-end.\n        *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n        *   Conclusion: Quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group.\n\n    3.  **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (mellitic trianhydride)**\n        *   Structure: This molecule is the trianhydride of mellitic acid. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride groups [-C(O)OC(O)-] on alternating sides.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar. Its plane of planarity acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   Crucially, in addition to C3 and σh, this molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule and passing through the center. This higher degree of symmetry places it in a different point group.\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of C3, σh, and 3C2 axes means the molecule's point group is D3h. While it contains the C3h symmetry elements, its full point group is D3h. Typically, such questions ask for the molecule whose full and correct point group is the one specified.\n\n    4.  **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   Structure: This is a larger analogue of molecule D. It has a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. The three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The three-fold symmetric arrangement of the anhydride groups preserves the C3 axis of the triphenylene core.\n        *   However, the anhydride groups [-C(O)OC(O)-] lack the internal symmetry to preserve the C2 axes or the vertical mirror planes (σv) of the parent D3h triphenylene framework. For example, a C2 axis would need to map the -CO-O-CO- group onto itself after a 180° rotation, which is not possible.\n        *   Conclusion: By removing the C2 and σv elements but retaining C3 and σh, the symmetry of the molecule is reduced from D3h to C3h. This molecule's point group is exactly C3h.\n\n*   **Final Decision**\n    -   Molecule A has C3 symmetry.\n    -   Molecule C has C3v symmetry.\n    -   Molecule D has D3h symmetry.\n    -   Molecule B has C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1.

The question asks for the molecule whose complete symmetry designation is C3h.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n*   **B) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   **Structure:** A cage-like molecule with a nitrogen (N) at one bridgehead and a CH group at the opposite bridgehead, connected by three -CH2-CH2- bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the N atom and the opposing C atom of the CH group. Rotating by 120° interchanges the three ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis, as reflecting the N atom through such a plane would not land on the C atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. This is not C3h.\n\n*   **D) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n    *   **Structure:** A central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is approximately trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n        *   However, due to steric hindrance between the bulky isopropyl groups, they will twist out of the BO3 plane into a \"propeller\" conformation. In this lowest-energy conformation, all three groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller arrangement breaks the horizontal mirror symmetry. There is no σh plane.\n    *   **Point Group:** The ground-state conformation has a C3 axis but lacks other elements like σh or C2 axes. Its point group is **C3**. This is not C3h. (While a high-energy, unstable eclipsed conformation might theoretically have a σh plane, chemical point groups refer to the stable ground-state structure).\n\n*   **C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic anhydride)**\n    *   **Structure:** A planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three cyclic anhydride groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It is planar, so it has a mirror plane in the plane of the molecule (σh).\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition to the C3 axis and σh plane, it has further symmetry. There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane (perpendicular to the C3 axis). Each C2 axis passes through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 group family. The additional presence of the σh plane elevates the symmetry to **D3h**.\n    *   **Point Group:** Since the molecule belongs to the higher symmetry group D3h, it is not correctly classified as C3h.\n\n*   **A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** A planar molecule consisting of a central triphenylene core fused with three cyclic anhydride groups in a C3-symmetric fashion.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It is a planar molecule, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the triphenylene system.\n        *   Now, we must check for other symmetry elements.

Analyze the Symmetry of Each Molecule**\n\n*   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic Trianhydride)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a **σh plane**.\n        *   However, it *also* has three **C2 axes** lying in the molecular plane, passing through the bonds connecting the anhydride groups.\n        *   It also possesses vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it has the additional C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis, its point group is **D3h**. While it contains the C3 and σh elements, its full symmetry is described by a higher-order group.\n\n*   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a larger planar molecule with a triphenylene core, which is essentially three benzene rings fused together. Three anhydride groups are fused to the outer edges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to molecule A, this large, disc-like molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** through its center, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane is a **σh plane**.\n        *   It also has perpendicular **C2 axes** and **σv planes**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Like molecule A, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n*   **D) Quinuclidine**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions, linked by three two-carbon (ethylene) chains.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   However, there is **no horizontal mirror plane (σh)** perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting the top half (near the N) through a perpendicular plane does not produce the bottom half (near the CH).\n        *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Its point group is **C3v**.\n\n*   **C) Triisopropyl borate**\n    *   **Structure:** B(O-iPr)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]. Molecules with single bonds like B-O and O-C can adopt various conformations due to free rotation. We need to see if a plausible conformation exists with C3h symmetry.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Let's construct a C3h conformation:\n        *   Place the central boron (B) atom at the origin of a coordinate system. Place the C3 axis along the z-axis.\n        *   Arrange the three oxygen atoms in the xy-plane, forming an equilateral triangle around the boron. This xy-plane will be our potential **σh plane**.\n        *   For each of the three isopropyl groups, let's also place the central carbon atom (the 'CH' part) in the xy-plane. This is sterically possible.\n        *   Now, consider the two methyl groups (-CH3) and the single hydrogen (-H) attached to this carbon. For the xy-plane to be a mirror plane, we must arrange these attachments symmetrically above and below the plane. This can be achieved if the hydrogen atom also lies in the xy-plane, and one methyl group is positioned above the plane while the other is an exact mirror image below the plane.\n        *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this same orientation, the entire molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n        *   Does this conformation have other symmetries? If we try to find a C2 axis perpendicular to the C3 axis, we fail. Rotating 180° around an axis in the plane (e.g., along a B-O bond) does not leave the molecule unchanged because the 'up' and 'down' methyl groups would be swapped into non-equivalent positions. It also lacks σv planes for similar reasons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Triisopropyl borate can adopt a specific conformation that belongs precisely to the **C3h** point group. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformation (which is calculated to have C3 symmetry), its existence makes it the only correct answer among the choices for a molecule that has (i.e., can have) C3h symmetry without belonging to a higher symmetry group.\n\n**Final Answer determination**\n- Molecule A and B belong to the D3h point group.\n- Molecule D belongs to the C3v point group.\n- Molecule C is the only one that can exhibit a structure belonging to the C3h point group.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to identify which of the four given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Define C3h Symmetry:**\n    *   **C3 axis:** This is a principal axis of rotation. When the molecule is rotated by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis, it remains unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** This is a plane of symmetry that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. If you reflect all atoms through this plane, the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if its complete set of symmetry operations consists of the identity (E), C3 rotations (C3, C3²), a horizontal reflection (σh), and improper rotations (S3, S3⁵). The key is the presence of *both* a C3 axis and a σh plane, and the absence of other elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes that would place it in a higher symmetry group like C3v or D3h. However, in multiple-choice questions, \"has C3h symmetry\" can sometimes mean \"possesses at least a C3 axis and a σh plane\".\n\n3.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n\n    *   **A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n        *   Structure: It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-iPr). The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry: There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. However, the three isopropyl groups are bulky and sterically hindered. To minimize this repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a propeller-like fashion. This twisting eliminates the possibility of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that would coincide with the BO3 plane.\n        *   Conclusion: The molecule has a C3 axis but lacks a σh plane. Its point group is C3. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane):**\n        *   Structure: This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n        *   Symmetry: It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom (CH). A 120° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. However, there is no mirror plane perpendicular (horizontal) to this C3 axis. There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   Conclusion: The molecule has a C3 axis and σv planes, but no σh plane. Its point group is C3v. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n    *   **B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n        *   Common Name: This is also known as mellitic trianhydride (C12O9).\n        *   Structure: It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to its alternating sides.\n        *   Symmetry: The molecule is planar.\n            *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n            *   The plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   Because the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane, it meets the minimum requirements.\n            *   Upon further inspection, it also has three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of these additional symmetry elements means its full point group is actually D3h.\n        *   Conclusion: While the molecule's point group is D3h, it is the only option that possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane. A D3h group contains all the symmetry operations of the C3h group. In the context of this question, it is the best fit.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n        *   Structure: This is a larger version of molecule B, built on a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core.\n        *   Symmetry: Unlike molecule B, this molecule is not planar. The steric hindrance between the oxygen atoms of adjacent anhydride groups (in the \"bay regions\") forces the molecule to twist into a helical, propeller-like shape.\n        *   Conclusion: This twisted structure has a C3 axis, but because it is non-planar, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its point group is C3. Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n4.  **Final Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   Molecule A: C3 (has C3, no σh)\n    *   Molecule B: D3h (has C3, has σh)\n    *   Molecule C: C3 (has C3, no σh)\n    *   Molecule D: C3v (has C3, no σh)\n\n    Only molecule B possesses the essential combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Although its complete point group (D3h) is of higher symmetry than C3h, it is the only choice that contains the defining elements of C3h symmetry. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A C3 axis of rotation: Rotation by 120° about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  A σh horizontal mirror plane: A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**D) Quinuclidine** (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)\n*   **Structure**: This is a cage-like molecule with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and bisect one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. A plane in the middle of the cage would not reflect the top half onto the bottom half.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane defines the **C3v** point group. Thus, quinuclidine is not C3h.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone** (Mellitic trianhydride)\n*   **Structure**: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups (-C(O)-O-C(O)-) on alternating sides. The formula is C12O9. The molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   Being planar, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   In addition to these, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, each passing through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central ring.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D point group family.\n*   **Point Group**: A C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane define the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains the C3h symmetry elements (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. Usually, questions about point groups ask for the highest possible point group describing the molecule's entire symmetry.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is a planar D3h molecule. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically onto the outer rings of the triphenylene structure.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: Like the triphenylene core, the resulting large molecule is also planar. The high symmetry is preserved. It possesses:\n    *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   A σh horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane).\n    *   Three C2 axes within the plane.\n*   **Point Group**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule has **D3h** symmetry. It is of a higher symmetry order than C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The arrangement around the boron atom is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: We need to consider possible conformations.\n    *   The lowest energy conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape, where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction to minimize steric hindrance. This conformation has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes, giving it a C3 point group.\n    *   However, it is possible to envision an idealized, higher-energy conformation that exhibits C3h symmetry. In this conformation:\n        1.  The boron atom, the three oxygen atoms, the three adjacent carbons (methine carbons), and their attached hydrogens lie in a single plane. This plane can act as the σh mirror plane.\n        2.  For each isopropyl group, one methyl group (-CH3) is positioned above this plane, and the other is below it.\n        3.  The molecule has a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n    *   This specific conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. Does it have other symmetry elements, like the perpendicular C2 axes that would raise it to D3h? No. Because the B-O-C bond is bent (not 180°), the isopropyl groups are \"cranked\" relative to the B-O bonds. If you attempt a C2 rotation along one B-O bond, the other two isopropyl groups do not map onto each other.\n*   **Point Group**: Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule on the list for which **C3h** is its highest possible point group (even if it's for an idealized conformation).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMolecules A and C have D3h symmetry. Molecule D has C3v symmetry. Molecule B is the only one that fits the C3h point group without belonging to a higher symmetry group. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\n*   **Analysis of the Symmetry of Each Molecule**\n\nTo determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule and determine its point group.

Three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges connect the two bridgeheads.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon. A 120° rotation around this axis maps each ethylene bridge onto the next.\n        *   It has three **vertical mirror planes (σv)**. Each plane contains the C3 axis and bisects one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   It **lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh)** perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane means its point group is **C3v**.\n\n2.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a large, planar aromatic core called triphenylene, to which three anhydride-like groups are fused. The triphenylene core itself is highly symmetric.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it possesses a **σh mirror plane**, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n        *   Crucially, it also possesses three **C2 axes** lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group:** A molecule with a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane belongs to the **D3h** point group. While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h (a C3 axis and a σh plane), its overall symmetry is higher. Usually, such questions ask for the full point group of the molecule.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to its alternating sides (1,2-, 3,4-, and 5,6- positions).\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a **σh mirror plane** (the molecular plane).\n        *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   It **lacks C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis.

It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and three O atoms are nearly coplanar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        *   Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. This conformation gives the molecule a **C3 axis** passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, it **lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh)**. The hydrogen atoms on the central carbon of each isopropyl group and the methyl groups are not in the B(O)3 plane, and reflecting them across this plane does not result in an identical structure.\n    *   **Point Group:** In its most stable conformation, the point group is **C3**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nComparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n*   A) Quinuclidine: **C3v**\n*   B) Triphenyleno[...]...: **D3h**\n*   C) Benzo[...]...: **C3h**\n*   D) Triisopropyl borate: **C3**\n\nThe only molecule whose point group is C3h is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.

If we orient it such that the methine C-H bond also lies in the σh plane, one methyl group (-CH3) will be above the plane, and the other will be below. Reflection in the σh plane will exchange the positions of these two methyl groups, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this conformation, arranged symmetrically around the C3 axis, the entire molecule will have a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements. There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, and there are no σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** An idealized, low-energy conformation of triisopropyl borate has exactly the C3 and σh elements (and the implied S3 improper rotation axis), and no others. Therefore, its point group is **C3h**. While the absolute ground state at low temperature might be a slightly twisted C3 structure, C3h represents a readily accessible and highly symmetric conformation that perfectly fits the point group description.\n\nComparing the options, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule whose highest plausible symmetry point group is C3h.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
