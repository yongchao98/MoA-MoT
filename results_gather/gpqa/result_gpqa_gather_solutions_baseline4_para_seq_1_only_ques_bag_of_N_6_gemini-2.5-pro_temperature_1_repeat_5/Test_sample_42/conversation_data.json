Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this is the principal functional group, and the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO) is named as a **formyl** group.\n    *   Cyano (-CN) is named as a **cyano** group.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH) is named as a **hydroxy** group.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂) is named as a **(dimethylamino)** group.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃) is named as a **methoxy** group.\n\n### 2. Draw the Structure Based on Positional Information\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring, starting with the principal functional group at C1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (This defines the parent benzoic acid).\n\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it, meaning the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C2 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C6) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C6 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C2) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\nBoth structures fully satisfy the description. Fortunately, as we will see, IUPAC rules lead to the same name for both. Let's name Structure I.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   Numbering starts at C1. We can number clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   The set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both directions.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we number in the direction that gives the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n*   Now, let's write the sequence of locants for this alphabetical list for both numbering directions:\n    *   **CW Numbering (2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂):**\n        *   Cyano is at 3.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 6.\n        *   Formyl is at 5.\n        *   Hydroxy is at 2.\n        *   Methoxy is at 4.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n    *   **CCW Numbering (2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, 5-CN, 6-OH):**\n        *   Cyano is at 5.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 2.\n        *   ...and so on.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n*   We compare the two sequences term by term: {**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4} vs {**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4}. Since 3 is lower than 5, the first sequence is preferred.\n*   Therefore, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct (CW) numbering, the locants are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nList these alphabetically to construct the final name:\n3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A. (If we were to name Structure II, the same procedure would also lead to this exact name, as the counter-clockwise direction would be chosen).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituent Positions:** Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, with the -COOH group at C1.\n\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't yet know which is where.\n    *   **\"a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: This means the carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguities:** The final piece of information is: **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) can be at C3 or C5.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C5, it must be at C6.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C6.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C2) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C3. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C3, it must be at C2.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C2.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C6) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules to Both Possible Structures:** The descriptive text is ambiguous and fits two different molecules. We must name both and then apply a tie-breaking rule. The locants for the substituents in both cases are the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we choose the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's alphabetize the substituent names:\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl (the prefix for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**. We should choose the structure where the cyano group has the lower number.\n\n    *   **Naming Structure I (from Case 1):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   The name is: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option D).\n\n    *   **Naming Structure II (from Case 2):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C3**.\n        *   The name is: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option C).\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Name:** According to the IUPAC tie-breaking rule, we must give the lowest locant to the first group in alphabetical order (cyano). Structure II gives the cyano group locant 3, while Structure I gives it locant 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure II and its corresponding name are correct.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned locant number **1**.\n\n**2. Draw the Structure Based on the Positional Information**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the ring starting with C1 = -COOH.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at **C2 and C6** (we don't know which is which yet).\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at **C3 and C5**. This also satisfies the condition that they are meta to each other (C3 and C5 are meta).\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key constraint to finalize the structure.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group, so the -CN must be at **C3 or C5**.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**: Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**: Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nIt turns out both possibilities describe valid structures (which are enantiomers of each other). However, they will have the same IUPAC name (without stereochemical descriptors) because the naming rules are unambiguous. Let's pick one of these valid structures to name.\n\nLet's use the structure where: -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2.\nThis means the remaining groups are: -N(CH3)2 at C6 and -CHO at C5.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n*   **C1**: -COOH\n*   **C2**: -OH\n*   **C3**: -CN\n*   **C4**: -OCH3\n*   **C5**: -CHO\n*   **C6**: -N(CH3)2\n\n**3. Number the Ring According to IUPAC Rules**\n\n*   C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering direction that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent that appears first alphabetically is chosen.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker**\n\nThe substituents (other than the parent acid) are:\n*   cyano (-CN)\n*   dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) -> alphabetized under 'd'\n*   formyl (-CHO) -> the name for an aldehyde group as a substituent\n*   hydroxy (-OH)\n*   methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nNow, let's check the locant for the first group in this list (\"cyano\") in both numbering directions:\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering (as drawn above)**: -OH is at C2, **-CN is at C3**.\n*   **Clockwise numbering**: -N(CH3)2 is at C2, -CHO is at C3, -OCH3 is at C4, **-CN is at C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**. The locants are assigned as we determined in Step 2.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\n\n*   **Parent name**: benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents with correct locants**: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n*   **Arrange alphabetically**:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   **Combine**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the written description into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO, also named as the substituent \"formyl\"), and a cyano group (-CN). They are all *meta* (1,3-position) to one another. This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Assigning Initial Positions:** Let's place the highest priority group, the carboxylic acid (-COOH), at position C1. This makes the parent molecule a benzoic acid. The other two groups, -CHO and -CN, must be at C3 and C5 to satisfy the *meta-to-each-other* condition.\n*   **Placing Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2)\". The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3)\". The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". The nitrile (-CN) is at C5 (we could have placed it at C3, the result would be the same after renumbering).\n        *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n    *   **Finalizing the Structure:** Since the -OH group is at C6, the other group ortho to the carboxylic acid, the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), must be at **C2**.\n\nThe final, unambiguous structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n### 2. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, functional groups are prioritized. The order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic Acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\nWe must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n*   **C1** is fixed at the -COOH group.\n*   We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Path A (Clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering paths result in the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: the substituents are assigned the lowest possible locants based on their alphabetical order.\n*   The substituent names are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   We compare the two paths by looking at the locant assigned to the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Path A (clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 5.\n    *   In Path B (counter-clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise) is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\nThe correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-dimethylamino**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nTo write the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n\n1.  **C**yano: **3-cyano**\n2.  **D**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for clarity with complex substituents)\n3.  **F**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n4.  **H**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **M**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - This uses the incorrect (clockwise) numbering.\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering and lists the substituents non-alphabetically.\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This uses the correct numbering but lists the substituents non-alphabetically (by locant order).\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" prefix)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions C3 and C5. For these three groups to be meta to each other, they must be in a 1,3,5-arrangement.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nSo far, the partial structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key to resolving the arrangement. \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH), and \"nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile (-CN) group:\n        1.  **If -CN is at C3:** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        2.  **If -CN is at C5:** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\nThe description is slightly ambiguous as it can describe two molecules that are mirror images of each other (enantiomers). However, IUPAC naming rules will lead to a single, unambiguous name. Let's pick one of the valid structures (the first one we found) and apply the naming rules.\n\n**Structure:**\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe principal group (-COOH) is at C1. We need to number the ring (from C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n1.  There are two ways to number the ring: clockwise (C1 -> C2 -> C3...) or counter-clockwise (C1 -> C6 -> C5...).\n2.  In both cases, the set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This is a tie.\n3.  To break the tie, we give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n5.  The first group alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In our determined structure, the cyano group is at C3. If we numbered the other way, the dimethylamino group would be at C2 and the cyano group would be at C5.\n    *   Comparing the locant for \"cyano\": 3 is lower than 5.\n    *   Therefore, the correct numbering direction is the one that places the cyano group at C3. Our derived structure already uses this correct numbering.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nThe complete name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents are not listed alphabetically)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct: matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (-COOH, -CHO, -CN, -OH). Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents Based on the Description:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and Cyano (-CN):** These are *meta* to the carboxylic acid (C1) and *meta* to each other. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. For them to be meta to each other, one must be at C3 and the other at C5.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3):** *Para* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The para position is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2):** Both are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, one of these groups is at C2 and the other is at C6.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile is the cyano group (-CN). We know it's at C3 or C5.\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is ortho to both C3 and C5, so this part of the constraint is already satisfied.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN). Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This means the remaining ortho position, **C6**, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group. The formyl group would be at **C5**.\n        *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This means the remaining ortho position, **C2**, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group. The formyl group would be at **C3**.\n\n    Both Case 1 and Case 2 produce valid structures that fit the description. We must now use IUPAC numbering rules to decide which is correct.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\n    *   The C1 position is fixed by the principal functional group (-COOH).\n    *   We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   In both Case 1 and Case 2, the substituents occupy positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The locant set is identical, so we have a tie.\n    *   **Tie-breaking rule:** When the locant set is the same, we assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents and Break the Tie:**\n    *   The substituent prefixes are: `cyano` (-CN), `dimethylamino` (-N(CH3)2), `formyl` (-CHO), `hydroxy` (-OH), and `methoxy` (-OCH3).\n    *   In alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible locant.\n    *   In Case 1, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In Case 2, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use the arrangement from **Case 1**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Name from the Correct Arrangement (Case 1):**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        *   C1: -COOH (benzoic acid)\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   **Assemble the name:** List the substituents with their locants in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n    *   **Final Name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived name `3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\n*   The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n*   Therefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. The parent molecule is named as a benzoic acid.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as carbon #1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents based on Relative Positions**\n\nLet's place the groups on the benzene ring, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **-COOH at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as 'formyl' substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group are at C3 and C5.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\"\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6.\n*   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nAt this point, we have the following assignments:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Configuration**\n\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: 'alcohol' refers to the hydroxyl group, and 'nitrile' refers to the cyano group).\n\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   We know the hydroxyl group is at either C2 or C6.\n*   We know the cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case A: Assume the cyano group is at C5.** For the methoxy (C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at C4 and C6. This matches our partial structure, so the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n*   **Case B: Assume the cyano group is at C3.** For the methoxy (C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at C4 and C2. This also matches our partial structure, so the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n\nWe now have two possible structures:\n\n*   **Structure A:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH\n*   **Structure B:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Structure**\n\n*   IUPAC rules state that when there is a choice in numbering, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents listed as prefixes.\n*   The locant set for both structures is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so this rule doesn't resolve the tie.\n*   The tie-breaker rule is to assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Structure A, \"cyano\" is at C5.\n    *   In Structure B, \"cyano\" is at C3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Structure B is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the positions from the correct structure (Structure B), we assemble the name.\n\n*   **Structure B:**\n    *   C2: hydroxy\n    *   C3: cyano\n    *   C4: methoxy\n    *   C5: formyl\n    *   C6: dimethylamino\n*   List the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   Combine these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe name we derived matches option C exactly.\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, based on Structure A)\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, based on Structure A)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC rules for nomenclature, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as carbon #1.\n\n**Step 2: Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\nLet's map out the positions of all groups on the benzene ring, starting with C1 for the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** at C1.\n*   **Methoxy group:** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". Para to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   **Carbaldehyde and Cyano groups:** \"all meta to one another\" (referring to -COOH, -CHO, and -CN). Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. Thus, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5 (in some order).\n*   **Hydroxyl and Dimethylamino groups:** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". Ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. Thus, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6 (in some order).\n\nAt this point, the basic structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n*   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at positions C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C5. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This arrangement is consistent with all the given information.\n*   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at positions C4 and C2. We know methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C3. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This arrangement is also consistent with all the given information.\n\nIt seems there are two possible structures. However, these two structures are actually the same molecule, just viewed from different perspectives (they are mirror images that can be renumbered to be identical). The IUPAC naming rules will resolve this and lead to a single correct name.\n\nLet's analyze the structure derived from Case 2 (it doesn't matter which case we pick, as they represent the same molecule).\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (ortho to -CN at C3)\n*   C3: -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C5: -CHO (the other meta group)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Correct IUPAC Numbering**\nIUPAC rules state that after assigning C1 to the principal functional group, we number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents. In this case, the substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so this rule doesn't help decide the direction of numbering (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).\n\nThe next rule is to assign the lowest numbers based on the alphabetical order of the substituents.\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nWe have two possible numbering schemes for our molecule:\n*   **Numbering A (clockwise):** 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   **Numbering B (counter-clockwise):** 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n\nWe compare these schemes based on the alphabetical list. The first substituent is \"cyano\".\n*   In Numbering A, \"cyano\" gets the locant **3**.\n*   In Numbering B, \"cyano\" gets the locant **5**.\nSince 3 is lower than 5, we **must** use Numbering A.\n\nSo, the correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   Cyano: 3\n*   Dimethylamino: 6\n*   Formyl: 5\n*   Hydroxy: 2\n*   Methoxy: 4\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\nNow, we write the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the functional groups mentioned and determine their priority according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' as a substituent.\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy' as a substituent.\n*   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nThe IUPAC priority order for these groups is:\n1.  **Carboxylic acid**\n2.  Nitrile (Cyano)\n3.  Aldehyde (Formyl)\n4.  Alcohol (Hydroxy)\n5.  Amine (Dimethylamino)\n6.  Ether (Methoxy)\n\nSince the carboxylic acid has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure\n\nNow, we place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n1.  **-COOH is at C1.**\n2.  The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** to one another. Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5.\n3.  A **hydroxyl (-OH)** group and a **dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂)** group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6.\n4.  A **methoxy (-OCH₃)** group is **para** to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n\n5.  We use the final piece of information to resolve the ambiguities: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group must be ortho to both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The ortho positions to the methoxy group at C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our earlier finding.\n    *   So, the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test these two possibilities:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3:** Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works. If -OH is at C2, then -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C6, and -CHO must be at C5.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5:** Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works. If -OH is at C6, then -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C2, and -CHO must be at C3.\n\nThis gives us two possible structures.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -CN at C3):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CN at C5):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. The -COOH group is fixed at C1.\n\n*   For **Structure 1**, the locants are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   For **Structure 2**, the locants are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nSince both numbering schemes result in the same set of locants {2,3,4,5,6}, we must apply the next rule: give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**.\n\n*   In **Structure 1**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In **Structure 2**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we list the substituents alphabetically and attach their corresponding locants.\n\n*   Structure 1 positions:\n    *   C3: Cyano\n    *   C6: Dimethylamino\n    *   C5: Formyl\n    *   C2: Hydroxy\n    *   C4: Methoxy\n\n*   Assembling the name in alphabetical order:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and order)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct numbering and alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the description to build the chemical structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among all the given functional groups, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Major Groups:**\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are both *meta* to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are also *meta* to one another. If one is at C3 and the other at C5, they are separated by C4, which is a meta relationship. This confirms the 1,3,5-substitution pattern for the -COOH, -CHO, and -CN groups.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The para position is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** The methoxy group (at C4) and the alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (cyano group, -CN).\n        *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position (C3 or C5).\n        *   **Case a:** If the cyano group is at **C3**, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. We already know the methoxy group is at C4. The constraint says the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This leaves **C6** for the dimethylamino group and **C5** for the carbaldehyde group.\n        *   **Case b:** If the cyano group is at **C5**, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. Methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This leaves **C2** for the dimethylamino group and **C3** for the carbaldehyde group.\n\n4.  **Finalizing the Structure:**\n    Let's assemble the structure from Case a:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n    Let's assemble the structure from Case b:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n    If you rotate the structure from Case b in the plane of the ring or flip it over, you will find it is the same molecule as the one from Case a. The IUPAC naming system is designed to give only one unique name for a single molecule, so we can proceed with either representation. We will use the structure derived from Case a.\n\n### Step 2: Apply IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Numbering the Ring:** The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1. We need to number the other carbons (C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   **Clockwise (CW) numbering:** The substituents (-OH, -CN, -OCH3, -CHO, -N(CH3)2) get the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (CCW) numbering:** The substituents (-N(CH3)2, -CHO, -OCH3, -CN, -OH) get the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n2.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** Since both numbering directions give the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the next rule: choose the numbering that gives the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n3.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n4.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"Cyano\".\n    *   In the **CW** numbering, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the **CCW** numbering, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n5.  **Assign Final Locants:** Based on the correct CW numbering, the locants for the substituents are:\n    *   2-Hydroxy\n    *   3-Cyano\n    *   4-Methoxy\n    *   5-Formyl\n    *   6-Dimethylamino\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Final Name\n\nWrite the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number. Then, add the parent name.\n\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: prefixes are not in alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong locants and not alphabetized)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. Among the given functional groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy), the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant (position number) **1**.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituents based on the Description**:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is at position **C1**.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH3)** is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is **C4**. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** groups are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 occupy positions C2 and C6.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN occupy positions C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use Additional Constraints to Determine the Exact Positions**: The problem states that the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the hydroxyl (-OH at C2 or C6) groups are both *ortho* to the cyano group (-CN at C3 or C5).\n    *   **Case 1: Assume the cyano group (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. This would require the methoxy group to be at C4 (which it is) and the hydroxyl group to be at C6. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position)\n        *   C3: -CHO (the remaining meta position)\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n    *   **Case 2: Assume the cyano group (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. This would require the methoxy group to be at C4 (which it is) and the hydroxyl group to be at C2. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   C5: -CHO (the remaining meta position)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position)\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Rules for Numbering**: We have two possible valid arrangements of substituents, both using the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the set of locants, IUPAC rules state that we should assign the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents**: The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\n6.  **Choose the Correct Numbering**:\n    *   In **Case 1**, the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano\", is at position **5**.\n    *   In **Case 2**, the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano\", is at position **3**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Case 2** is the correct numbering scheme according to IUPAC rules.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final Name**: Using the arrangement from Case 2, we list the substituents alphabetically, preceded by their locants, and finish with the parent name.\n    *   Arrangement: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n    *   Alphabetical listing:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Full Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options**: This constructed name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol > Amine). Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Map the Substituents based on the description:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl):** meta to C1 (i.e., at C3 or C5).\n    *   **Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano):** meta to C1 (i.e., at C3 or C5, the one not taken by -CHO) and also meta to the -CHO group. Placing them at C3 and C5 satisfies the condition that they are meta to each other and to C1.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy):** para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy):** ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino):** ortho to the carboxylic acid. It must occupy the other ortho position (C2 or C6).\n\n3.  **Resolve the Ambiguity using the Final Clue:** The problem states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) is at C2 or C6.\n\n    Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n    *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho to C5). This fits.\n        *   The alcohol (-OH) must be at C6 (the other ortho position to C5). This fits.\n        *   This places the remaining dimethylamino group at C2 and the formyl group at C3.\n        *   Let's check the meta condition: -COOH (1), -CHO (3), -CN (5). They are all meta to each other. This structure is valid.\n        *   **Structure A:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho to C3). This fits.\n        *   The alcohol (-OH) must be at C2 (the other ortho position to C3). This fits.\n        *   This places the remaining dimethylamino group at C6 and the formyl group at C5.\n        *   Let's check the meta condition: -COOH (1), -CN (3), -CHO (5). They are all meta to each other. This structure is also valid.\n        *   **Structure C:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure:** We have two possible structures that fit the description, both with substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. According to IUPAC rules, when two different numbering schemes produce the same set of locants, we must use alphabetical order as a tie-breaker. The substituent that comes first alphabetically should be assigned the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   **List substituents alphabetically:**\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n    *   **Compare the two structures:**\n        *   In Structure A, the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **5**.\n        *   In Structure C, the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **3**.\n\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme for **Structure C is the correct one**.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name from Structure C:** Now we write the name for Structure C, listing the substituents in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n\n    *   **Structure C:**\n        *   C1: Benzoic acid\n        *   C2: Hydroxy\n        *   C3: Cyano\n        *   C4: Methoxy\n        *   C5: Formyl\n        *   C6: Dimethylamino\n\n    *   **Assemble the name alphabetically:**\n        *   3-cyano-\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n        *   5-formyl-\n        *   2-hydroxy-\n        *   4-methoxy-\n        *   benzoic acid\n\n    *   **Final Name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:** This name matches option C exactly.\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and non-alphabetical order)\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct structure but non-alphabetical order)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The first step in naming a polysubstituted benzene ring is to identify the principal functional group, which will determine the parent name and the numbering of the ring. The functional groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority order for these groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Hydroxyl > Amino\n\n    Therefore, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Draw and Number the Structure:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description:\n    *   **Position 1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Ortho to -COOH (Positions 2 and 6):** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Para to -COOH (Position 4):** A methoxy (-OCH3) group is para to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Meta to -COOH (Positions 3 and 5):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid.\n\n    Now, let's use the other positional information to place the substituents unambiguously:\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 4 is also *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN). This means the nitrile must be at position 3 or 5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) is also *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN). The alcohol is at position 2 or 6. If the nitrile is at position 3, the alcohol must be at position 2. If the nitrile is at position 5, the alcohol must be at position 6.\n\n    Let's try assigning the nitrile to position 3:\n    *   **Position 1:** -COOH\n    *   **Position 3:** -CN (meta to -COOH, ortho to -OCH3 at 4)\n    *   **Position 4:** -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must be ortho to the nitrile, so it is at **Position 2**. This is consistent with it being ortho to the -COOH.\n    *   The remaining ortho position to -COOH is 6. This must be where the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) goes.\n    *   The remaining meta position is 5. This is where the carbaldehyde (-CHO) must go. This is consistent with it being meta to -COOH.\n\n    So, the substitution pattern is:\n    *   1: -COOH\n    *   2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n3.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now we list the substituents (other than the principal group) in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers.\n    *   Cyano (C)\n    *   Dimethylamino (D)\n    *   Formyl (F)\n    *   Hydroxy (H)\n    *   Methoxy (M)\n\n    Let's assemble the name based on this order and their positions:\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n    *   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n    Our constructed name, \"3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid,\" matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a polysubstituted benzene derivative. The process involves three main steps:\n1.  Deduce the structure of the molecule from the description.\n2.  Determine the correct numbering of the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules.\n3.  Assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 1: Deducing the Structure**\n\n1.  **Parent Compound:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. By convention, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Placing Substituents:**\n    *   We place the -COOH group at C1.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5. They are also meta to each other, which is consistent with being at C3 and C5.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the -COOH group. This places it at C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the -COOH group. This means they occupy positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A final crucial piece of information is given to resolve the ambiguity of the C2/C6 and C3/C5 positions: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   The nitrile (cyano) group must be at a position where C4 is an ortho position. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Therefore, the nitrile group could be at C3 or C5.\n        *   Let's assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3. The positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The description states that the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. Since methoxy is at C4, this means the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2.\n        *   This arrangement places the -OH at C2. Since -OH and -N(CH3)2 are on C2 and C6, the -N(CH3)2 group must be at C6.\n        *   This also means the remaining major substituent, the carbaldehyde (-CHO), is at C5.\n\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all the information:\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   -COOH, -CHO (at C5), -CN (at C3) are all meta to one another. (Correct)\n    *   -OH (at C2) and -N(CH3)2 (at C6) are ortho to -COOH. (Correct)\n    *   -OCH3 (at C4) is para to -COOH. (Correct)\n    *   -OCH3 (at C4) and -OH (at C2) are ortho to -CN (at C3). (Correct)\n\nThe structure is confirmed.\n\n**Step 2: IUPAC Numbering**\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We now need to decide whether to number the ring clockwise or counter-clockwise to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Numbering Scheme 1 (Clockwise, as deduced above):**\n    *   Substituents at: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n*   **Numbering Scheme 2 (Counter-clockwise):**\n    *   This would place -N(CH3)2 at C2, -CHO at C3, -OCH3 at C4, -CN at C5, and -OH at C6.\n    *   The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering schemes produce the exact same set of locants, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering that gives a lower number to the first substituent in alphabetical order is chosen.\n\n**Step 3: Alphabetizing and Assembling the Name**\n\n1.  **List and Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   Cyano (-CN)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   Formyl (-CHO)\n    *   Hydroxy (-OH)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\n2.  **Apply Tie-breaker Rule:** We compare the locants for each substituent in alphabetical order for the two numbering schemes.\n    *   **Cyano:** Scheme 1 gives it **3**. Scheme 2 gives it **5**. Since 3 < 5, Scheme 1 (clockwise numbering) is the correct one.\n\n3.  **Final Locants (from Scheme 1):**\n    *   2-Hydroxy\n    *   3-Cyano\n    *   4-Methoxy\n    *   5-Formyl\n    *   6-Dimethylamino\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name:** Combine the alphabetically-ordered prefixes with their correct locants, followed by the parent name. Parentheses are used for the complex substituent \"dimethylamino\".\n\n    `3-cyano-`\n    `6-(dimethylamino)-`\n    `5-formyl-`\n    `2-hydroxy-`\n    `4-methoxy`\n    `benzoic acid`\n\n    The full name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents based on Relative Positions:**\n    *   **Principal Group:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n    *   **Para Group:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   **Meta Groups:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1). The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, the formyl and cyano groups are at C3 and C5, in some order.\n    *   **Ortho Groups:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6, in some order.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure:**\n    *   The problem states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Nitrile is the -CN group, alcohol is the -OH group).\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4 and the hydroxyl group is at either C2 or C6. The cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Cyano (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and hydroxyl (-OH) to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This is a valid arrangement.\n        *   **Case 2: Cyano (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and hydroxyl (-OH) to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid arrangement.\n\n4.  **Establish the Two Possible Structures (Numbering Schemes):**\n    *   From the analysis above, we have two potential structures that fit the description. Both have -COOH at C1 and -OCH3 at C4.\n    *   **Structure A (from Case 1):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl) - *since -CN is at C3*\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) - *since -OH is at C2*\n        *   The locant set (positions of substituents) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Structure B (from Case 2):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) - *since -OH is at C6*\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl) - *since -CN is at C5*\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Tie-Breaking Rules:**\n    *   When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set (in this case, both are {2,3,4,5,6}), we must use alphabetical order to break the tie.\n    *   The rule is: Assign the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **Cyano**\n        2.  **Dimethylamino**\n        3.  **Formyl**\n        4.  **Hydroxy**\n        5.  **Methoxy**\n    *   Now, we look at the position of the first substituent in our alphabetical list, \"cyano\".\n        *   In Structure A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n        *   In Structure B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Structure A** is the correct one.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    *   Using the correct structure (Structure A), we list the substituents alphabetically, along with their assigned numbers.\n    *   Parent name: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents (alphabetical):\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combining these gives the full name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrectly ordered)\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name)\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a thinking process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The functional groups mentioned are carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as carbon #1 (C1).\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on Relative Positions:**\n*   **-COOH:** At C1.\n*   **-OCH₃ (methoxy):** Para to the carboxylic acid. This means it is at C4.\n*   **-CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano):** Both are meta to the carboxylic acid, so they are at C3 and C5. They are also meta to each other, which is consistent with one being at C3 and the other at C5.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl) and -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino):** Both are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at C2 and C6.\n\nAt this point, the basic structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Positions:**\n*   The clue is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent with what we already know.\n*   The alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This works, as C6 is one of the available ortho positions to the main -COOH group.\n    *   **Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This also works, as C2 is the other available ortho position to the main -COOH group.\n\nThis gives us two possible complete structures.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Structure:**\n*   The IUPAC rule for numbering a ring when two or more numbering schemes give the same set of locants (here, the substituents are always at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n\n*   Let's analyze our two possible structures again:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** -CN is at C5, -OH is at C6. The remaining ortho position (C2) has -N(CH₃)₂, and the remaining meta position (C3) has -CHO. The \"cyano\" group gets number 5.\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** -CN is at C3, -OH is at C2. The remaining ortho position (C6) has -N(CH₃)₂, and the remaining meta position (C5) has -CHO. The \"cyano\" group gets number 3.\n\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering corresponds to **Structure from Case 2**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name:**\n*   The correct structure has the following substituents and locants:\n    *   C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (**2-hydroxy**)\n    *   C3: -CN (**3-cyano**)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (**4-methoxy**)\n    *   C5: -CHO (**5-formyl**)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (**6-(dimethylamino)** - parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   Now, arrange these substituent names alphabetically and place them before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy-**\n*   Combining them gives: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Match with the Provided Options:**\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct locants and correct alphabetical order)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants based on numbering rules)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants and incorrect alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound\n\n*   The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents.\n*   We need to identify the principal functional group to determine the parent name. The priority order for the given functional groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid (-COOH) > Aldehyde (-CHO, carbaldehyde) > Nitrile (-CN, cyano) > Ketone > Alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl) > Amine (-N(CH3)2, dimethylamino) > Ether (-OCH3, methoxy).\n*   The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given relative positions.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to COOH:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to COOH:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n*   **Remaining positions:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl prefix) and a cyano group (-CN) are on the remaining positions, C3 and C5. The description says they are meta to one another, which is consistent with the C3 and C5 positions.\n*   **Nitrile relationships (key to solving ambiguity):**\n    1.  The methoxy group at C4 is ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent.\n    2.  The alcohol (-OH) is also ortho to the nitrile (-CN). This is the crucial piece of information to fix the positions of the ortho and meta groups.\n        *   **Case 1:** Let's assume the -OH group is at C2. The positions ortho to C2 are C1 and C3. Since C1 has the -COOH group, the -CN group must be at **C3**.\n        *   **Case 2:** Let's assume the -OH group is at C6. The positions ortho to C6 are C1 and C5. So the -CN group must be at **C5**.\n\n    Let's follow Case 1, which places -OH at C2 and -CN at C3.\n    *   If -OH is at C2, then the other ortho group, -N(CH3)2, must be at **C6**.\n    *   If -CN is at C3, then the other meta group, -CHO, must be at **C5**.\n\n    Let's verify this structure:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -OH\n    *   **C3:** -CN\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3\n    *   **C5:** -CHO\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH3)2\n\n    This structure satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. The numbering (1 -> 2 -> 3...) is clockwise.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\n*   The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locant set to the substituents.\n*   Let's check both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering from C1:\n    *   **Clockwise:** Substituents are at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise:** Substituents are also at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we use the alphabetical order of the substituent names to break the tie. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that appears first in the alphabet.\n*   The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In the clockwise numbering scheme (derived above), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the counter-clockwise scheme, the -N(CH3)2 group would be at C2, -CHO at C3, -OCH3 at C4, -CN at **C5**, and -OH at C6.\n*   Comparing the locants for \"cyano\": 3 (clockwise) vs. 5 (counter-clockwise). Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow we assemble the full IUPAC name using the correct (clockwise) numbering and alphabetical order of substituents.\n\n1.  **Numbering and Substituents:**\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n2.  **Alphabetize:**\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)  *(Note: The 'di' counts for alphabetization in this case)*\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n3.  **Combine with Parent Name:**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n### 5. Match with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived name with the given options:\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetization.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the question to build the structure of the molecule.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The molecule is a derivative of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. By IUPAC convention, the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the principal functional group (the carboxylic acid) is assigned locant number 1 (C1).\n\n*   **Substituent Placement:**\n    1.  **Carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) are all meta to one another.**\n        *   If -COOH is at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So, the -CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano) groups are at C3 and C5.\n    2.  **Hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino [-N(CH3)2] are ortho to the carboxylic acid.**\n        *   If -COOH is at C1, the ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the -OH and -N(CH3)2 groups are at C2 and C6.\n    3.  **A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid.**\n        *   If -COOH is at C1, the para position is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at C4.\n    4.  **The methoxy group (-OCH3) and the hydroxyl group (-OH) are both ortho to the cyano group (-CN).**\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This confirms the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   This last piece of information allows us to determine the exact arrangement. Let's consider the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n            *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The hydroxyl group (-OH) must be ortho to it. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at C2.\n            *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The hydroxyl group (-OH) must be ortho to it. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at C6.\n\n### 2. Construct the Possible Structures\n\nBased on the deductions above, we can draw two possible structures.\n\n*   **Structure A (from Case 1):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (ortho to -CN at C3)\n    *   C3: -CN (meta to -COOH)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   C5: -CHO (meta to -COOH and -CN)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position to -COOH)\n    This corresponds to numbering clockwise from the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Structure B (from Case 2):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C6: -OH (ortho to -CN at C5)\n    *   C5: -CN (meta to -COOH)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   C3: -CHO (meta to -COOH and -CN)\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position to -COOH)\n    This corresponds to numbering counter-clockwise from the carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth structures fulfill all the descriptive conditions given in the problem. The correct name depends on IUPAC's rules for numbering the benzene ring.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Lowest Locant Set:** We need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   For Structure A (clockwise), the locants are {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   For Structure B (counter-clockwise), the locants are also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we have a tie. We must proceed to the next rule.\n\n2.  **Alphabetical Order Tie-Breaker:** When the lowest locant set rule results in a tie, the numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        1.  **c**yano\n        2.  **d**imethylamino\n        3.  **f**ormyl\n        4.  **h**ydroxy\n        5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   Now, we look for the locant of the first group in this list, 'cyano', in our two possible numbering schemes.\n        *   In **Structure A** (clockwise numbering), the cyano group is at position **3**.\n        *   In **Structure B** (counter-clockwise numbering), the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    *   Since 3 is a lower number than 5, the IUPAC rules prefer the numbering scheme of **Structure A**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow we write the final name using the numbering from Structure A and arranging the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents (with correct locants from Structure A):**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   **Final Name (alphabetized):**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO, also called formyl), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on the Description**\n\nLet's draw the benzene ring and place the substituents according to the given relative positions.\n\n*   **-COOH is at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern for these three groups. Since -COOH is at C1, the **-CHO (formyl)** and **-CN (cyano)** groups must be at positions **C3 and C5**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the **-OH (hydroxy)** and **-N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)** groups are at positions **C2 and C6**.\n*   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position to C1 is C4. So, the **-OCH3 (methoxy)** group is at position **C4**.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Positions**\n\n*   The final clue is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: alcohol = hydroxyl group, nitrile = cyano group).\n*   We know the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   We know the hydroxyl group (-OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The cyano group (-CN) must be positioned ortho to both the -OCH3 at C4 and the -OH group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the cyano group (-CN):\n\n*   **Case A: Assume -CN is at C3.**\n    *   Is C3 ortho to the methoxy group at C4? Yes.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to -CN at C3, the -OH group must be at C2 or C4.\n    *   Since we know -OH is at C2 or C6, it must be at **C2**.\n    *   This arrangement works. The full structure would be:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n*   **Case B: Assume -CN is at C5.**\n    *   Is C5 ortho to the methoxy group at C4? Yes.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to -CN at C5, the -OH group must be at C4 or C6.\n    *   Since we know -OH is at C2 or C6, it must be at **C6**.\n    *   This arrangement also works. The full structure would be:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Two Possible Structures**\n\nWe have two valid structures (A and B) that fit the description. We must use IUPAC rules to decide which numbering scheme is correct.\n\n*   List the substituents (as prefixes) in alphabetical order:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Both numbering schemes (from Case A and Case B) give the same set of locants for the substituents: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   When two or more numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by assigning the lowest number to the substituent cited first in the alphabetical name.\n\nLet's compare the locants for the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\"):\n*   In Case A, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Case A is the correct one**.\n\n**5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the structure and numbering from Case A:\n*   Substituents with their locants: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n*   Parent name: benzoic acid.\n*   Assemble the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n\nThe correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure and alphabetical order)\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (This is the name for the structure from Case B, which is incorrect by the tie-breaker rule)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino\n\nThe highest priority group is the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure of the Molecule\n\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the positional information provided.\n\n*   **-COOH is at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, which is named 'formyl' as a substituent) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this arrangement works.\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl group (-OH) and the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at positions C2 and C6.\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it. Positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's combine these facts to resolve the ambiguities (which group is at C3/C5 and which is at C2/C6):\n\n*   We know the cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   Since the methoxy group at C4 is ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at either **C3** or **C5**. This is consistent.\n*   Now, consider the hydroxyl group. It must be ortho to the cyano group.\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the C1-COOH (i.e., at C2 or C6), the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the C1-COOH (i.e., at C2 or C6), the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**.\n\nThese two cases actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from two different directions. IUPAC numbering rules will determine which is the correct way to number the ring. Let's write down the structure based on Case 1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl, since CN is at C3)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, since OH is at C2)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe have established the connections, but we need to confirm the numbering. We must number the ring starting from C1 (-COOH) in the direction that gives the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n\n*   **Numbering clockwise (as built in Case 1):** The substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** This would correspond to Case 2. The substituents would be at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n\nSince the set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is the same for both directions, we must use the next rule: give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically.\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino (Note: \"dimethylamino\" is a single substituent name and is alphabetized under 'd')\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n*   In the clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n*   In the counter-clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct assignment of locants is:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow, we write the full IUPAC name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituent names)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect, substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.** This matches our derived name exactly.\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. We must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is assigned position **1**.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Key Groups:** \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   This means these three groups occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other on the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, it is at position 1.\n    *   Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions **3 and 5**.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions **2 and 6**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position **4**.\n\n4.  **Final Structural Clue:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. Since the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5, this condition is always met for the methoxy group.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6. It must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), which is at C3 or C5. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case A: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 2 or 4. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C2**.\n        *   **Case B: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 4 or 6. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C6**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Full Structure:**\n    *   From Case A (nitrile at C3):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl, the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, the other ortho group)\n    *   From Case B (nitrile at C5):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   If you examine these two resulting structures, you will find they are identical. Structure B is just Structure A flipped horizontally. Therefore, the description points to a single, unique molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering:** The numbering starts at C1 (-COOH). We need to decide whether to number clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...) or counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...). The rule is to choose the direction that gives the **lowest possible set of locants** to the substituents.\n    *   In our case, the substituents are at all other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the direction.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n4.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n5.  **Comparing Numbering Directions:**\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...):** This gives the locants {2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   **Clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...):** This gives the locants {6-hydroxy, 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 2-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   Let's check the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**.\n\n6.  **Final Name Construction:** We use the locants from the counter-clockwise numbering and list the substituents in alphabetical order.\n    *   The correct locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The name is constructed as: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetization.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants (results from choosing the wrong numbering direction).\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This lists the substituents by number, not alphabetically, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is based on a benzene ring. To determine the parent name, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. The groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    The priority order is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n    Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n    *   **-COOH** is at position **1**.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** are meta to the -COOH. This means they are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3)** is para to the -COOH. This places it at position **4**.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** are ortho to the -COOH. This places them at positions 2 and 6.\n\n    Now we have to figure out the exact arrangement. We use the final piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at position 4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n        *   **Case 1: Cyano at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case 2: Cyano at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\n    The description also states that the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the hydroxyl is at C2. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C6.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the hydroxyl is at C6. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\n    Both cases are possible so far. Let's check the position of the carbaldehyde group. It must be at the remaining meta position (3 or 5).\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the carbaldehyde is at C5.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\n    This means we have two possible numbering schemes for the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\n    *   **Scheme A (Counter-clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2\n    *   **Scheme B (Clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-N(CH3)2, 3-CHO, 4-OCH3, 5-CN, 6-OH\n\n3.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Lowest Locant Rule):**\n    We need to choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest set of locants for the substituents. The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both schemes.\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker rule: when two or more numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the direction is chosen that assigns the lowest number to the group cited first as a prefix in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    The prefixes for the substituents are:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n    Alphabetically, \"cyano\" comes first. Therefore, we must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   In Scheme A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Scheme A**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Scheme A, we have:\n    *   at C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   at C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   at C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   at C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   at C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   at C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    Now, list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy-**\n\n    Combine these alphabetically and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\" at the end.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Molecular Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description into a list of substituents and their relative positions on a benzene ring.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Functional Groups:**\n    1.  Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    2.  Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n    3.  Cyano group (-CN)\n    *   These three groups are **meta** to one another (e.g., at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n*   **Other Substituents (relative to the carboxylic acid):**\n    4.  Hydroxyl group (-OH), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    5.  Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    6.  Methoxy group (-OCH₃), **para** to -COOH.\n*   **Additional Positional Constraints:**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the relevant groups is:\n\n**Carboxylic acid** > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol (Hydroxyl) > Amine > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given information.\n\n1.  Place the **-COOH** group at position **C1**.\n2.  Since the methoxy group is **para** to the -COOH, place the **-OCH₃** group at position **C4**.\n3.  The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are **meta** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n4.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\nOur ring currently looks like this:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C2/C6:** One is -OH, the other is -N(CH₃)₂\n*   **C3/C5:** One is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\nNow, we use the final constraints to determine the exact positions:\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. Its ortho positions are C3 and C5. So the cyano group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the position of -CN:\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for the -OH group.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position for the -OH group.\n\nThese two cases (Case A and Case B) actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective (they are enantiomers, but achiral due to a plane of symmetry if we consider the substituents themselves as points, but they are indeed the same molecule by rotation around the C1-C4 axis). Let's proceed with the structure from Case A, which is sufficient to determine the single correct IUPAC name.\n\nBased on Case A:\n*   If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n    *   The remaining meta position, C5, must be the **-CHO** group.\n    *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must be the **-N(CH₃)₂** group.\n\nThe final, unique structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH\n*   **C3:** -CN\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C5:** -CHO\n*   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂\n\n### 4. Number the Ring and Name the Molecule\n\nThe numbering starts with C1 for the -COOH group. We need to number the rest of the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n*   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince there is a tie, IUPAC rules state that we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent (cyano) gets in each numbering scheme:\n*   With our derived structure (C2=-OH, C3=-CN, etc.), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the positions would be C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH₃, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. In this case, the cyano group would be at C5.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering scheme is the one that assigns C3 to the cyano group. This corresponds to the structure as we derived it.\n\nThe final positions are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\nFinally, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem requires a systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core and Substituents:**\n    *   The core is a **benzene ring**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' when it's not the principal group.\n        *   Cyano (-CN), also known as nitrile.\n        *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy'.\n        *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n2.  **Determine the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group:**\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure based on Positional Information:**\n    *   Start by placing the -COOH group at **C1**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group\": The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5. Since all three are meta to each other, this 1,3,5-arrangement is confirmed. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\n    Let's write out the full structures for both cases:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH)\n\n4.  **Apply Numbering Rules (Lowest Locants):**\n    *   The numbering must start from C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise. The goal is to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   For both structures derived above, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    The correct alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n6.  **Apply the Tie-breaker and Finalize the Name:**\n    Let's analyze the numbering for the unique structure we have determined.\n    *   The structure is: C1(-COOH), C4(-OCH₃), C2/C6 (-OH, -NMe₂), C3/C5 (-CN, -CHO), with the specific constraints from step 3.\n    *   Let's consider the structure from Case 1 above: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-clockwise):** The substituents would be at: C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n        *   In Direction 1, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   In Direction 2, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Direction 1**.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Direction 1:\n    *   Parent: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents with locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combine them alphabetically: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The generated name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: Incorrect numbering (violates the tie-breaker rule).\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: **Correct.**\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **Para (C4) Substituent:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Meta (C3 & C5) Substituents:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) and also meta to each other. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n*   **Ortho (C2 & C6) Substituents:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n\n**3. Use Additional Information to Fix the Structure**\n\nWe have one more piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C5, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C3**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C2, the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C3, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C5**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\nNotice that these two cases describe the exact same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring. We have now unambiguously determined the constitution of the molecule. The final step is to apply the correct numbering rule.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Rule 1: Lowest Locants.** We start at C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   Clockwise numbering gives the substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering also gives the locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both directions give the same set of locants, we must use a tie-breaker rule.\n*   **Rule 2 (Tie-breaker): Alphabetical Priority.** When the locant set is identical, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl (for the -CHO group)\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must choose the numbering direction that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n\n*   **Numbering Direction 1 (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The cyano group is at **C5**.\n*   **Numbering Direction 2 (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2. The cyano group is at **C3**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering is the one from Direction 2.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (C3-cyano), we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants:\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino) - parenthesis is used for complex substituents like dimethylamino.\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\", we get the full IUPAC name:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and identify the substituents and their relationships.**\n    *   **Parent structure:** A benzene ring.\n    *   **Principal functional group:** The question lists several functional groups. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n    *   **Substituents and their positions relative to the -COOH group (C1):**\n        *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the -COOH group. The para position to C1 is C4. So, C4 has an -OCH3 group.\n        *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the -COOH group. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the set of substituents at {C2, C6} is {-OH, -N(CH3)2}.\n        *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the -COOH group. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the set of substituents at {C3, C5} is {-CHO, -CN}.\n    *   **Additional constraints:**\n        *   The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all *meta* to one another. This means they occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other. This is consistent with our assignments above (C1, C3, C5).\n        *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" This is a crucial piece of information to determine the exact arrangement of the substituents. Let's analyze this:\n            *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n            *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n            *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n            *   For three groups (A, B, C) where A and B are ortho to C, they must be arranged such that C is in the middle of A and B on the ring (e.g., A at C2, C at C3, B at C4).\n            *   Let's test the possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n                *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at C2. (Positions C2 and C4 are ortho to C3). This configuration is possible.\n                *   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at C6. (Positions C4 and C6 are ortho to C5). This configuration is also possible.\n\n2.  **Resolve the ambiguity to identify the single correct structure.**\n    The description allows for two possible constitutional isomers.\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the -CHO group.\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   This structure is: {1:-COOH, 2:-OH, 3:-CN, 4:-OCH3, 5:-CHO, 6:-N(CH3)2}.\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** If -CN is at C5 and -OH is at C6:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C3, must have the -CHO group.\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   This structure is: {1:-COOH, 2:-N(CH3)2, 3:-CHO, 4:-OCH3, 5:-CN, 6:-OH}.\n\n    Since the question asks for *the* correct IUPAC name, there should be a single answer. The description is ambiguous. However, in such cases, we can apply the IUPAC tie-breaking rule for numbering (P-14.4) to choose between the two resulting structures. The rule states that if there's a choice, we select the scheme that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first alphabetically.\n\n3.  **Name the substituents and determine their alphabetical order.**\n    *   -CN: cyano\n    *   -N(CH3)2: dimethylamino\n    *   -CHO: formyl\n    *   -OH: hydroxy\n    *   -OCH3: methoxy\n    *   Alphabetical order: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\n4.  **Apply the alphabetical tie-breaker to choose between the two possible structures.**\n    We compare the locant assigned to each substituent (in alphabetical order) in the two possible structures. The structure that gives a lower number at the first point of difference is preferred.\n\n    *   **Structure 1 Locants:**\n        *   cyano: 3\n        *   dimethylamino: 6\n        *   formyl: 5\n        *   hydroxy: 2\n        *   methoxy: 4\n        *   Locant set in alphabetical order: {3, 6, 5, 2, 4}\n\n    *   **Structure 2 Locants:**\n        *   cyano: 5\n        *   dimethylamino: 2\n        *   formyl: 3\n        *   hydroxy: 6\n        *   methoxy: 4\n        *   Locant set in alphabetical order: {5, 2, 3, 6, 4}\n\n    *   **Comparison:** We compare the sets term by term.\n        *   First term (for 'cyano'): 3 (from Structure 1) vs. 5 (from Structure 2).\n        *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1 is the preferred structure** according to this tie-breaking principle.\n\n5.  **Assemble the final IUPAC name for the chosen structure (Structure 1).**\n    *   **Structure 1:** {1:-COOH, 2:-OH, 3:-CN, 4:-OCH3, 5:-CHO, 6:-N(CH3)2}\n    *   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n    *   **Substituents with locants:** 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n    *   **Combine in alphabetical order:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n6.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The derived name `3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (-COOH, -CHO, -CN). Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Translate the Positional Information into a Structure:**\n    *   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at **C4**.\n    *   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as 'formyl' as a substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are at the meta positions, which are C3 and C5. The phrase \"all meta to one another\" is geometrically impossible but is best interpreted as these three groups occupying the 1, 3, and 5 positions.\n    *   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at the ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Clue to Resolve Ambiguities:** The crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. For the clue to be true, the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group must be at C2 and C4. We know methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for it. This implies the dimethylamino group is at C6, and the formyl group is at C5.\n    *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. For the clue to be true, the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group must be at C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position. This implies the dimethylamino group is at C2, and the formyl group is at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure:**\n    We have two potential structures, which correspond to the two ways of numbering the ring from C1 (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    Since both numbering directions yield the same lowest locant set ({2,3,4,5,6}), we must use the next rule: assign the lowest possible numbers to the substituents in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino (alphabetized under 'd')\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n6.  **Compare the Locants based on Alphabetical Order:**\n    We compare the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\") for each structure.\n    *   In Structure 1, cyano is at C3.\n    *   In Structure 2, cyano is at C5.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Structure 1 is correct**.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using the substituent names and their locants from the correct structure (Structure 1), we arrange them in alphabetical order.\n    *   Substituents: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n    *   Alphabetical Order: Cyano, Dimethylamino, Formyl, Hydroxy, Methoxy\n    *   Full Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Match with the Options:**\n    This name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure and alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure based on numbering rules)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano group (-CN), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy group (-OCH3).\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amine > Ether.\n    The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, so the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents Based on a Fixed Point:**\n    *   The problem states that a **methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid**. Since the -COOH group is at C1, the methoxy group (-OCH3) must be at **C4**.\n\n3.  **Place the Remaining Substituents Using the Given Relationships:**\n    *   A **hydroxyl group (-OH)** and a **dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2)** are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   A **carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a 'formyl' substituent)** and a **cyano group (-CN)** are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n    *   A key constraint is that the **methoxy group (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (-CN)**.\n        *   Let's test where the nitrile (-CN) group can be. It must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   If the nitrile is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is indeed at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n        *   If the nitrile is at C3, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is indeed at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n    *   This gives us two possible arrangements. We need to use the IUPAC numbering rules to decide between them.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Break the Tie:**\n    The rule for numbering a substituted benzene ring (after assigning C1 to the principal functional group) is to number the ring to give the substituents the **lowest possible set of locants**. If a choice still remains, we give the lowest number to the substituent that comes **first alphabetically**.\n\n    Let's analyze the two possible structures:\n\n    *   **Structure 1:** Let's place the hydroxyl group at **C2** and the nitrile at **C3**.\n        *   C1: -COOH (Principal)\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the formyl group: **C5: -CHO** (formyl).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the dimethylamino group: **C6: -N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino).\n        *   The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    *   **Structure 2:** Let's place the hydroxyl group at **C6** and the nitrile at **C5**.\n        *   C1: -COOH (Principal)\n        *   C2: The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the dimethylamino group: **C2: -N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino).\n        *   C3: The remaining meta position, C3, must have the formyl group: **C3: -CHO** (formyl).\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    Both structures give the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Now we must use the alphabetical order tie-breaker.\n\n5.  **Apply the Alphabetical Tie-Breaker Rule:**\n    *   First, list the substituent names in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **cyano**\n        2.  **dimethylamino** (the 'd' in dimethyl counts for alphabetization)\n        3.  **formyl**\n        4.  **hydroxy**\n        5.  **methoxy**\n    *   Now, compare the two structures based on the locant of the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\").\n        *   In **Structure 1**, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n        *   In **Structure 2**, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n    *   The rule is to choose the numbering that gives the lower locant to the first point of difference. Since 3 < 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using Structure 1, we assemble the name by listing the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   Structure 1 positions: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   Alphabetical order: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n    *   Final Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived name perfectly matches option C.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering based on the alphabetical tie-breaker.\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order of substituents.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct**.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order of substituents.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the textual description into a chemical structure. Let's place the groups on a benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Identify the main groups:** We have a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) that are all *meta* to one another. The most logical way to arrange this is to place them at positions 1, 3, and 5 on the ring. Let's arbitrarily assign the carboxylic acid to position 1 for now, as it will likely be the principal functional group.\n    *   Position 1: -COOH\n    *   Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde)\n    *   Position 5: -CN (cyano)\n\n2.  **Add the remaining substituents relative to the carboxylic acid (-COOH):**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)₂). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)₂} are at {C2, C6}.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH₃). The para position is C4. So, -OCH₃ is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the final piece of information to resolve ambiguities:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy group (-OCH₃) at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n    *   This means the alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be in the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   If the -OH group is at C6, then the dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] must be at the remaining ortho position relative to the carboxylic acid, which is C2.\n\n4.  **Finalized Structure:** Based on this deductive process, we have the following arrangement of substituents (this is just one possible numbering for drawing, not the final IUPAC numbering):\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **C3:** -CHO\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃\n    *   **C5:** -CN\n    *   **C6:** -OH\n\n### 2. Determine the IUPAC Name\n\nNow, we apply the IUPAC rules of nomenclature to this specific structure.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** We compare the priority of the functional groups present: Carboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Number the Ring:**\n    *   The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **C1**.\n    *   We must then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible set of locants. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Let's check the locant sets for both directions, based on our derived structure:\n        *   **Numbering Clockwise:** Substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Set: {2,3,4,5,6}\n        *   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise:** The substituents would be -OH at C2, -CN at C3, -CHO at C4, -N(CH3)2 at C5, and -OCH3 at C6. But this does not match our structure. We must stick to the structure we derived. Let's re-state the substituents based on their actual positions on the ring relative to C1: C2 has -N(CH3)2, C3 has -CHO, C4 has -OCH3, C5 has -CN, and C6 has -OH.\n        *   **Numbering Counter-clockwise from C1:** C2 would have -OH, C3 would have -CN, C4 would have -OCH3, C5 would have -CHO, and C6 would have -N(CH3)2.\n    *   The locant set is **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}** in both directions.\n\n3.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **c**yano (-CN)\n        *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n        *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n        *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    *   The first substituent in the alphabetical list is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives 'cyano' the lower number.\n        *   In the **clockwise** direction (C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO,...), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   In the **counter-clockwise** direction (C2=-OH, C3=-CN,...), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the correct IUPAC numbering is **counter-clockwise**.\n\n4.  **Assign Final Locants and Assemble the Name:**\n    Using the correct counter-clockwise numbering, we get:\n    *   C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (**2-hydroxy**)\n    *   C3: -CN (**3-cyano**)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (**4-methoxy**)\n    *   C5: -CHO (**5-formyl**)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (**6-(dimethylamino)**)\n\n    Now, assemble the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name perfectly matches option D.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order)\n    *   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), and methoxy (-OCH₃). According to IUPAC rules for nomenclature priority, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituent Positions:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the location of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is at C1.**\n    *   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"** The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be meta to each other as well. This implies a 1,3,5 substitution pattern for these three groups. So, if -COOH is at C1, then -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5 (in some order).\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"** The position para to C1 is C4. So, a methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at **C4**.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\"** The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) are at C2 and C6 (in some order).\n    *   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** We know the methoxy group is at C4 and the nitrile (-CN) group is at C3 or C5. For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile must be at **C3** (or C5). The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to this nitrile. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by methoxy, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n\n3.  **Finalize the Structure and Numbering:**\n    Based on the deductions above, we can finalize the positions:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   **C2:** -OH (Hydroxyl), confirmed from the last clue.\n    *   **C3:** -CN (Cyano), confirmed from the last clue.\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃ (Methoxy), para to COOH.\n    *   **C5:** -CHO (Formyl/Carbaldehyde), meta to COOH and CN.\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino), filling the last ortho position to COOH.\n\n    This arrangement satisfies all conditions given in the description. This numbering direction (counter-clockwise) must be chosen over the clockwise direction. According to IUPAC rules, if the locant sets are identical (both are 2,3,4,5,6), we give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically. The alphabetically first substituent is \"cyano\". In our chosen scheme, cyano is at C3. In the alternative (clockwise) scheme, it would be at C5. Since 3 < 5, our counter-clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n4.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   The substituents are: **c**yano (C3), **d**imethylamino (C6), **f**ormyl (C5), **h**ydroxy (C2), **m**ethoxy (C4).\n    *   The prefixes are alphabetized as: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n    *   We add the corresponding position numbers (locants) before each prefix.\n    *   The complete name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. Note that parentheses are used for the complex substituent \"dimethylamino\".\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived name with the given choices:\n    A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n    B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This perfectly matches our derived name.\n    C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n    D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical ordering of substituents.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nThis is a problem that requires applying the rules of IUPAC nomenclature for substituted aromatic compounds. Let's break down the structure of the molecule step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of the Main Substituents:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** (1,3-relationship) to one another.\n    *   If -COOH is at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5.\n    *   Since the -CHO and -CN groups are also meta to each other, this arrangement (C1, C3, C5) is consistent. For now, let's tentatively place -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Remaining Substituents:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are **ortho** (1,2-relationship) to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is **para** (1,4-relationship) to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This places it at C4.\n    *   We are given a final piece of information to resolve the ambiguity: the methoxy group (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are both **ortho** to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   We tentatively placed the -CN group at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This fits perfectly.\n        *   Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n        *   Since the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6, and we've now placed the hydroxyl group at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n        *   This also confirms that our initial placement of -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5 was correct.\n\n4.  **Summarize the Structure:**\n    *   C1: -COOH (part of the parent name, benzoic acid)\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules:**\n    *   **Numbering:** We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (positions) to the substituents. Starting from C1 (-COOH), we can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n        *   Clockwise: C2-dimethylamino, C3-formyl, C4-methoxy, C5-cyano, C6-hydroxy. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n        *   Counter-clockwise: C2-hydroxy, C3-cyano, C4-methoxy, C5-formyl, C6-dimethylamino. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n        *   When the locant sets are identical, we use alphabetical order of the substituents to decide the numbering. We assign the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically at the first point of difference.\n        *   The first point of difference is C2 vs. C6. We have \"dimethylamino\" vs. \"hydroxy\".\n        *   \"**D**imethylamino\" comes before \"**h**ydroxy\" in the alphabet.\n        *   Therefore, the dimethylamino group gets the lower number (C2), and the numbering proceeds clockwise. Our assignments in step 4 are correct.\n\n    *   **Alphabetize the Prefixes:** The substituent groups must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name. The prefixes are:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   **Assemble the Final Name:** Combine the prefixes in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, and add the parent name at the end.\n        *   5-cyano-\n        *   2-(dimethylamino)-\n        *   3-formyl-\n        *   6-hydroxy-\n        *   4-methoxy\n        *   benzoic acid\n\n    *   The complete name is: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name.**\n    *   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThis question asks for the correct IUPAC name of a substituted benzene derivative. To determine this, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure**: The molecule is based on a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom bearing the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Substituent Positions based on C1**:\n    *   **Para (C4)**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at **C4**.\n    *   **Ortho (C2, C6)**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethyl amino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. So, these two groups are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   **Meta (C3, C5)**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. So, these two groups are at positions **C3** and **C5**. The problem also states these three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to one another, which is consistent with them being at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n3.  **Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Isomer**: The description provides a key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities at positions (C2/C6) and (C3/C5): \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) can be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) can be at C2 or C6.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n        *   **Case i: If -CN is at C3**, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For both the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This fixes the arrangement:\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n            *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n            *   This leaves C5 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C6 for the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2). This defines a specific constitutional isomer (let's call it Isomer 1).\n        *   **Case ii: If -CN is at C5**, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For both the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This also fixes the arrangement:\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n            *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n            *   This leaves C3 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C2 for the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2). This defines a second constitutional isomer (Isomer 2).\n\nSince the problem asks for a single correct IUPAC name, the nomenclature rules must distinguish between these two isomers and select one as having the correct name provided in the options.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Principal Functional Group**: Carboxylic acid is the highest priority group, so it determines the parent name (benzoic acid) and C1 position.\n\n2.  **Numbering the Ring**: We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   In both Isomer 1 and Isomer 2, the substituents are at all available positions: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule**: When the locant sets are identical, we assign the lowest numbers based on the alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes. The substituent cited first alphabetically gets the lowest possible locant.\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n    *   The substituent that comes first is **cyano**. Its possible locations in the ring are C3 or C5. According to the tie-breaking rule, it should be assigned the lower number, which is **3**.\n    *   This rule selects **Isomer 1** as the correct structure, where the cyano group is at C3. It also dictates that the numbering must proceed in the direction that assigns '3' to the cyano group (i.e., clockwise).\n\n4.  **Final Naming**: Based on this logic, the correct structure is Isomer 1, and the numbering is clockwise.\n    *   C1: -COOH (parent name: benzoic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    Now, we write the full name by arranging the prefixes alphabetically:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\n    Combining these gives the name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing with Options\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nB) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nC) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\nD) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name matches option A exactly.

Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a **benzene ring**.\n*   The highest priority functional group mentioned is the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n*   Therefore, the parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on their Positions**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring relative to C1.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) is at one of these positions, and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is at the other.\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**:\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   The condition that the carbaldehyde and cyano group are also meta to each other is satisfied if one is at C3 and the other at C5.\n\nAt this point, our ring looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH or -N(CH3)2\n*   C3: -CHO or -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C5: -CN or -CHO (the opposite of C3)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 or -OH (the opposite of C2)\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Structure**\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous finding.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to C5, it must be at C4 or C6. C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group. Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C6**. This means the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**, and the formyl group must be at **C3**.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to C3, it must be at C2 or C4. C4 is occupied by the methoxy group. Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C2**. This means the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**, and the formyl group must be at **C5**.\n\nBoth cases lead to a fully defined structure. Let's see if they are the same molecule, just numbered differently.\n*   **Structure from Case 1:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n*   **Structure from Case 2:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\nIf you rotate Structure 1 in the plane or flip it, you cannot turn it into Structure 2. However, the IUPAC naming rules will select only one of these as the correctly numbered version of a single molecule. Let's realize that Structure 1 is just Structure 2 numbered in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise vs. clockwise). The molecule itself is unique.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nThe goal is to number the ring (starting with C1 for the -COOH group) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. In this case, substituents are at C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6, so the locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of which direction we number (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n\nWhen the locant sets are identical, we break the tie by giving the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    1.  **C**yano (-CN)\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    3.  **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n    5.  **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\n*   Now let's check our two numbering directions for the unique molecule:\n    *   **Numbering Path A (corresponding to Case 2):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2.\n    *   **Numbering Path B (corresponding to Case 1):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH.\n\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In Path A, cyano is at **C3**.\n    *   In Path B, cyano is at **C5**.\n\n*   Since 3 < 5, **Path A is the correct IUPAC numbering**.\n\n**5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (Path A), the positions are:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\nNow, we list these substituents alphabetically, prefixed with their locants, before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  3-cyano\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)\n3.  5-formyl\n4.  2-hydroxy\n5.  4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents not listed alphabetically)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n\nThe name we derived matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Description and Identify Substituents\nFirst, let's break down the textual description of the molecule into its components and their relative positions.\n*   **Parent Ring:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂), named as 'dimethylamino' prefix.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃), named as 'methoxy' prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1 (C1).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure Based on Positional Constraints\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given relative positions.\n\n1.  **-COOH is at C1.**\n2.  **`para` to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.** The `para` position to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4.**\n3.  **`A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.`** Since -COOH is at C1, the other two groups (-CHO and -CN) must be at C3 and C5. This creates two possibilities for the arrangement.\n4.  **`Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.`** The `ortho` positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH and -N(CH₃)₂} are located at {C2 and C6}.\n5.  **`The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.`** This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For a group to be `ortho` to methoxy, it must be at C3 or C5. So, the nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent with point 3.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n\n*   **Case A: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   For the alcohol (-OH) to be `ortho` to the nitrile at C5, it must be at C4 or C6.\n    *   We know -OCH₃ is at C4, so the **-OH group must be at C6.**\n    *   Since {-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at {C2, C6}, the **-N(CH₃)₂ group must be at C2.**\n    *   This leaves C3 for the **-CHO group.**\n    *   This gives us **Isomer 1**:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   C3: -CHO\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n\n*   **Case B: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   For the alcohol (-OH) to be `ortho` to the nitrile at C3, it must be at C2 or C4.\n    *   We know -OCH₃ is at C4, so the **-OH group must be at C2.**\n    *   Since {-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at {C2, C6}, the **-N(CH₃)₂ group must be at C6.**\n    *   This leaves C5 for the **-CHO group.**\n    *   This gives us **Isomer 2**:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CHO\n        *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\nBoth isomers (1 and 2) are consistent with the textual description.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the IUPAC \"Lowest Locants\" Rule to Choose the Correct Isomer\nWhen a description can lead to more than one constitutional isomer, IUPAC nomenclature prefers the isomer that results in the lowest possible locant set when the substituents are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nFirst, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nNow, let's find the locant set for each isomer based on this alphabetical list. (Note: The methoxy group is at C4 in both isomers).\n\n*   **Locant Set for Isomer 1:**\n    *   Cyano is at **5**.\n    *   Dimethylamino is at **2**.\n    *   Formyl is at **3**.\n    *   Hydroxy is at **6**.\n    *   Methoxy is at **4**.\n    *   The set is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n\n*   **Locant Set for Isomer 2:**\n    *   Cyano is at **3**.\n    *   Dimethylamino is at **6**.\n    *   Formyl is at **5**.\n    *   Hydroxy is at **2**.\n    *   Methoxy is at **4**.\n    *   The set is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n\nNow, compare the two sets term by term:\n*   Set 1: (5, 2, 3, 6, 4)\n*   Set 2: (3, 6, 5, 2, 4)\n\nAt the first point of difference, the number in Set 2 (**3**) is lower than the number in Set 1 (**5**). Therefore, the IUPAC rules prefer **Isomer 2**.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Correct Name for the Preferred Isomer\nWe have established that the correct structure is Isomer 2:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH\n*   C3: -CN\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n*   C5: -CHO\n*   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\nNow, we name this specific molecule. The parent name is **benzoic acid**. We list the substituents with their locants and arrange them alphabetically:\n*   3-**c**yano\n*   6-(**d**imethylamino)\n*   5-**f**ormyl\n*   2-**h**ydroxy\n*   4-**m**ethoxy\n\nCombining these in order gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules for nomenclature of organic compounds, the priority of these functional groups is as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\nTherefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\n\nWe will build the structure step-by-step based on the relative positions given.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzoic acid. We place the -COOH group at the C1 position.\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   This means these three groups are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n    *   With -COOH at C1, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named \"formyl\" as a substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para (opposite) to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho (adjacent) to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at C2 and C6. We still need to determine which is where.\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's assume the -CN group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The description states the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) are at these positions.\n    *   We already placed the -OCH3 group at C4. This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to the acid, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n    *   And the carbaldehyde (-CHO) group must be at C3.\n\nThis gives us a single, unambiguous structure:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n\nThere are two possible directions to number the ring from C1:\n\n*   **Path A (Clockwise):** C1 -> C2(-NMe2) -> C3(-CHO) -> C4(-OCH3) -> C5(-CN) -> C6(-OH).\n    *   The locants are: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n\n*   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** Let's re-label our determined structure for counter-clockwise numbering starting from C1.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   The locants are: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the identical set of locants (2,3,4,5,6), we must use the tie-breaker rule: we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize Substituents and Apply Tie-Breaker\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare the locants for each substituent in our two paths. We look for the first point of difference.\n\n| Substituent (Alphabetical) | Path A Locant (Clockwise) | Path B Locant (Counter-clockwise) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Cyano** | 5 | **3** |\n| Dimethylamino | 2 | 6 |\n| Formyl | 3 | 5 |\n| Hydroxy | 6 | 2 |\n| Methoxy | 4 | 4 |\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\". Path A gives it locant 5, while Path B gives it locant 3. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise numbering) is the correct IUPAC numbering scheme.**\n\n### 5. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct numbering from Path B:\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order followed by the parent name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule\n\nThe problem describes a benzene ring with several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the number **C1**.\n\n### 2. Draw the Molecular Structure from the Description\n\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the provided relative positions.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to -COOH:** A methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **C4 is -OCH3**.\n*   **Ortho to -COOH:** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n*   **Meta to one another:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all meta to one another.\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   The relationship between C3 and C5 is also meta, which satisfies the condition. So, {-CHO, -CN} are at {C3, C5}.\n\nNow we have two sets of ambiguities to resolve:\n1.  Is -OH at C2 and -N(CH3)2 at C6, or vice-versa?\n2.  Is -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5, or vice-versa?\n\nWe can use the final piece of information to resolve this:\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. The nitrile group (-CN) must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The alcohol group (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   **Scenario A:** If -CN is at **C3**, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the -OH group to be ortho to it, it must be at C2 (since C4 is already occupied by -OCH3).\n        *   **Scenario B:** If -CN is at **C5**, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For the -OH group to be ortho to it, it must be at C6 (since C4 is occupied).\n\nThis gives us two possible structures:\n\n*   **Structure from Scenario A:**\n    *   -CN is at C3. This means -CHO is at C5.\n    *   -OH is at C2. This means -N(CH3)2 is at C6.\n    *   **Final Structure 1:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n*   **Structure from Scenario B:**\n    *   -CN is at C5. This means -CHO is at C3.\n    *   -OH is at C6. This means -N(CH3)2 is at C2.\n    *   **Final Structure 2:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nBoth structures have substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` in both cases. When the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker rule: **the numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent cited first in the name (i.e., first in alphabetical order).**\n\nFirst, let's list the substituents alphabetically. (Note: \"dimethylamino\" is alphabetized under 'd').\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nNow, let's check the locant of the first alphabetical substituent ('cyano') in our two possible structures:\n*   In **Structure 1**, the 'cyano' group is at position **3**.\n*   In **Structure 2**, the 'cyano' group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 < 5, IUPAC rules dictate that we must choose the numbering scheme that results in **Structure 1**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants.\n*   Parent: **benzoic acid**\n*   Substituents (alphabetized):\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these parts gives the full IUPAC name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived name with the given options:\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the description into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Parent structure**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Principal group**: The problem mentions a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n*   **Main group positions**: The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all *meta* to one another. Starting with -COOH at C1, the *meta* positions are C3 and C5. So, the -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5.\n*   **Other substituent positions (relative to -COOH at C1)**:\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group is *ortho* (C2 or C6).\n    *   A dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group is *ortho* (C2 or C6). So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 occupy the C2 and C6 positions.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (C4).\n\nThis gives us a basic framework:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (one on each)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (one on each)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **Final constraint to determine the exact structure**: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) must be *ortho* to both -OCH3 (at C4) and -OH.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        1.  **If -CN is at C3**: To be *ortho* to -OCH3 at C4 is correct. To be *ortho* to -OH, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n        2.  **If -CN is at C5**: To be *ortho* to -OCH3 at C4 is correct. To be *ortho* to -OH, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nThis means the description is ambiguous and describes two different constitutional isomers. Let's draw both possibilities and see how the IUPAC naming rules apply.\n\n*   **Molecule A (from possibility 1)**:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n*   **Molecule B (from possibility 2)**:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe primary rule is to give the principal functional group (-COOH) the locant C1. Then, we number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the other substituents. In both molecules A and B, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so the locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nWhen the locant set is the same, we use a tie-breaker: number the ring to give the lowest locant to the substituent that appears first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**:\n    *   **C**yano (-CN)\n    *   **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**.\n\n*   **Naming Molecule A**:\n    *   Numbering clockwise: The cyano group is at C3.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise: The cyano group is at C5.\n    *   Since 3 < 5, we must use the **clockwise** numbering for Molecule A.\n    *   The locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\n*   **Naming Molecule B**:\n    *   Numbering clockwise: The cyano group is at C5.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise: The cyano group is at C3.\n    *   Since 3 < 5, we must use the **counter-clockwise** numbering for Molecule B.\n    *   The locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\nSurprisingly, applying the strict IUPAC numbering rules results in the exact same set of locants for both distinct molecules.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Full IUPAC Name\n\nWe assemble the name by listing the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its determined locant, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\nUsing the locants derived above for both molecules:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n*   Parent: benzoic acid\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: not alphabetical)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Matches our derived name**)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: not alphabetical)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: this uses a non-preferred numbering scheme)\n\nAlthough the initial description was ambiguous, applying the IUPAC rules systematically leads to a single correct name, which is option B. Both possible interpretations of the structure yield the same IUPAC name.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description\n\n*   **C1**: -COOH (by definition)\n*   **Para to carboxylic acid (C1) is a methoxy group**: The para position is C4. So, **C4** has a **-OCH3** (methoxy) group.\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid (C1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **C2** and **C6** have **-OH** (hydroxyl) and **-N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino) groups, one at each position.\n*   **Meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) are a carbaldehyde and a cyano group**: The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **C3** and **C5** have **-CHO** (formyl) and **-CN** (cyano) groups, one at each position.\n\nAt this point, the ring looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n### 3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Positions\n\n*   The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at **C4**.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must be at C2 or C6.\n\n*   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This configuration works.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This configuration also works.\n\n*   This gives us two possible structures, which are mirror images of each other depending on the numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1 (Clockwise numbering):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2 (Counter-clockwise numbering):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure/Numbering\n\n*   IUPAC rules state that we must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). In this case, both numbering directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise) result in the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Tie-breaker rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we assign the lowest numbers to the substituents that appear first alphabetically.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically (prefixes like 'di-' are ignored for alphabetization):\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Now, compare the locants for the first substituent in the alphabetical list ('cyano') in both structures:\n    *   In the first structure (clockwise numbering), **cyano** is at position **3**.\n    *   In the second structure (counter-clockwise numbering), **cyano** is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the first structure (clockwise numbering) is the correct one according to IUPAC rules.\n\n### 5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name\n\n*   Using the correct structure (Case 1), we list the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl**\n    *   **2-hydroxy**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n*   Combining these gives the full name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetization.\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name exactly.**\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This is the name for the incorrectly numbered structure.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Describes the incorrect structure and is not alphabetized.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule:**\n    The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano (-CN), a hydroxyl (-OH), a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy (-OCH3) group attached to a benzene ring.\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom on the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents based on the Description:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl as a prefix)** and **cyano (-CN)** are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are also *meta* to each other. If one is at C3 and the other is at C5, they are indeed meta to one another (separated by C4).\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH, or hydroxy)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3)** is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   So far, we know: C1 is -COOH, C4 is -OCH3. The pairs {-CHO, -CN} are at {C3, C5} and {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure:**\n    The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n        *   Is the methoxy group at C4 ortho to C3? Yes.\n        *   Is the hydroxyl group ortho to C3? The hydroxyl must be at C2 or C6. C2 is ortho to C3, while C6 is para to C3. For the condition to be met, the hydroxyl group **must be at C2**.\n        *   This arrangement satisfies all conditions. It implies the dimethylamino is at C6 and the carbaldehyde is at C5.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n        *   Is the methoxy group at C4 ortho to C5? Yes.\n        *   Is the hydroxyl group ortho to C5? The hydroxyl must be at C2 or C6. C6 is ortho to C5, while C2 is para to C5. For the condition to be met, the hydroxyl group **must be at C6**.\n        *   This arrangement also satisfies all conditions. It implies the dimethylamino is at C2 and the carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Two Possible Structures:**\n    We have two potential structures that fit the description:\n    *   **Structure I (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n    *   **Structure II (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n    The first IUPAC rule is to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Locant set for Structure I: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n    *   Locant set for Structure II: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we must use the tie-breaker rule.\n\n    **Tie-breaker rule:** When numbering choices remain, assign the lowest numbers to the substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n    First, list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n    1.  Cyano\n    2.  Dimethylamino\n    3.  Formyl\n    4.  Hydroxy\n    5.  Methoxy\n\n    Now, compare the locant for the first group in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\") in both structures:\n    *   In Structure I, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n    *   In Structure II, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure I is the correct one according to IUPAC rules.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using Structure I, we list the substituents with their locants in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   **C**yano: 3-cyano\n    *   **D**imethylamino: 6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   **F**ormyl: 5-formyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy: 2-hydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy: 4-methoxy\n\n    Combining them alphabetically gives:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n6.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    The derived name matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Parent Structure\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**. By IUPAC convention, the carbon atom to which the carboxylic acid group is attached is designated as carbon number 1 (C1).\n\n### Step 2: Place the Substituents based on Given Positions\nLet's build the structure around the C1-COOH group.\n*   **Para (C4) substituent:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it must be at position C4.\n*   **Ortho (C2/C6) substituents:** A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions C2 and C6.\n*   **Meta (C3/C5) substituents:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as the \"formyl\" prefix) and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions C3 and C5.\n\nSo far, the basic layout is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C2 & C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3 & C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n\n### Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is fixed at C4.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: The cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   For the methoxy group (at C4) to be ortho to it, this condition is met (C3 and C4 are adjacent).\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to it, the -OH must be at C2 (since C4 is taken by methoxy).\n    *   This defines the structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n*   **Case 2: The cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   For the methoxy group (at C4) to be ortho to it, this condition is met (C4 and C5 are adjacent).\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to it, the -OH must be at C6 (since C4 is taken by methoxy).\n    *   This defines the structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C3, must have the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\nYou'll notice that the structures from Case 1 and Case 2 are the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). The task now is to determine the correct IUPAC numbering.\n\n### Step 4: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe main functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We number the ring to give the lowest possible set of numbers (locants) to the substituents.\n\n*   **Numbering A (from Case 1):** Substituents are at 2(-OH), 3(-CN), 4(-OCH3), 5(-CHO), 6(-N(CH3)2). The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Numbering B (from Case 2):** Substituents are at 2(-N(CH3)2), 3(-CHO), 4(-OCH3), 5(-CN), 6(-OH). The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering schemes produce the exact same locant set, we must use a tie-breaking rule. The rule states: **If a choice remains, assign the lowest number to the substituent group that is cited first in the name (i.e., the one that comes first alphabetically).**\n\n### Step 5: Alphabetize the Substituents\nLet's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order. Note that prefixes like \"di-\", \"tri-\", etc., are ignored for simple substituents.\n1.  **C**yano (-CN)\n2.  **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2) --- 'd' is used for alphabetization\n3.  **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **Cyano**. Now we compare the two numbering schemes based on the locant given to the \"cyano\" group.\n\n*   In **Numbering A**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In **Numbering B**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Numbering A is the correct IUPAC numbering scheme.**\n\n### Step 6: Assemble the Final Name\nWe use the locants from the correct numbering scheme (Numbering A) and list the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **Correct Locants:** 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n*   **Alphabetical Assembly:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\nFirst, we list all the functional groups present on the benzene ring:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, referred to as the 'formyl' group when a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules for priority of functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as locant number 1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   One of {C2, C6} is -OH (hydroxyl).\n    *   The other of {C2, C6} is -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this condition is satisfied.\n    *   One of {C3, C5} is -CHO (formyl).\n    *   The other of {C3, C5} is -CN (cyano).\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile group is -CN.\n    *   We know methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The -CN group must be ortho to C4, which means the -CN group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group's position:\n        *   **Scenario A: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C6.\n        *   **Scenario B: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C2.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Numbering (Lowest Locant Rule)**\n\nWe now have two possible structures that fit the description. The next step is to number the ring according to IUPAC rules to decide which structure is correct. The primary rule is to assign numbers to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\nIn both scenarios, the substituents are located at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since this set of locants is the same for both possibilities, we have a tie.\nThe tie-breaking rule states that when a choice exists, numbering should be assigned to give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent names alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**. Therefore, the numbering should be chosen to give the 'cyano' group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). Since 3 is lower than 5, the cyano group must be at **C3**.\n\nThis confirms **Scenario B** is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Structure**\n\nBased on our deductions, the positions are:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (Since -CN is at C3, -OH must be at C2 to be ortho to it)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Gets the lower number, 3, based on alphabetization)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3\n*   **C5:** -CHO (The other meta position for the remaining group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (The other ortho position for the remaining group)\n\n**5. Construct the IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)** (The parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name perfectly matches option B. Let's verify the other options:\n*   A) Not alphabetized correctly.\n*   C) This name corresponds to our rejected \"Scenario A\" where cyano is at C5, violating the lowest locant rule for alphabetically first substituent.\n*   D) Not alphabetized correctly.\n\nThus, the only correct IUPAC name based on the description and rules is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, I will break down the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Base Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all *meta* to one another. The simplest way to draw this is to place the main group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. Then, the other two groups would be at positions 3 and 5 to satisfy the *meta* relationship (1,3- and 1,5- relationships are meta; 3,5- is also meta).\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n\n2.  **Add Substituents Relative to the Carboxylic Acid:**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't know which is which yet.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH3). The para position is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguity:**\n    *   The description states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy (-OCH3) group at C4, which is consistent with this statement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho-to-COOH position, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group.\n\nThe final structure is now unambiguously determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 2. Determine the Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\n*   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned **locant 1**.\n*   We need to number the remaining positions (2 through 6) to give the lowest possible set of locants to the other substituents. We can number either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Numbering clockwise:** Substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** Starting from C1, C6 would become C2, C5 would become C3, etc. The substituents would still be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   Since both directions yield the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we assign numbering to give the lowest locants to substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize the Substituents\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them. Note that when naming, the carbaldehyde group (-CHO) is named \"formyl\" and the nitrile group (-CN) is named \"cyano\".\n*   -CN: **c**yano\n*   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n*   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n*   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n*   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n\nThe alphabetical order is: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n\n### 5. Apply the Numbering Tie-Breaker\n\nNow, let's compare the two numbering schemes based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\".\n\n*   **Clockwise Numbering:** Based on our drawing, the -N(CH3)2 is at C2 and the **-CN is at C5**.\n*   **Counter-clockwise Numbering:** The -OH would be at C2 and the **-CN would be at C3**.\n\nSince **3 is lower than 5**, the counter-clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct locants for each substituent are:\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)**\n\n### 6. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, and finish with the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano-\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)-\n3.  5-formyl-\n4.  2-hydroxy-\n5.  4-methoxy-\n6.  benzoic acid\n\nCombining these in the correct order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 7. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   D) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** (Matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a model of the molecule.\n-   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n-   **Highest Priority Group:** The problem lists a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which, according to IUPAC rules, is the highest priority among the given functional groups. This means the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n-   **Substituent Positions relative to C1 (-COOH):**\n    -   *ortho* (C2 and C6): one hydroxyl (-OH) group and one dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n    -   *para* (C4): one methoxy (-OCH₃) group.\n-   **Meta-related groups:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* to one another. This means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n-   **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH₃) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrile/cyano group (-CN).\n\nLet's use this information to determine the exact position of each substituent.\n1.  Place -COOH at **C1**.\n2.  Place -OCH₃ at **C4** (para to C1).\n3.  The -CHO and -CN groups are at **C3** and **C5**.\n4.  The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at **C2** and **C6**.\n5.  Now use the final constraint: -OCH₃ (at C4) and -OH are ortho to -CN.\n    -   The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So -CN must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C3**. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C5**. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nWe have two potential arrangements which are actually the same molecule, just numbered differently from C1:\n-   **Arrangement A (Numbering Counter-Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n-   **Arrangement B (Numbering Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the remaining carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n-   In both Arrangement A and Arrangement B, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n-   When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's compare the two numbering arrangements based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\":\n-   In Arrangement A (counter-clockwise), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n-   In Arrangement B (clockwise), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering of Arrangement A is correct.\n\nSo, the correct assignment of substituents is:\n-   C1: -COOH\n-   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n-   C3: -CN (cyano)\n-   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n-   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n-   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Assemble the Final Name\n\nTo write the final IUPAC name, list the substituents (with their locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for clarity with complex/substituted substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts alphabetically gives the name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\n\n-   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n-   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but prefixes are listed numerically, not alphabetically.*\n-   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *This exactly matches our derived name.*\n-   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.*\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem requires a systematic approach to IUPAC nomenclature. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Identify Substituents and the Parent Ring\n*   **Parent Ring**: Benzene\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents**:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as a 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as a 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as a 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the functional groups are ranked as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule a **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring\n\n1.  **Assign C1**: The carbon atom attached to the principal group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Place the other groups based on the description**:\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Methoxy (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the final clue to fix the positions**:\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\".\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C5, its ortho positions would be C4 and C6.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C3, its ortho positions would be C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states that both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. This is only possible if the **nitrile (-CN) is at C3**, which puts the **hydroxyl (-OH) at C2**.\n\n4.  **Finalize the Structure**:\n    *   **C1**: -COOH\n    *   **C2**: -OH (ortho to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C3**: -CN (meta to -COOH and ortho to -OCH₃ and -OH)\n    *   **C4**: -OCH₃ (para to -COOH and ortho to -CN)\n    *   **C5**: This leaves the remaining meta position for the carbaldehyde (-CHO).\n    *   **C6**: This leaves the remaining ortho position for the dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n\n    The structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n\n    This structure and numbering scheme satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 4. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Alphabetize the prefixes**: The prefixes must be listed in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n2.  **Combine prefixes with their locants and the parent name**:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are often used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This exactly matches our derived name.\n*   B) This option uses incorrect numbering.\n*   C) This option incorrectly orders the substituents numerically instead of alphabetically.\n*   D) This option uses incorrect locants.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a structural representation of the molecule. We will use a temporary numbering system on a benzene ring to place the groups, which may not be the final IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   **Core structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* (1,3-positions) to one another. Let's place the primary functional group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. This means the other two groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -CHO at C3\n    *   -CN at C5\n\n    ```\n        (C1)-COOH\n       /      \\\n     C6        C2\n    /          \\\n   (C5)-CN -- C4 -- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* (1,2-positions) to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (1,4-position) to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n\n    Let's update the drawing with this information:\n    ```\n          (C1)-COOH\n         /         \\\n    (C6)-(OH/NMe2) (C2)-(NMe2/OH)\n      |                |\n    (C5)-CN -------- (C4)-OCH3 -------- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Final positioning clue:** The methoxy group and the alcohol group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile group (-CN).\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The positions *ortho* to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is already at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This confirms its placement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This forces the remaining dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group to be at C2.\n\n**The final, unambiguous structure is:**\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**2. Determine the Parent Compound and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The IUPAC priority of functional groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so the parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) must be assigned locant 1 (C1).\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-NMe2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-NMe2. The locant set for the substituents is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**3. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Alphabetize the substituents:**\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino\n    3.  **F**ormyl (the prefix for a -CHO group when it's not the principal group)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the tie-breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C5.\n    *   Clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **we must use the clockwise numbering scheme**.\n\n*   **Assign the correct locants based on clockwise numbering:**\n    *   **hydroxy** is at C2\n    *   **cyano** is at C3\n    *   **methoxy** is at C4\n    *   **formyl** is at C5\n    *   **dimethylamino** is at C6\n\n*   **Construct the name:** List the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**4.

It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has the highest priority among the given functional groups according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents based on the description:**\n    Let's denote the positions on the benzene ring from 1 to 6, starting with the carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\n    *   \"A carboxylic acid (at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all meta to one another.\"\n        *   The 'meta' positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, they must be arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern.\n        *   So, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups are at positions **C3 and C5**.\n\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2).\"\n        *   The 'ortho' positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6.\n        *   So, the **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino** groups are at positions **C2 and C6**.\n\n    *   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3).\"\n        *   The 'para' position relative to C1 is C4.\n        *   So, the **methoxy (-OCH3)** group is at position **C4**.\n\n    At this point, the ring is fully substituted, but we have pairs of substituents in undecided positions: {-OH, -N(CH3)2} at {C2, C6} and {-CHO, -CN} at {C3, C5}.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Positions:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n        *   The methoxy group is fixed at **C4**. For the nitrile (-CN) to be ortho to it, the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile. This is the key to solving the puzzle. Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile:\n            *   **Scenario 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the alcohol **(-OH) must be at C2**.\n            *   **Scenario 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the alcohol **(-OH) must be at C6**.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Scenarios:**\n    The primary IUPAC rule for numbering a ring is to assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents. In this case, the substituent locants are fixed at {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, regardless of the scenario. When the locant set is identical, we use a tie-breaker: we number the ring to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   The rule requires that 'cyano' gets the lowest possible locant. The available positions for the cyano group are C3 and C5. To minimize its locant, the **cyano group must be placed at C3**.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Structure:**\n    *   Since the cyano group is at C3, we must follow **Scenario 1** from step 3.\n    *   From Scenario 1, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2.\n    *   This forces the remaining substituents into their unique positions:\n        *   The dimethylamino group must be at C6 (the other ortho position).\n        *   The formyl group must be at C5 (the other meta position).\n\n    The definitive structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\n6.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now, write the full name by listing the substituent prefixes (with their determined locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\n    Combining these gives the final name:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect, substituents are not alphabetized)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect, uses the wrong numbering)\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect, uses the wrong numbering)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem requires us to systematically determine the structure of a substituted benzene molecule based on a detailed description and then correctly name it according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde / Formyl (-CHO)\n*   Cyano / Nitrile (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl / Alcohol (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of Substituents**\n\nWe are given the relative positions of all substituents. Let's place them on the benzene ring, starting with C1 for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **Para (to C1):** A methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4: -OCH3**\n*   **Meta (to C1):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. The problem also states they are meta to each other, which C3 and C5 are. So, {C3, C5} must be {-CHO, -CN}.\n*   **Ortho (to C1):** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {C2, C6} must be {-OH, -N(CH3)2}.\n*   **Key Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) must be ortho to it, so the -CN group must be at either C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   **Case 1: -CN is at C3.** It is ortho to C4 (-OCH3). For the -OH group to be ortho to it, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    *   **Case 2: -CN is at C5.** It is ortho to C4 (-OCH3). For the -OH group to be ortho to it, the -OH group must be at C6. This also seems to work.\n\n**3. Resolve the Ambiguity using IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nAt first glance, it seems two different molecules could fit the description. However, the IUPAC naming system is designed to give a unique name to every molecule, which includes a specific numbering scheme.\n\n*   The principal group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   The locants for the substituents will be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the arrangement. This creates a tie in the \"lowest locant set\" rule.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant set is a tie, we number the ring in the direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **cyano**\n2.  **dimethylamino**\n3.  **formyl** (the name for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n4.  **hydroxy**\n5.  **methoxy**\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must number the ring to give the cyano group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). The correct numbering must assign the **C3** position to the cyano group.\n\nWith this rule, the structure is now uniquely determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C3:** -CN (to satisfy the numbering rule)\n*   **C2:** -OH (must be ortho to C3 based on the \"key constraint\")\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (para to C1)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (the other meta group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n\nLet's verify this final structure against all statements:\n*   -COOH, -CHO (C5), -CN (C3) are all meta to one another. (Correct)\n*   -OH (C2) and -N(CH3)2 (C6) are ortho to -COOH. (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) is para to -COOH. (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) and -OH (C2) are both ortho to -CN (C3). (Correct)\n\nThe structure is confirmed.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we list the substituents (in alphabetical order) with their determined locants, followed by the parent name.\n\n*   cyano -> 3-cyano\n*   dimethylamino -> 6-(dimethylamino)\n*   formyl -> 5-formyl\n*   hydroxy -> 2-hydroxy\n*   methoxy -> 4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n\nOur derived name is a perfect match for option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThe user wants the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene ring.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:**\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, which has the highest priority among the given functional groups (carboxylic acid > aldehyde > nitrile > alcohol > amine > ether). Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the number **1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information:**\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring starting from C1 (the -COOH group).\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Para means position 4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": Ortho means positions 2 and 6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at **C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is which.\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Meta means positions 3 and 5. The carboxylic acid is at C1. Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as \"formyl\") and the cyano (-CN) groups are at **C3 and C5**. We also don't know which is which. The meta relationship is confirmed: C1 is meta to C3 and C5; C3 is meta to C5.\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) is at either C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the position of the nitrile:\n        *   **Case A:** If the nitrile is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the statement to be true, the methoxy group must be at C4 (which it is) and the alcohol group must be at C2. This works.\n        *   **Case B:** If the nitrile is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For the statement to be true, the methoxy group must be at C4 (which it is) and the alcohol group must be at C6. This also works.\n\n**3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Break the Tie:**\nThe description successfully describes two distinct molecules. IUPAC rules dictate that when such ambiguity arises, we must choose the numbering that gives the lowest set of locants to the substituents cited alphabetically.\n\n*   The substituents are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n*   The set of locant numbers is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both potential structures. This rule doesn't resolve the tie.\n*   Therefore, we must apply the next rule: assign the lowest numbers to substituents in alphabetical order at the first point of difference.\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n\nLet's analyze the two possible structures derived from Case A and Case B:\n\n*   **Structure from Case A:**\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -OH at C2 (ortho to CN)\n    *   -CN at C3\n    *   -OCH3 at C4\n    *   -CHO at C5 (the other meta position)\n    *   -N(CH3)2 at C6 (the other ortho position)\n    *   **Locants in alphabetical order**: cyano (**3**), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxy (2), methoxy (4).\n    *   The locant set is **3, 6, 5, 2, 4**.\n\n*   **Structure from Case B:**\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -OH at C6 (ortho to CN)\n    *   -CN at C5\n    *   -OCH3 at C4\n    *   -CHO at C3 (the other meta position)\n    *   -N(CH3)2 at C2 (the other ortho position)\n    *   **Locants in alphabetical order**: cyano (**5**), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4).\n    *   The locant set is **5, 2, 3, 6, 4**.\n\n*   **Comparison:** We compare the two locant sets: (**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4) vs (**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4). At the first point of difference, **3 is lower than 5**. Therefore, the numbering from Case A is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Name:**\nUsing the substituent positions from Case A and listing them in alphabetical order:\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid** (parent name)\n\nCombining these gives the final name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and draw the structure:**\n    *   We start with a benzene ring.\n    *   The molecule has a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group, all *meta* to one another. This suggests a 1,3,5 substitution pattern for these three groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority for IUPAC naming, so we assign its position as C1. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   There is a methoxy group (-OCH3) *para* to the carboxylic acid, which places it at C4.\n    *   There is a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group, both *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This places them at C2 and C6.\n    *   Finally, we use the constraints relative to the nitrile (cyano group) to determine the exact arrangement:\n        *   The methoxy group (at C4) is *ortho* to the nitrile. This is true if the nitrile is at C3 or C5.\n        *   The hydroxyl group (alcohol) is also *ortho* to the nitrile.\n            *   **Scenario A:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C2 to be *ortho* to it. This leaves C5 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C6 for the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n            *   **Scenario B:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6 to be *ortho* to it. This leaves C3 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C2 for the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n2.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\n    *   The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n    *   In both Scenario A and Scenario B, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of which direction we number (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the set of locants is the same, we number the ring to give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n3.  **List and Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   -CN: **c**yano\n    *   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n    *   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n    *   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n    *   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n    The alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Numbering:**\n    *   Let's check our two scenarios against the tie-breaker rule. The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   In **Scenario A**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In **Scenario B**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scenario A** provides the correct numbering.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    *   The correct structure and numbering (from Scenario A) is:\n        *   C1: -COOH (benzoic acid)\n        *   C2: -OH (2-hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (3-cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (4-methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (5-formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (6-dimethylamino)\n    *   Now, we arrange the substituent names in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combining these alphabetically gives the prefix: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy**\n    *   Adding the parent name, the full IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   This name matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Structure:**\n    The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano (-CN), a hydroxyl (-OH), a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy (-OCH3) group on a benzene ring.\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    We will use the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring relative to C1.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH3):** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". This places the methoxy group at C4.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** \"meta to one another\" and both are \"meta to the carboxylic acid\". This means these three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since COOH is at C1, the CHO and CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups:** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". This places these two groups at C2 and C6.\n\n    At this point, we have the basic layout:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   {C2, C6}: one is -OH, the other is -N(CH3)2\n    *   {C3, C5}: one is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure:**\n    The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   Alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   Nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the position of the nitrile group:\n    *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The methoxy group (at C4) is indeed ortho to C3.

Let's see how they are named according to IUPAC rules. The primary rule after fixing C1 is to number the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents. Since all other positions (2,3,4,5,6) are substituted, the locant set will be {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of direction. In this situation, we use alphabetical order to break the tie. We give the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n    The substituents to consider are **d**imethylamino and **h**ydroxy at the C2/C6 positions.\n    *   Since 'd' comes before 'h' alphabetically, the **dimethylamino** group must be assigned the lower locant.\n\n    Let's analyze both structures based on this rule:\n    *   **Naming for Structure from Case 1:** The groups at C2/C6 are -OH (C2) and -N(CH3)2 (C6). To give dimethylamino the lower locant, we must number counter-clockwise, which would make the -N(CH3)2 group C2 and the -OH group C6. This renumbering makes the structure identical to the structure derived in Case 2.\n    *   **Naming for Structure from Case 2:** The groups at C2/C6 are -N(CH3)2 (C2) and -OH (C6). The dimethylamino group already has the lower locant (2), so this numbering is correct.\n\n    Therefore, there is only one valid molecule once IUPAC rules are applied, and its structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    List the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locant number.\n    *   **C**yano: 5-cyano\n    *   **D**imethylamino: 2-(dimethylamino)\n    *   **F**ormyl: 3-formyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy: 6-hydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy: 4-methoxy\n\n    Combine these in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed alphabetically in the name.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetical order.\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant (position) **1**.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the Positional Information to Build the Structure**\nLet's map out the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting from C1 (-COOH).\n\n1.  **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and cyano (-CN, prefix \"cyano\") groups are at positions C3 and C5.\n\n2.  **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino...\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH, prefix \"hydroxy\") and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix \"dimethylamino\") groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n3.  **\"...and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   This means the methoxy (-OCH3, prefix \"methoxy\") group is at position C4.\n\n4.  **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key piece of information that determines the exact arrangement. The \"alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group, and the \"nitrile\" is the cyano group.\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   We have two possibilities from point 1: the cyano group is at C3 or C5.\n    *   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at C3, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The description says methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl must be ortho. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This leads to the following structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n    *   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. The description says methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl must be ortho. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This leads to the structure's other enantiomer (mirror image). For naming purposes, the constitution (connectivity) is what we need, and both cases describe the same constitution, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\nSo, the unique molecular constitution is established. Let's use the arrangement from Case A for the next step.\n*   C1: -COOH, C2: -OH, C3: -CN, C4: -OCH3, C5: -CHO, C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n**Step 3: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\nThe final name depends on the correct numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) to give the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n1.  The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n2.  All other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are substituted, so the locant set for the substituents as a whole is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of the numbering direction.\n3.  When there is a tie, we choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest locant set to the substituents when they are arranged in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n    *   Now, let's find the locant for each of these substituents for the two possible numbering directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) of our established structure.\n\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):**\n        *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino\n        *   Let's create the locant set based on the alphabetical order of prefixes:\n            *   cyano: 3\n            *   dimethylamino: 6\n            *   formyl: 5\n            *   hydroxy: 2\n            *   methoxy: 4\n        *   **Locant Set 1: [3, 6, 5, 2, 4]**\n\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-Clockwise):**\n        *   This direction would assign C2 to the dimethylamino group and C6 to the hydroxyl group, etc. The locants would be:\n        *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy\n        *   Let's create the locant set based on the alphabetical order of prefixes:\n            *   cyano: 5\n            *   dimethylamino: 2\n            *   formyl: 3\n            *   hydroxy: 6\n            *   methoxy: 4\n        *   **Locant Set 2: [5, 2, 3, 6, 4]**\n\n4.  Compare the two locant sets lexicographically (at the first point of difference).\n    *   Compare Locant Set 1 ([**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4]) with Locant Set 2 ([**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4]).\n    *   The first number in Set 1 is 3, and in Set 2 is 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Numbering Direction 1 is the correct one.**\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering (Numbering Direction 1), we assemble the full IUPAC name. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant.\n\n*   **c**yano is at C3 -> **3-cyano**\n*   **d**imethylamino is at C6 -> **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **f**ormyl is at C5 -> **5-formyl**\n*   **h**ydroxy is at C2 -> **2-hydroxy**\n*   **m**ethoxy is at C4 -> **4-methoxy**\n*   Parent name -> **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem requires the systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, also known as formyl as a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Positions of Substituents and Number the Ring\n\nWe are given the following positional information:\n1.  The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all **meta** to one another. Since the carboxylic acid is at C1, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at positions C3 and C5.\n2.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. This places them at positions C2 and C6.\n3.  The methoxy group is **para** to the carboxylic acid. This places it at position C4.\n4.  A crucial piece of information: The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group (at C2 or C6) are both **ortho** to the cyano group.\n    *   For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our first point.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group to be ortho to the cyano group, we must test the two possibilities:\n        *   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the methoxy is already at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\nThis gives us two possible structures for the substituents on the benzoic acid ring:\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from Case A):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from Case B):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Lowest Locant Rule\n\nBoth potential numbering schemes give the exact same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must use the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n### Step 4: Alphabetize Substituents and Select the Correct Numbering\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino (prefixes like 'di', 'tri' are not used for alphabetization unless they are part of a complex substituent name, but 'dimethylamino' is treated as a whole, starting with 'd')\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare our two structures based on the locant given to the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\":\n*   In Structure 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Structure 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1** represents the correct numbering scheme.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the Final IUPAC Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its locant number, and append the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining them in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, corresponds to Structure 2)\nB) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\nC) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\nD) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule:**\n    The functional groups present are carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde/formyl (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned the number 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    We will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the relative positions given in the question. Let's start drawing the structure with the C1 as the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, a methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The -COOH is at C1. The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, a formyl (-CHO) group and a cyano (-CN) group are at C3 and C5.\n    *   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: The nitrile (-CN) group must be ortho to both the methoxy group (-OCH3) and the hydroxyl/alcohol group (-OH).\n        *   We know -OCH3 is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   We also know the -OH group is at C2 or C6.\n        *   Let's test if the -CN group can be at C3. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. If -CN is at C3, then C4 (-OCH3) and C2 (-OH) must be the positions for the methoxy and hydroxyl groups. This fits our previous deductions perfectly.\n        *   Let's test if the -CN group can be at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. If -CN is at C5, then C4 (-OCH3) and C6 (-OH) must be the positions for the methoxy and hydroxyl groups. This also works.\n\n3.  **Establish the Final Structure and Numbering:**\n    We have two possible numbering schemes that describe the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions.\n    *   **Scheme 1**: -CN at C3. This leads to: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n    *   **Scheme 2**: -CN at C5. This leads to: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    Both schemes result in the same set of locants for the substituents: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When two numbering schemes yield the same lowest locant set, IUPAC rules state that the lowest number should be assigned to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   cyano\n    *   dimethylamino\n    *   formyl\n    *   hydroxy\n    *   methoxy\n\n    According to IUPAC rules, the prefix \"di\" in \"dimethylamino\" is included for alphabetization because it's part of a composite substituent name. Therefore, we alphabetize based on 'd'.\n    The correct alphabetical order is:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n5.  **Apply the Tie-breaker Rule and Finalize the Name:**\n    The first substituent in the alphabetical list is \"cyano\". To satisfy the tie-breaker rule, \"cyano\" must be given the lowest possible locant.\n    *   In Scheme 1, the cyano group is at C3.\n    *   In Scheme 2, the cyano group is at C5.\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Scheme 1**.\n\n    The correct positions for the substituents are:\n    *   C2: hydroxy\n    *   C3: cyano\n    *   C4: methoxy\n    *   C5: formyl\n    *   C6: dimethylamino\n\n    Now, we construct the final name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name.\n\n    3-cyano-6-dimethylamino-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n    This name matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify all groups and the parent structure:**\n    *   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   `-COOH` (carboxylic acid)\n        *   `-CHO` (carbaldehyde, named as \"formyl\" prefix)\n        *   `-CN` (cyano group/nitrile, named as \"cyano\" prefix)\n        *   `-OH` (hydroxyl group, named as \"hydroxy\" prefix)\n        *   `-N(CH3)2` (dimethylamino group)\n        *   `-OCH3` (methoxy group)\n\n2.  **Determine the principal functional group:**\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the `-COOH` group is assigned the number 1 (C1).\n\n3.  **Draw the structure by placing the substituents according to the description:**\n    *   Start with benzoic acid, placing the `-COOH` group at C1.\n    *   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" Meta positions are 1,3,5 relative to each other. With `-COOH` at C1, the `-CHO` and `-CN` groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position to C1 is C4. So, `-OCH3` is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, `-OH` and `-N(CH3)2` are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" This is the key constraint that fixes the relative positions. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   **Scenario 1:** Let's assume the nitrile (`-CN`) is at C3. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since `-OCH3` is at C4, the alcohol (`-OH`) must be at C2. This means `-N(CH3)2` must be at C6, and `-CHO` must be at C5.\n        *   **Scenario 2:** Let's assume the nitrile (`-CN`) is at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since `-OCH3` is at C4, the alcohol (`-OH`) must be at C6. This means `-N(CH3)2` must be at C2, and `-CHO` must be at C3.\n\n    Note that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 describe the exact same molecule, just viewed from different perspectives (they are mirror images that can be superimposed by rotation in the plane, as the molecule is achiral). Let's proceed with the structure from Scenario 1 to determine the name.\n\n    **Structure (based on Scenario 1):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n4.  **Number the ring according to IUPAC rules:**\n    *   The carbon with the `-COOH` group is C1.\n    *   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the other substituents. The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Numbering clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1 both result in the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   When the locant sets are identical, we must use alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes to decide the numbering direction. The direction that gives a lower number to the first point of difference in the alphabetical list of substituents is chosen.\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Let's check the two numbering directions for our determined structure:\n        *   **Direction A (Clockwise, as drawn):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2.\n        *   **Direction B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH.\n    *   Now, we create the locant sequences based on the alphabetical order of prefixes (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy):\n        *   **Sequence for Direction A:** {3, 6, 5, 2, 4}\n        *   **Sequence for Direction B:** {5, 2, 3, 6, 4}\n    *   Compare the sequences term by term: The first term of Sequence A is 3, and for Sequence B it is 5. Since 3 < 5, Direction A provides the lower locant set according to the rules.\n\n5.  **Construct the final name:**\n    *   Using the correct numbering from Direction A, the positions are:\n        *   `3-cyano`\n        *   `6-(dimethylamino)`\n        *   `5-formyl`\n        *   `2-hydroxy`\n        *   `4-methoxy`\n    *   Now, arrange these prefixes in alphabetical order and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   The correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived name matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Group:** Let's identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name and assign it to position 1 (C1). The functional groups are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**, and the -COOH group is on C1.\n3.  **Place Substituents based on relative positions to C1:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde, and cyano group are *meta* to one another. Meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are on C3 and C5.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is on C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are on C2 and C6.\n\n    At this point, the partial structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   Positions {C2, C6} have {-OH, -N(CH3)2}\n    *   Positions {C3, C5} have {-CHO, -CN}\n\n4.  **Use the final clue to determine the exact positions:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. The nitrile (-CN) must be in one of these positions.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **If -CN is at C5:** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4. This means the -OH group must be at C6. This works.\n        *   **If -CN is at C3:** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4. This means the -OH group must be at C2. This also works.\n\n    However, only one of these structures can be correct based on the fixed description. Let's re-read \"ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\". It seems there's no preference given. Ah, but wait, the description logically builds the molecule. Let's assume the final piece of information *uniquely* determines the structure.\n\n    Let's choose the C3 position for the Nitrile for our test.\n    *   If -CN is at C3. Then to satisfy the condition, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2 (since methoxy is at C4).\n    *   This places the remaining substituents: Since -OH is at C2, -N(CH3)2 must be at C6. Since -CN is at C3, -CHO must be at C5.\n\n    Let's check this final structure against all conditions:\n    *   **Structure:** C1: -COOH, C2: -OH, C3: -CN, C4: -OCH3, C5: -CHO, C6: -N(CH3)2\n    *   -COOH, -CHO (at 5), -CN (at 3) are all meta? Yes.\n    *   -OH (at 2) and -N(CH3)2 (at 6) are ortho to -COOH? Yes.\n    *   -OCH3 (at 4) is para to -COOH? Yes.\n    *   -OCH3 (at 4) and -OH (at 2) are ortho to -CN (at 3)? Yes.\n    \n    This structure perfectly and uniquely satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Correct Numbering\n\n1.  **Fixed Position:** C1 is assigned to the -COOH group.\n2.  **Numbering Direction:** We can number the ring clockwise or counter-clockwise. We must choose the direction that follows IUPAC rules.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C2=-OH, C3=-CN, C4=-OCH3, C5=-CHO, C6=-N(CH3)2. The set of locants (positions of substituents) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C2=-N(CH3)2, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH3, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. The set of locants is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaker Rule:** Since both numbering directions give the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituent names as a tie-breaker. The numbering that gives the lowest locant to the first substituent in alphabetical order is chosen.\n4.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker:**\n    *   The substituent prefixes, alphabetized, are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   Let's check the locant for \"cyano\" in each numbering scheme:\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering scheme is correct.**\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Numbering is set:** C1:-COOH, C2:-OH, C3:-CN, C4:-OCH3, C5:-CHO, C6:-N(CH3)2.\n2.  **Identify prefixes with locants:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-dimethylamino (parentheses are used for complex substituents like this)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n3.  **Arrange prefixes alphabetically:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n4.  **Combine with the parent name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect order of prefixes)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name perfectly)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Results from incorrect counter-clockwise numbering)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and ordering)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a systematic approach to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description to place the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n2.  **Highest Priority Group:** The highest priority functional group mentioned is the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this group defines the parent name as **benzoic acid** and the carbon it's attached to is designated as **C1**.\n3.  **Groups meta to each other:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl), and cyano (-CN) are all meta to one another. If -COOH is at C1, the other two must be at C3 and C5.\n4.  **Substituents relative to Carboxylic Acid (C1):**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This places them at C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n5.  **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (cyano, -CN) group.\n    *   \"Ortho to the nitrile\" means the substituents are on adjacent carbons to the carbon with the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the positions of -CN and -CHO (C3 and C5).\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are here. This fits perfectly, as the hydroxyl group must be at C2 (or C6). Therefore, the -OH group is at C2.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The description says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are here. This would place the -OH group at C6.\n\nBoth cases result in valid structures that are mirror images (enantiomers) of each other. However, IUPAC naming conventions will lead to a single, unambiguous name (ignoring stereochemistry, which is not specified). Let's proceed with the structure derived from Case A.\n\nThe resulting substitution pattern is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the problem description.\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** As established, it is **benzoic acid**.\n2.  **Numbering:** The carbon with the -COOH group is C1. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n    *   Numbering **clockwise** gives the locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Numbering **counter-clockwise** would mean C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, etc. This also gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n    *   Now, compare the two numbering directions based on the locant of the first substituent in this list ('cyano').\n        *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), **C3(-CN)**... 'Cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), **C5(-CN)**... 'Cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise** numbering scheme must be used.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name:** Using the clockwise numbering, we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants, followed by the parent name.\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n\nCombining them in alphabetical order yields:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.*\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and prefix order.*\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived IUPAC name.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule is a derivative of a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde/Formyl (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. The priority order for these groups is:\nCarboxylic acid > Cyano > Carbaldehyde > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.**\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, a **methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4**.\n\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.**\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a **hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at C2 and which is at C6.\n\n*   **A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.**\n    *   This implies a 1,3,5 substitution pattern. Since -COOH is at C1, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   **The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.**\n    *   This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile (-CN) group is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the position of the cyano group:\n\n    **Case A: The cyano (-CN) group is at C3.**\n    *   The substituents ortho to C3 are at C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   We already placed methoxy at C4, which is indeed ortho to C3. This is consistent.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group must be at the other ortho position, which is C2.\n    *   If -OH is at C2, then the dimethylamino group must be at C6 (as C2 and C6 have one of each).\n    *   If -CN is at C3, then the carbaldehyde (-CHO) must be at C5 (as C3 and C5 have one of each).\n\n    This leads to the following structure (Structure I):\n    *   **C1: -COOH**\n    *   **C2: -OH (hydroxy)**\n    *   **C3: -CN (cyano)**\n    *   **C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)**\n    *   **C5: -CHO (formyl)**\n    *   **C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)**\n\n    **Case B: The cyano (-CN) group is at C5.**\n    *   The substituents ortho to C5 are at C4 and C6.\n    *   The description states methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C5. Consistent.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n    *   This would place the dimethylamino group at C2 and the carbaldehyde at C3. This gives Structure II.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe have two potential structures (I and II) that fit the description. They are constitutional isomers. However, IUPAC rules provide a unique name. Let's analyze the numbering. C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\nThe substituents are at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} in both cases. When the set of locants is identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The lowest locants are assigned to the substituents cited first in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Now let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, gets in each numbering scheme.\n    *   In the numbering that gives **Structure I**, the **cyano** group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the numbering that gives **Structure II**, the **cyano** group is at **C5**.\n\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme that leads to **Structure I is the correct one.**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe use the correct structure (Structure I) and its numbering.\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents and positions:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nFinally, we arrange the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)\n3.  5-formyl\n4.  2-hydroxy\n5.  4-methoxy\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.*\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes in the name.*\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The core is a benzene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   Carboxylic acid: -COOH\n    *   Carbaldehyde: -CHO (named as a prefix 'formyl')\n    *   Cyano group: -CN (named as a prefix 'cyano')\n    *   Hydroxyl group: -OH (named as a prefix 'hydroxy')\n    *   Dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂ (named as a prefix 'dimethylamino')\n    *   Methoxy group: -OCH₃ (named as a prefix 'methoxy')\n\n**2. Determine the Principal Functional Group**\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, functional groups are ranked in priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether\nThe carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid.\n\n**3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We will build the structure on a benzene ring based on the relative positions given.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Assign C1.** The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Place the groups relative to C1.**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. Para is position 4 relative to C1. So, -OCH₃ is on C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are on C2 and C6 (we don't know which is where yet).\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. Meta positions are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are on C3 and C5 (again, we need more information to place them).\n\n*   **Step 3c: Use the final constraint to resolve ambiguity.**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   We know the methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   We know the alcohol (-OH) is at either C2 or C6.\n    *   We know the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. For this to be true, the alcohol must be at C2. This works perfectly.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol to be ortho to the nitrile, the alcohol must be at C6. This also works.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules.**\n    We have two potential numbering schemes which are mirror images of each other. We must number the ring starting from C1 to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n\n    *   **Scheme 1 (from Case 1):** Numbering clockwise gives:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CHO\n        *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    *   **Scheme 2 (from Case 2):** Numbering counter-clockwise gives:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   C3: -CHO\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    Since both numbering directions yield the same locant set, we use a tie-breaker rule: The numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**4. Alphabetize Substituents and Finalize Numbering**\n\n*   The substituent prefixes are: `cyano`, `dimethylamino`, `formyl`, `hydroxy`, `methoxy`.\n*   In alphabetical order:\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (alphabetized under 'd')\n    3.  **F**ormyl\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n*   Now we compare the locants for the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\":\n    *   In Scheme 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scheme 1 is the correct IUPAC numbering.**\n\nThe correct assignments are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\n**5.

According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Substituents and Their Prefixes:**\n    *   -CHO (carbaldehyde): **formyl**\n    *   -CN (cyano): **cyano**\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl): **hydroxy**\n    *   -N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino): **dimethylamino**\n    *   -OCH3 (methoxy): **methoxy**\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Substituents based on the Description:**\n    Let's place the parent -COOH group at C1 of the benzene ring.\n\n    *   *\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"*\n        This means these three groups are in a 1, 3, 5 relationship. With -COOH at C1, the formyl and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n    *   *\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino...\"*\n        The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n    *   *\"...and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"*\n        The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n\n    At this point, the skeleton is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   {C3, C5}: one is -CHO, one is -CN\n    *   {C2, C6}: one is -OH, one is -N(CH3)2\n\n4.  **Use the Final Clue to Resolve the Ambiguities:**\n    *   *\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"* (Note: alcohol = hydroxyl, nitrile = cyano).\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile group is either at C3 or C5. Let's test these two possibilities.\n\n    *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. For the clue to be true, the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group must be at C2 and C4. We know methoxy is at C4, which fits. This forces the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be at **C2**.\n        *   This leads to the following structure (let's call it **Structure A**):\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C2: -OH (as determined above)\n            *   C3: -CN (our assumption for this case)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (given as para to COOH)\n            *   C5: -CHO (the other meta position)\n            *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho position)\n        This structure is fully consistent with all parts of the description.\n\n    *   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. For the clue to be true, the methoxy and hydroxyl groups must be at C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, which fits. This forces the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be at **C6**.\n        *   This leads to the following structure (let's call it **Structure B**):\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho position)\n            *   C3: -CHO (the other meta position)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (given as para to COOH)\n            *   C5: -CN (our assumption for this case)\n            *   C6: -OH (as determined above)\n        This structure is also fully consistent with all parts of the description.\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Tie-Breaking Rules to Choose Between the Two Valid Structures:**\n    The descriptive text is ambiguous and describes two possible molecules (Structure A and Structure B). To determine the single correct name, we must apply IUPAC's tie-breaking rule for numbering. When there is a choice, we number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents when cited in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, list the substituents alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Now, we create the list of locants for these substituents for each structure.\n\n    *   **For Structure A:**\n        *   cyano is at **3**\n        *   dimethylamino is at **6**\n        *   formyl is at **5**\n        *   hydroxy is at **2**\n        *   methoxy is at **4**\n        *   Locant set (in alphabetical order of substituents): (3, 6, 5, 2, 4)\n\n    *   **For Structure B:**\n        *   cyano is at **5**\n        *   dimethylamino is at **2**\n        *   formyl is at **3**\n        *   hydroxy is at **6**\n        *   methoxy is at **4**\n        *   Locant set (in alphabetical order of substituents): (5, 2, 3, 6, 4)\n\n    *   Now, compare the two locant sets term by term: `(3, 6, 5, 2, 4)` vs `(5, 2, 3, 6, 4)`.\n    *   At the first point of difference (the first number in each set), `3` is less than `5`.\n    *   Therefore, the set of locants from **Structure A** is preferred. This means Structure A is the correct molecule to be named according to IUPAC rules.\n\n6.  **Write the Final IUPAC Name for Structure A:**\n    *   Structure A has the following substituents and positions: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The parent name is benzoic acid.\n    *   Arrange the substituents alphabetically in the name.\n    *   The correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Matches our derived name**)\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (This is the name for Structure B, which is disfavored by IUPAC rules)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the words into a chemical structure. Let's place the primary functional group, carboxylic acid, at position C1 of the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Principal Group:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Groups meta to each other:** The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano group (-CN) are all meta to one another. Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three to be mutually meta, they must be at positions C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the -COOH group. Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the -COOH group. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: One is -OH, the other is -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: One is -CN, the other is -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **Final Constraints (The key to solving the puzzle):** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with what we already know.\n    *   The alcohol group (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The -OH is at C2 or C6. Let's test the possibilities:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**, the ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the -OH group must be at C2 or C6, it must be at **C2** to be ortho to the -CN at C3.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**, the ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the -OH group must be at C2 or C6, it must be at **C6** to be ortho to the -CN at C5.\n\nThis seems to create two possible structures. However, IUPAC naming conventions will resolve this. The rules require us to number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to substituents, with ties broken by alphabetical order of the substituent names.\n\nLet's prioritize the numbering based on alphabetical order of the prefixes: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy. The prefix 'cyano' comes first alphabetically. Therefore, the cyano group should be assigned the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). The lowest number is 3.\n\nThis forces the following placements:\n*   The **-CN** group must be at **C3**.\n*   This implies the **-CHO** group is at **C5**.\n*   Since -CN is at C3, the -OH group must be at the ortho position **C2**.\n*   This implies the **-N(CH3)2** group is at **C6**.\n\nSo, the definitive structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the description.\n\n### 2. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\nNow we assemble the name based on this structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid\n2.  **Substituents and their locants:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino) (parentheses are used for complex substituent names)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n3.  **Alphabetize the prefixes:** The prefixes are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy.\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n4.  **Combine:** Combine the alphabetized prefixes before the parent name.\n\nThe final name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering (it would arise from numbering clockwise, which violates the lowest-locant rule for alphabetical prefixes).\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - The prefixes are not listed in alphabetical order.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - The prefixes are not listed in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, followed by an analysis of the provided candidate answers to find the most consistent choice.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Correct IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), and methoxy (-OCH₃). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the functional group priority is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\n    Therefore, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the principal functional group. The molecule is named as a derivative of **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure from the Description:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given relative positions.\n    *   **Para to -COOH (C4):** a methoxy group (-OCH₃).\n    *   **Ortho to -COOH (C2, C6):** a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n    *   **Meta to -COOH (C3, C5):** a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group and a cyano (-CN) group. The statement \"all meta to one another\" confirms the 1,3,5-relationship for these three groups.\n    *   **Final Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (alcohol = hydroxyl, nitrile = cyano). This is the key to determining the exact arrangement.\n\n3.  **Resolve Ambiguities using the Final Constraint:**\n    *   We know -OCH₃ is at C4, and -CN is at C3 or C5. This satisfies the \"methoxy is ortho to nitrile\" part.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), we must test the two possibilities for the -CN position:\n        *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at **C2**.\n        *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Arrangement:**\n    *   We now have two potential arrangements of substituents on the ring, which correspond to the two directions of numbering (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) from C1. Both arrangements have substituents at all positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so the locant set is identical.\n    *   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are the same, we number the ring to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n    *   First, we alphabetize the substituent prefixes: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The first substituent in the list is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5).\n    *   The rule dictates that \"cyano\" should be at **C3**. This corresponds to Case 1.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Structure:**\n    With \"cyano\" at C3, the structure is uniquely determined as:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n6.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    We list the substituents with their correct locants in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   **3-c**yano-\n    *   **6-(d**imethylamino)-\n    *   **5-f**ormyl-\n    *   **2-h**ydroxy-\n    *   **4-m**ethoxy\n    The correct name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\nI have now derived the correct name from first principles. This name matches option C from the provided list:\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   **C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nLet me review the candidate answers to select the most consistent one. I will check if their reasoning leads to the correct name (option C) and if they correctly identify it.\n\n*   **Consistency Check:** After reviewing all provided answer explanations, there is a strong consensus on the reasoning process:\n    1.  The parent compound is benzoic acid.\n    2.  Applying the locational clues leads to two possible structures.\n    3.  Applying the alphabetical tie-breaker rule (\"cyano\" is first alphabetically and should get the lowest number, 3) selects the correct numbering scheme.\n    4.  This scheme corresponds to the structure with {2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino} substituents.\n    5.  The correct name requires alphabetizing these prefixes: `3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid`.\n\n*   **Conclusion Matching:** Many of the provided methods correctly follow this logical chain and arrive at the name string **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. They then correctly match this name to option C. For example, Answers 2, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 26, 28, 36, 43, 46, 57, and 58 all conclude that the derived name matches option C. Other answers derive the same correct name but incorrectly match it to another letter, or derive an incorrect name due to misapplying a rule.\n\nThe reasoning that leads to option C is sound and is the most consistently applied method across the board.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this is the principal functional group, and the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO) is named as a **formyl** group.\n    *   Cyano (-CN) is named as a **cyano** group.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH) is named as a **hydroxy** group.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂) is named as a **(dimethylamino)** group.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃) is named as a **methoxy** group.\n\n### 2. Draw the Structure Based on Positional Information\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring, starting with the principal functional group at C1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (This defines the parent benzoic acid).\n\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it, meaning the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C2 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C6) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (ortho), which is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at C6 (ortho).\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to C1 (which is C2) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   And the remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the formyl group.\n    *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\nBoth structures fully satisfy the description. Fortunately, as we will see, IUPAC rules lead to the same name for both. Let's name Structure I.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n*   Numbering starts at C1. We can number clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   The set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both directions.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we number in the direction that gives the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n*   Now, let's write the sequence of locants for this alphabetical list for both numbering directions:\n    *   **CW Numbering (2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂):**\n        *   Cyano is at 3.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 6.\n        *   Formyl is at 5.\n        *   Hydroxy is at 2.\n        *   Methoxy is at 4.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n    *   **CCW Numbering (2-N(CH₃)₂, 3-CHO, 4-OCH₃, 5-CN, 6-OH):**\n        *   Cyano is at 5.\n        *   Dimethylamino is at 2.\n        *   ...and so on.\n        *   The locant sequence is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n*   We compare the two sequences term by term: {**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4} vs {**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4}. Since 3 is lower than 5, the first sequence is preferred.\n*   Therefore, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct (CW) numbering, the locants are:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nList these alphabetically to construct the final name:\n3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A. (If we were to name Structure II, the same procedure would also lead to this exact name, as the counter-clockwise direction would be chosen).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituent Positions:** Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, with the -COOH group at C1.\n\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't yet know which is where.\n    *   **\"a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: This means the carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguities:** The final piece of information is: **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) can be at C3 or C5.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C5, it must be at C6.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C6.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C2) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C3) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure I**: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   The methoxy group at C4 is indeed ortho to C3. This works.\n        *   For the alcohol (hydroxyl group) to also be ortho to C3, it must be at C2.\n        *   This means the -OH is at C2.\n        *   The remaining ortho position (C6) must be occupied by the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   The remaining meta position (C5) must be occupied by the -CHO group.\n        *   This gives **Structure II**: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules to Both Possible Structures:** The descriptive text is ambiguous and fits two different molecules. We must name both and then apply a tie-breaking rule. The locants for the substituents in both cases are the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we choose the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's alphabetize the substituent names:\n        *   **C**yano\n        *   **D**imethylamino\n        *   **F**ormyl (the prefix for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n        *   **H**ydroxy\n        *   **M**ethoxy\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**. We should choose the structure where the cyano group has the lower number.\n\n    *   **Naming Structure I (from Case 1):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   The name is: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option D).\n\n    *   **Naming Structure II (from Case 2):**\n        *   The cyano group is at **C3**.\n        *   The name is: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. (This matches option C).\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Name:** According to the IUPAC tie-breaking rule, we must give the lowest locant to the first group in alphabetical order (cyano). Structure II gives the cyano group locant 3, while Structure I gives it locant 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure II and its corresponding name are correct.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned locant number **1**.\n\n**2. Draw the Structure Based on the Positional Information**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the ring starting with C1 = -COOH.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at **C2 and C6** (we don't know which is which yet).\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at **C3 and C5**. This also satisfies the condition that they are meta to each other (C3 and C5 are meta).\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key constraint to finalize the structure.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group, so the -CN must be at **C3 or C5**.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**: Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**: Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4. The -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nIt turns out both possibilities describe valid structures (which are enantiomers of each other). However, they will have the same IUPAC name (without stereochemical descriptors) because the naming rules are unambiguous. Let's pick one of these valid structures to name.\n\nLet's use the structure where: -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2.\nThis means the remaining groups are: -N(CH3)2 at C6 and -CHO at C5.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n*   **C1**: -COOH\n*   **C2**: -OH\n*   **C3**: -CN\n*   **C4**: -OCH3\n*   **C5**: -CHO\n*   **C6**: -N(CH3)2\n\n**3. Number the Ring According to IUPAC Rules**\n\n*   C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering direction that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent that appears first alphabetically is chosen.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker**\n\nThe substituents (other than the parent acid) are:\n*   cyano (-CN)\n*   dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) -> alphabetized under 'd'\n*   formyl (-CHO) -> the name for an aldehyde group as a substituent\n*   hydroxy (-OH)\n*   methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nNow, let's check the locant for the first group in this list (\"cyano\") in both numbering directions:\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering (as drawn above)**: -OH is at C2, **-CN is at C3**.\n*   **Clockwise numbering**: -N(CH3)2 is at C2, -CHO is at C3, -OCH3 is at C4, **-CN is at C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**. The locants are assigned as we determined in Step 2.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\n\n*   **Parent name**: benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents with correct locants**: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n*   **Arrange alphabetically**:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   **Combine**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1.

This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   **Assigning Initial Positions:** Let's place the highest priority group, the carboxylic acid (-COOH), at position C1. This makes the parent molecule a benzoic acid. The other two groups, -CHO and -CN, must be at C3 and C5 to satisfy the *meta-to-each-other* condition.\n*   **Placing Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2)\". The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3)\". The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". The nitrile (-CN) is at C5 (we could have placed it at C3, the result would be the same after renumbering).\n        *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the -OH group must be at **C6**.\n    *   **Finalizing the Structure:** Since the -OH group is at C6, the other group ortho to the carboxylic acid, the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), must be at **C2**.\n\nThe final, unambiguous structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n### 2. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, functional groups are prioritized. The order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic Acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\nWe must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n*   **C1** is fixed at the -COOH group.\n*   We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Path A (Clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering paths result in the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: the substituents are assigned the lowest possible locants based on their alphabetical order.\n*   The substituent names are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   We compare the two paths by looking at the locant assigned to the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Path A (clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 5.\n    *   In Path B (counter-clockwise), \"cyano\" is at position 3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise) is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\nThe correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-dimethylamino**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nTo write the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n\n1.  **C**yano: **3-cyano**\n2.  **D**imethylamino: **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses used for clarity with complex substituents)\n3.  **F**ormyl: **5-formyl**\n4.  **H**ydroxy: **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **M**ethoxy: **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - This uses the incorrect (clockwise) numbering.\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering and lists the substituents non-alphabetically.\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This uses the correct numbering but lists the substituents non-alphabetically (by locant order).\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" prefix)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions C3 and C5. For these three groups to be meta to each other, they must be in a 1,3,5-arrangement.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nSo far, the partial structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key to resolving the arrangement. \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH), and \"nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile (-CN) group:\n        1.  **If -CN is at C3:** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        2.  **If -CN is at C5:** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho, so this works). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\nThe description is slightly ambiguous as it can describe two molecules that are mirror images of each other (enantiomers). However, IUPAC naming rules will lead to a single, unambiguous name. Let's pick one of the valid structures (the first one we found) and apply the naming rules.\n\n**Structure:**\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe principal group (-COOH) is at C1. We need to number the ring (from C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n1.  There are two ways to number the ring: clockwise (C1 -> C2 -> C3...) or counter-clockwise (C1 -> C6 -> C5...).\n2.  In both cases, the set of locants for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This is a tie.\n3.  To break the tie, we give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n4.  Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n5.  The first group alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In our determined structure, the cyano group is at C3. If we numbered the other way, the dimethylamino group would be at C2 and the cyano group would be at C5.\n    *   Comparing the locant for \"cyano\": 3 is lower than 5.\n    *   Therefore, the correct numbering direction is the one that places the cyano group at C3. Our derived structure already uses this correct numbering.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nThe complete name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents are not listed alphabetically)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong numbering)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct: matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (-COOH, -CHO, -CN, -OH). Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents Based on the Description:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and Cyano (-CN):** These are *meta* to the carboxylic acid (C1) and *meta* to each other. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. For them to be meta to each other, one must be at C3 and the other at C5.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3):** *Para* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The para position is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2):** Both are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, one of these groups is at C2 and the other is at C6.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile is the cyano group (-CN). We know it's at C3 or C5.\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. C4 is ortho to both C3 and C5, so this part of the constraint is already satisfied.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN). Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This means the remaining ortho position, **C6**, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group. The formyl group would be at **C5**.\n        *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This means the remaining ortho position, **C2**, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group. The formyl group would be at **C3**.\n\n    Both Case 1 and Case 2 produce valid structures that fit the description. We must now use IUPAC numbering rules to decide which is correct.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\n    *   The C1 position is fixed by the principal functional group (-COOH).\n    *   We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   In both Case 1 and Case 2, the substituents occupy positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The locant set is identical, so we have a tie.\n    *   **Tie-breaking rule:** When the locant set is the same, we assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents and Break the Tie:**\n    *   The substituent prefixes are: `cyano` (-CN), `dimethylamino` (-N(CH3)2), `formyl` (-CHO), `hydroxy` (-OH), and `methoxy` (-OCH3).\n    *   In alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible locant.\n    *   In Case 1, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In Case 2, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use the arrangement from **Case 1**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Name from the Correct Arrangement (Case 1):**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        *   C1: -COOH (benzoic acid)\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   **Assemble the name:** List the substituents with their locants in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n    *   **Final Name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived name `3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\n*   The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n*   Therefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. The parent molecule is named as a benzoic acid.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as carbon #1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents based on Relative Positions**\n\nLet's place the groups on the benzene ring, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **-COOH at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as 'formyl' substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group are at C3 and C5.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\"\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at C2 and C6.\n*   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n\nAt this point, we have the following assignments:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Configuration**\n\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: 'alcohol' refers to the hydroxyl group, and 'nitrile' refers to the cyano group).\n\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   We know the hydroxyl group is at either C2 or C6.\n*   We know the cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case A: Assume the cyano group is at C5.** For the methoxy (C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at C4 and C6. This matches our partial structure, so the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n*   **Case B: Assume the cyano group is at C3.** For the methoxy (C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at C4 and C2. This also matches our partial structure, so the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n\nWe now have two possible structures:\n\n*   **Structure A:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH\n*   **Structure B:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Structure**\n\n*   IUPAC rules state that when there is a choice in numbering, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents listed as prefixes.\n*   The locant set for both structures is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so this rule doesn't resolve the tie.\n*   The tie-breaker rule is to assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Structure A, \"cyano\" is at C5.\n    *   In Structure B, \"cyano\" is at C3.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Structure B is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the positions from the correct structure (Structure B), we assemble the name.\n\n*   **Structure B:**\n    *   C2: hydroxy\n    *   C3: cyano\n    *   C4: methoxy\n    *   C5: formyl\n    *   C6: dimethylamino\n*   List the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   Combine these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6.

It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC rules for nomenclature, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as carbon #1.\n\n**Step 2: Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\nLet's map out the positions of all groups on the benzene ring, starting with C1 for the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** at C1.\n*   **Methoxy group:** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". Para to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   **Carbaldehyde and Cyano groups:** \"all meta to one another\" (referring to -COOH, -CHO, and -CN). Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. Thus, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5 (in some order).\n*   **Hydroxyl and Dimethylamino groups:** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". Ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. Thus, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6 (in some order).\n\nAt this point, the basic structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n*   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at positions C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C5. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This arrangement is consistent with all the given information.\n*   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, they must be at positions C4 and C2. We know methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C3. This means the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This arrangement is also consistent with all the given information.\n\nIt seems there are two possible structures. However, these two structures are actually the same molecule, just viewed from different perspectives (they are mirror images that can be renumbered to be identical). The IUPAC naming rules will resolve this and lead to a single correct name.\n\nLet's analyze the structure derived from Case 2 (it doesn't matter which case we pick, as they represent the same molecule).\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (ortho to -CN at C3)\n*   C3: -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C5: -CHO (the other meta group)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Correct IUPAC Numbering**\nIUPAC rules state that after assigning C1 to the principal functional group, we number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents. In this case, the substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so this rule doesn't help decide the direction of numbering (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).\n\nThe next rule is to assign the lowest numbers based on the alphabetical order of the substituents.\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nWe have two possible numbering schemes for our molecule:\n*   **Numbering A (clockwise):** 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   **Numbering B (counter-clockwise):** 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n\nWe compare these schemes based on the alphabetical list. The first substituent is \"cyano\".\n*   In Numbering A, \"cyano\" gets the locant **3**.\n*   In Numbering B, \"cyano\" gets the locant **5**.\nSince 3 is lower than 5, we **must** use Numbering A.\n\nSo, the correct locants for the substituents are:\n*   Cyano: 3\n*   Dimethylamino: 6\n*   Formyl: 5\n*   Hydroxy: 2\n*   Methoxy: 4\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\nNow, we write the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the functional groups mentioned and determine their priority according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' as a substituent.\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy' as a substituent.\n*   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nThe IUPAC priority order for these groups is:\n1.  **Carboxylic acid**\n2.  Nitrile (Cyano)\n3.  Aldehyde (Formyl)\n4.  Alcohol (Hydroxy)\n5.  Amine (Dimethylamino)\n6.  Ether (Methoxy)\n\nSince the carboxylic acid has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure\n\nNow, we place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description.\n\n1.  **-COOH is at C1.**\n2.  The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** to one another. Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5.\n3.  A **hydroxyl (-OH)** group and a **dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂)** group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6.\n4.  A **methoxy (-OCH₃)** group is **para** to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n\n5.  We use the final piece of information to resolve the ambiguities: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group must be ortho to both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The ortho positions to the methoxy group at C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our earlier finding.\n    *   So, the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test these two possibilities:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3:** Its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works. If -OH is at C2, then -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C6, and -CHO must be at C5.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5:** Its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works. If -OH is at C6, then -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C2, and -CHO must be at C3.\n\nThis gives us two possible structures.\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -CN at C3):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CN at C5):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. The -COOH group is fixed at C1.\n\n*   For **Structure 1**, the locants are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   For **Structure 2**, the locants are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nSince both numbering schemes result in the same set of locants {2,3,4,5,6}, we must apply the next rule: give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is **Cyano**.\n\n*   In **Structure 1**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In **Structure 2**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule.**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we list the substituents alphabetically and attach their corresponding locants.\n\n*   Structure 1 positions:\n    *   C3: Cyano\n    *   C6: Dimethylamino\n    *   C5: Formyl\n    *   C2: Hydroxy\n    *   C4: Methoxy\n\n*   Assembling the name in alphabetical order:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and order)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes)\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct numbering and alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the description to build the chemical structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among all the given functional groups, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Major Groups:**\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are both *meta* to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are also *meta* to one another. If one is at C3 and the other at C5, they are separated by C4, which is a meta relationship. This confirms the 1,3,5-substitution pattern for the -COOH, -CHO, and -CN groups.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The para position is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Crucial Constraint:** The methoxy group (at C4) and the alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (cyano group, -CN).\n        *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position (C3 or C5).\n        *   **Case a:** If the cyano group is at **C3**, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. We already know the methoxy group is at C4. The constraint says the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This leaves **C6** for the dimethylamino group and **C5** for the carbaldehyde group.\n        *   **Case b:** If the cyano group is at **C5**, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. Methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This leaves **C2** for the dimethylamino group and **C3** for the carbaldehyde group.\n\n4.  **Finalizing the Structure:**\n    Let's assemble the structure from Case a:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n    Let's assemble the structure from Case b:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n    If you rotate the structure from Case b in the plane of the ring or flip it over, you will find it is the same molecule as the one from Case a. The IUPAC naming system is designed to give only one unique name for a single molecule, so we can proceed with either representation. We will use the structure derived from Case a.\n\n### Step 2: Apply IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Numbering the Ring:** The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1. We need to number the other carbons (C2 to C6) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   **Clockwise (CW) numbering:** The substituents (-OH, -CN, -OCH3, -CHO, -N(CH3)2) get the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (CCW) numbering:** The substituents (-N(CH3)2, -CHO, -OCH3, -CN, -OH) get the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n2.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** Since both numbering directions give the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the next rule: choose the numbering that gives the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n3.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n4.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"Cyano\".\n    *   In the **CW** numbering, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the **CCW** numbering, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **Clockwise (CW) numbering is correct**.\n\n5.  **Assign Final Locants:** Based on the correct CW numbering, the locants for the substituents are:\n    *   2-Hydroxy\n    *   3-Cyano\n    *   4-Methoxy\n    *   5-Formyl\n    *   6-Dimethylamino\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Final Name\n\nWrite the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number. Then, add the parent name.\n\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: prefixes are not in alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: wrong locants and not alphabetized)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. Among the given functional groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy), the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant (position number) **1**.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituents based on the Description**:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is at position **C1**.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH3)** is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is **C4**. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** groups are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 occupy positions C2 and C6.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN occupy positions C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use Additional Constraints to Determine the Exact Positions**: The problem states that the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the hydroxyl (-OH at C2 or C6) groups are both *ortho* to the cyano group (-CN at C3 or C5).\n    *   **Case 1: Assume the cyano group (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. This would require the methoxy group to be at C4 (which it is) and the hydroxyl group to be at C6. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position)\n        *   C3: -CHO (the remaining meta position)\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n    *   **Case 2: Assume the cyano group (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. This would require the methoxy group to be at C4 (which it is) and the hydroxyl group to be at C2. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   C5: -CHO (the remaining meta position)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position)\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Rules for Numbering**: We have two possible valid arrangements of substituents, both using the locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the set of locants, IUPAC rules state that we should assign the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents**: The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\n6.  **Choose the Correct Numbering**:\n    *   In **Case 1**, the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano\", is at position **5**.\n    *   In **Case 2**, the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano\", is at position **3**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Case 2** is the correct numbering scheme according to IUPAC rules.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final Name**: Using the arrangement from Case 2, we list the substituents alphabetically, preceded by their locants, and finish with the parent name.\n    *   Arrangement: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n    *   Alphabetical listing:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Full Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options**: This constructed name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol > Amine). Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Map the Substituents based on the description:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl):** meta to C1 (i.e., at C3 or C5).\n    *   **Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano):** meta to C1 (i.e., at C3 or C5, the one not taken by -CHO) and also meta to the -CHO group. Placing them at C3 and C5 satisfies the condition that they are meta to each other and to C1.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy):** para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy):** ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino):** ortho to the carboxylic acid. It must occupy the other ortho position (C2 or C6).\n\n3.  **Resolve the Ambiguity using the Final Clue:** The problem states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) is at C2 or C6.\n\n    Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n    *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho to C5). This fits.\n        *   The alcohol (-OH) must be at C6 (the other ortho position to C5). This fits.\n        *   This places the remaining dimethylamino group at C2 and the formyl group at C3.\n        *   Let's check the meta condition: -COOH (1), -CHO (3), -CN (5). They are all meta to each other. This structure is valid.\n        *   **Structure A:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho to C3). This fits.\n        *   The alcohol (-OH) must be at C2 (the other ortho position to C3).

This structure is also valid.\n        *   **Structure C:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure:** We have two possible structures that fit the description, both with substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. According to IUPAC rules, when two different numbering schemes produce the same set of locants, we must use alphabetical order as a tie-breaker. The substituent that comes first alphabetically should be assigned the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   **List substituents alphabetically:**\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n    *   **Compare the two structures:**\n        *   In Structure A, the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **5**.\n        *   In Structure C, the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **3**.\n\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme for **Structure C is the correct one**.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name from Structure C:** Now we write the name for Structure C, listing the substituents in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n\n    *   **Structure C:**\n        *   C1: Benzoic acid\n        *   C2: Hydroxy\n        *   C3: Cyano\n        *   C4: Methoxy\n        *   C5: Formyl\n        *   C6: Dimethylamino\n\n    *   **Assemble the name alphabetically:**\n        *   3-cyano-\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n        *   5-formyl-\n        *   2-hydroxy-\n        *   4-methoxy-\n        *   benzoic acid\n\n    *   **Final Name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:** This name matches option C exactly.\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and non-alphabetical order)\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct structure but non-alphabetical order)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The first step in naming a polysubstituted benzene ring is to identify the principal functional group, which will determine the parent name and the numbering of the ring. The functional groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority order for these groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Hydroxyl > Amino\n\n    Therefore, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Draw and Number the Structure:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description:\n    *   **Position 1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Ortho to -COOH (Positions 2 and 6):** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Para to -COOH (Position 4):** A methoxy (-OCH3) group is para to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Meta to -COOH (Positions 3 and 5):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid.\n\n    Now, let's use the other positional information to place the substituents unambiguously:\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 4 is also *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN). This means the nitrile must be at position 3 or 5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) is also *ortho* to the nitrile (-CN). The alcohol is at position 2 or 6. If the nitrile is at position 3, the alcohol must be at position 2. If the nitrile is at position 5, the alcohol must be at position 6.\n\n    Let's try assigning the nitrile to position 3:\n    *   **Position 1:** -COOH\n    *   **Position 3:** -CN (meta to -COOH, ortho to -OCH3 at 4)\n    *   **Position 4:** -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   The alcohol (-OH) must be ortho to the nitrile, so it is at **Position 2**. This is consistent with it being ortho to the -COOH.\n    *   The remaining ortho position to -COOH is 6. This must be where the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) goes.\n    *   The remaining meta position is 5. This is where the carbaldehyde (-CHO) must go. This is consistent with it being meta to -COOH.\n\n    So, the substitution pattern is:\n    *   1: -COOH\n    *   2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n3.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now we list the substituents (other than the principal group) in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers.\n    *   Cyano (C)\n    *   Dimethylamino (D)\n    *   Formyl (F)\n    *   Hydroxy (H)\n    *   Methoxy (M)\n\n    Let's assemble the name based on this order and their positions:\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n    *   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n    Our constructed name, \"3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid,\" matches option D perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a polysubstituted benzene derivative. The process involves three main steps:\n1.  Deduce the structure of the molecule from the description.\n2.  Determine the correct numbering of the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules.\n3.  Assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 1: Deducing the Structure**\n\n1.  **Parent Compound:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. By convention, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Placing Substituents:**\n    *   We place the -COOH group at C1.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5. They are also meta to each other, which is consistent with being at C3 and C5.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the -COOH group. This places it at C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the -COOH group. This means they occupy positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A final crucial piece of information is given to resolve the ambiguity of the C2/C6 and C3/C5 positions: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   The nitrile (cyano) group must be at a position where C4 is an ortho position. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Therefore, the nitrile group could be at C3 or C5.\n        *   Let's assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3. The positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The description states that the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. Since methoxy is at C4, this means the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2.\n        *   This arrangement places the -OH at C2. Since -OH and -N(CH3)2 are on C2 and C6, the -N(CH3)2 group must be at C6.\n        *   This also means the remaining major substituent, the carbaldehyde (-CHO), is at C5.\n\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all the information:\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   -COOH, -CHO (at C5), -CN (at C3) are all meta to one another. (Correct)\n    *   -OH (at C2) and -N(CH3)2 (at C6) are ortho to -COOH. (Correct)\n    *   -OCH3 (at C4) is para to -COOH. (Correct)\n    *   -OCH3 (at C4) and -OH (at C2) are ortho to -CN (at C3). (Correct)\n\nThe structure is confirmed.\n\n**Step 2: IUPAC Numbering**\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We now need to decide whether to number the ring clockwise or counter-clockwise to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Numbering Scheme 1 (Clockwise, as deduced above):**\n    *   Substituents at: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n*   **Numbering Scheme 2 (Counter-clockwise):**\n    *   This would place -N(CH3)2 at C2, -CHO at C3, -OCH3 at C4, -CN at C5, and -OH at C6.\n    *   The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering schemes produce the exact same set of locants, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering that gives a lower number to the first substituent in alphabetical order is chosen.\n\n**Step 3: Alphabetizing and Assembling the Name**\n\n1.  **List and Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   Cyano (-CN)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   Formyl (-CHO)\n    *   Hydroxy (-OH)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\n2.  **Apply Tie-breaker Rule:** We compare the locants for each substituent in alphabetical order for the two numbering schemes.\n    *   **Cyano:** Scheme 1 gives it **3**. Scheme 2 gives it **5**. Since 3 < 5, Scheme 1 (clockwise numbering) is the correct one.\n\n3.  **Final Locants (from Scheme 1):**\n    *   2-Hydroxy\n    *   3-Cyano\n    *   4-Methoxy\n    *   5-Formyl\n    *   6-Dimethylamino\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name:** Combine the alphabetically-ordered prefixes with their correct locants, followed by the parent name. Parentheses are used for the complex substituent \"dimethylamino\".\n\n    `3-cyano-`\n    `6-(dimethylamino)-`\n    `5-formyl-`\n    `2-hydroxy-`\n    `4-methoxy`\n    `benzoic acid`\n\n    The full name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents based on Relative Positions:**\n    *   **Principal Group:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n    *   **Para Group:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at **C4**.\n    *   **Meta Groups:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1). The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, the formyl and cyano groups are at C3 and C5, in some order.\n    *   **Ortho Groups:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid (C1). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6, in some order.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure:**\n    *   The problem states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Nitrile is the -CN group, alcohol is the -OH group).\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4 and the hydroxyl group is at either C2 or C6. The cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Cyano (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and hydroxyl (-OH) to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This is a valid arrangement.\n        *   **Case 2: Cyano (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and hydroxyl (-OH) to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid arrangement.\n\n4.  **Establish the Two Possible Structures (Numbering Schemes):**\n    *   From the analysis above, we have two potential structures that fit the description. Both have -COOH at C1 and -OCH3 at C4.\n    *   **Structure A (from Case 1):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl) - *since -CN is at C3*\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) - *since -OH is at C2*\n        *   The locant set (positions of substituents) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Structure B (from Case 2):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) - *since -OH is at C6*\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl) - *since -CN is at C5*\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Tie-Breaking Rules:**\n    *   When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set (in this case, both are {2,3,4,5,6}), we must use alphabetical order to break the tie.\n    *   The rule is: Assign the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **Cyano**\n        2.  **Dimethylamino**\n        3.  **Formyl**\n        4.  **Hydroxy**\n        5.  **Methoxy**\n    *   Now, we look at the position of the first substituent in our alphabetical list, \"cyano\".\n        *   In Structure A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n        *   In Structure B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Structure A** is the correct one.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    *   Using the correct structure (Structure A), we list the substituents alphabetically, along with their assigned numbers.\n    *   Parent name: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents (alphabetical):\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combining these gives the full name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrectly ordered)\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name)\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a thinking process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   The functional groups mentioned are carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as carbon #1 (C1).\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on Relative Positions:**\n*   **-COOH:** At C1.\n*   **-OCH₃ (methoxy):** Para to the carboxylic acid. This means it is at C4.\n*   **-CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano):** Both are meta to the carboxylic acid, so they are at C3 and C5. They are also meta to each other, which is consistent with one being at C3 and the other at C5.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl) and -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino):** Both are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at C2 and C6.\n\nAt this point, the basic structure is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Positions:**\n*   The clue is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent with what we already know.\n*   The alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This works, as C6 is one of the available ortho positions to the main -COOH group.\n    *   **Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This also works, as C2 is the other available ortho position to the main -COOH group.\n\nThis gives us two possible complete structures.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Structure:**\n*   The IUPAC rule for numbering a ring when two or more numbering schemes give the same set of locants (here, the substituents are always at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n\n*   Let's analyze our two possible structures again:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** -CN is at C5, -OH is at C6. The remaining ortho position (C2) has -N(CH₃)₂, and the remaining meta position (C3) has -CHO. The \"cyano\" group gets number 5.\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** -CN is at C3, -OH is at C2. The remaining ortho position (C6) has -N(CH₃)₂, and the remaining meta position (C5) has -CHO. The \"cyano\" group gets number 3.\n\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering corresponds to **Structure from Case 2**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name:**\n*   The correct structure has the following substituents and locants:\n    *   C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (**2-hydroxy**)\n    *   C3: -CN (**3-cyano**)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (**4-methoxy**)\n    *   C5: -CHO (**5-formyl**)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (**6-(dimethylamino)** - parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   Now, arrange these substituent names alphabetically and place them before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy-**\n*   Combining them gives: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Match with the Provided Options:**\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct locants and correct alphabetical order)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants based on numbering rules)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect locants and incorrect alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound\n\n*   The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents.\n*   We need to identify the principal functional group to determine the parent name. The priority order for the given functional groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid (-COOH) > Aldehyde (-CHO, carbaldehyde) > Nitrile (-CN, cyano) > Ketone > Alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl) > Amine (-N(CH3)2, dimethylamino) > Ether (-OCH3, methoxy).\n*   The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**.\n*   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given relative positions.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to COOH:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to COOH:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n*   **Remaining positions:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl prefix) and a cyano group (-CN) are on the remaining positions, C3 and C5. The description says they are meta to one another, which is consistent with the C3 and C5 positions.\n*   **Nitrile relationships (key to solving ambiguity):**\n    1.  The methoxy group at C4 is ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent.\n    2.  The alcohol (-OH) is also ortho to the nitrile (-CN). This is the crucial piece of information to fix the positions of the ortho and meta groups.\n        *   **Case 1:** Let's assume the -OH group is at C2. The positions ortho to C2 are C1 and C3. Since C1 has the -COOH group, the -CN group must be at **C3**.\n        *   **Case 2:** Let's assume the -OH group is at C6. The positions ortho to C6 are C1 and C5. So the -CN group must be at **C5**.\n\n    Let's follow Case 1, which places -OH at C2 and -CN at C3.\n    *   If -OH is at C2, then the other ortho group, -N(CH3)2, must be at **C6**.\n    *   If -CN is at C3, then the other meta group, -CHO, must be at **C5**.\n\n    Let's verify this structure:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -OH\n    *   **C3:** -CN\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3\n    *   **C5:** -CHO\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH3)2\n\n    This structure satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. The numbering (1 -> 2 -> 3...) is clockwise.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\n*   The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locant set to the substituents.\n*   Let's check both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering from C1:\n    *   **Clockwise:** Substituents are at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise:** Substituents are also at C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since the locant sets are identical, we use the alphabetical order of the substituent names to break the tie. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that appears first in the alphabet.\n*   The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In the clockwise numbering scheme (derived above), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the counter-clockwise scheme, the -N(CH3)2 group would be at C2, -CHO at C3, -OCH3 at C4, -CN at **C5**, and -OH at C6.\n*   Comparing the locants for \"cyano\": 3 (clockwise) vs. 5 (counter-clockwise). Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering is correct**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow we assemble the full IUPAC name using the correct (clockwise) numbering and alphabetical order of substituents.\n\n1.  **Numbering and Substituents:**\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n2.  **Alphabetize:**\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)  *(Note: The 'di' counts for alphabetization in this case)*\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n3.  **Combine with Parent Name:**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n### 5. Match with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived name with the given options:\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetization.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the question to build the structure of the molecule.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The molecule is a derivative of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. By IUPAC convention, the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the principal functional group (the carboxylic acid) is assigned locant number 1 (C1).\n\n*   **Substituent Placement:**\n    1.  **Carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) are all meta to one another.**\n        *   If -COOH is at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So, the -CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano) groups are at C3 and C5.\n    2.  **Hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino [-N(CH3)2] are ortho to the carboxylic acid.**\n        *   If -COOH is at C1, the ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, the -OH and -N(CH3)2 groups are at C2 and C6.\n    3.  **A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid.**\n        *   If -COOH is at C1, the para position is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at C4.\n    4.  **The methoxy group (-OCH3) and the hydroxyl group (-OH) are both ortho to the cyano group (-CN).**\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This confirms the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   This last piece of information allows us to determine the exact arrangement. Let's consider the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n            *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The hydroxyl group (-OH) must be ortho to it. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at C2.\n            *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The hydroxyl group (-OH) must be ortho to it. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by methoxy, the -OH group must be at C6.\n\n### 2. Construct the Possible Structures\n\nBased on the deductions above, we can draw two possible structures.\n\n*   **Structure A (from Case 1):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (ortho to -CN at C3)\n    *   C3: -CN (meta to -COOH)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   C5: -CHO (meta to -COOH and -CN)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position to -COOH)\n    This corresponds to numbering clockwise from the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Structure B (from Case 2):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C6: -OH (ortho to -CN at C5)\n    *   C5: -CN (meta to -COOH)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (para to -COOH)\n    *   C3: -CHO (meta to -COOH and -CN)\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (the remaining ortho position to -COOH)\n    This corresponds to numbering counter-clockwise from the carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth structures fulfill all the descriptive conditions given in the problem. The correct name depends on IUPAC's rules for numbering the benzene ring.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Lowest Locant Set:** We need to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   For Structure A (clockwise), the locants are {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   For Structure B (counter-clockwise), the locants are also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we have a tie. We must proceed to the next rule.\n\n2.  **Alphabetical Order Tie-Breaker:** When the lowest locant set rule results in a tie, the numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        1.  **c**yano\n        2.  **d**imethylamino\n        3.  **f**ormyl\n        4.  **h**ydroxy\n        5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   Now, we look for the locant of the first group in this list, 'cyano', in our two possible numbering schemes.\n        *   In **Structure A** (clockwise numbering), the cyano group is at position **3**.\n        *   In **Structure B** (counter-clockwise numbering), the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    *   Since 3 is a lower number than 5, the IUPAC rules prefer the numbering scheme of **Structure A**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow we write the final name using the numbering from Structure A and arranging the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents (with correct locants from Structure A):**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n*   **Final Name (alphabetized):**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO, also called formyl), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on the Description**\n\nLet's draw the benzene ring and place the substituents according to the given relative positions.\n\n*   **-COOH is at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern for these three groups. Since -COOH is at C1, the **-CHO (formyl)** and **-CN (cyano)** groups must be at positions **C3 and C5**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the **-OH (hydroxy)** and **-N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)** groups are at positions **C2 and C6**.\n*   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position to C1 is C4. So, the **-OCH3 (methoxy)** group is at position **C4**.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Positions**\n\n*   The final clue is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: alcohol = hydroxyl group, nitrile = cyano group).\n*   We know the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   We know the hydroxyl group (-OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The cyano group (-CN) must be positioned ortho to both the -OCH3 at C4 and the -OH group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the cyano group (-CN):\n\n*   **Case A: Assume -CN is at C3.**\n    *   Is C3 ortho to the methoxy group at C4? Yes.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to -CN at C3, the -OH group must be at C2 or C4.\n    *   Since we know -OH is at C2 or C6, it must be at **C2**.\n    *   This arrangement works. The full structure would be:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n*   **Case B: Assume -CN is at C5.**\n    *   Is C5 ortho to the methoxy group at C4? Yes.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to -CN at C5, the -OH group must be at C4 or C6.\n    *   Since we know -OH is at C2 or C6, it must be at **C6**.\n    *   This arrangement also works. The full structure would be:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Two Possible Structures**\n\nWe have two valid structures (A and B) that fit the description. We must use IUPAC rules to decide which numbering scheme is correct.\n\n*   List the substituents (as prefixes) in alphabetical order:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Both numbering schemes (from Case A and Case B) give the same set of locants for the substituents: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   When two or more numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by assigning the lowest number to the substituent cited first in the alphabetical name.\n\nLet's compare the locants for the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\"):\n*   In Case A, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Case A is the correct one**.\n\n**5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the structure and numbering from Case A:\n*   Substituents with their locants: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n*   Parent name: benzoic acid.\n*   Assemble the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n\nThe correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure and alphabetical order)\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (This is the name for the structure from Case B, which is incorrect by the tie-breaker rule)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino\n\nThe highest priority group is the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure of the Molecule\n\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the positional information provided.\n\n*   **-COOH is at C1.**\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, which is named 'formyl' as a substituent) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this arrangement works.\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl group (-OH) and the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at positions C2 and C6.\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The methoxy group is at C4. The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to it. Positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's combine these facts to resolve the ambiguities (which group is at C3/C5 and which is at C2/C6):\n\n*   We know the cyano group is at either C3 or C5.\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   Since the methoxy group at C4 is ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at either **C3** or **C5**. This is consistent.\n*   Now, consider the hydroxyl group. It must be ortho to the cyano group.\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** The ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the C1-COOH (i.e., at C2 or C6), the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** The ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the C1-COOH (i.e., at C2 or C6), the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**.\n\nThese two cases actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from two different directions. IUPAC numbering rules will determine which is the correct way to number the ring. Let's write down the structure based on Case 1.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl, since CN is at C3)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, since OH is at C2)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions described in the question.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe have established the connections, but we need to confirm the numbering. We must number the ring starting from C1 (-COOH) in the direction that gives the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n\n*   **Numbering clockwise (as built in Case 1):** The substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** This would correspond to Case 2. The substituents would be at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n\nSince the set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is the same for both directions, we must use the next rule: give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically.\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino (Note: \"dimethylamino\" is a single substituent name and is alphabetized under 'd')\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n*   In the clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n*   In the counter-clockwise numbering scheme, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct assignment of locants is:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final Name\n\nNow, we write the full IUPAC name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituent names)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Options\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect, substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct.** This matches our derived name exactly.\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. We must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is assigned position **1**.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Key Groups:** \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   This means these three groups occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other on the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, it is at position 1.\n    *   Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions **3 and 5**.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions **2 and 6**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position **4**.\n\n4.  **Final Structural Clue:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. Since the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5, this condition is always met for the methoxy group.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6. It must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), which is at C3 or C5. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case A: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 2 or 4. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C2**.\n        *   **Case B: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 4 or 6. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C6**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Full Structure:**\n    *   From Case A (nitrile at C3):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl, the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, the other ortho group)\n    *   From Case B (nitrile at C5):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   If you examine these two resulting structures, you will find they are identical. Structure B is just Structure A flipped horizontally. Therefore, the description points to a single, unique molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering:** The numbering starts at C1 (-COOH). We need to decide whether to number clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...) or counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...). The rule is to choose the direction that gives the **lowest possible set of locants** to the substituents.\n    *   In our case, the substituents are at all other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the direction.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n4.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n5.  **Comparing Numbering Directions:**\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...):** This gives the locants {2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   **Clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...):** This gives the locants {6-hydroxy, 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 2-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   Let's check the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**.\n\n6.  **Final Name Construction:** We use the locants from the counter-clockwise numbering and list the substituents in alphabetical order.\n    *   The correct locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The name is constructed as: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetization.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants (results from choosing the wrong numbering direction).\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This lists the substituents by number, not alphabetically, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is based on a benzene ring. To determine the parent name, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. The groups present are:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl)\n    *   Cyano (-CN, prefix: cyano)\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH, prefix: hydroxy)\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix: dimethylamino)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3, prefix: methoxy)\n\n    The priority order is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n    Since the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n    *   **-COOH** is at position **1**.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** are meta to the -COOH. This means they are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3)** is para to the -COOH. This places it at position **4**.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** are ortho to the -COOH. This places them at positions 2 and 6.\n\n    Now we have to figure out the exact arrangement. We use the final piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at position 4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n        *   **Case 1: Cyano at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case 2: Cyano at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\n    The description also states that the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the hydroxyl is at C2. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C6.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the hydroxyl is at C6. This means the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\n    Both cases are possible so far. Let's check the position of the carbaldehyde group. It must be at the remaining meta position (3 or 5).\n    *   In Case 1 (Cyano at C3), the carbaldehyde is at C5.\n    *   In Case 2 (Cyano at C5), the carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\n    This means we have two possible numbering schemes for the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\n    *   **Scheme A (Counter-clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2\n    *   **Scheme B (Clockwise):** 1-COOH, 2-N(CH3)2, 3-CHO, 4-OCH3, 5-CN, 6-OH\n\n3.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Lowest Locant Rule):**\n    We need to choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest set of locants for the substituents. The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both schemes.\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker rule: when two or more numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the direction is chosen that assigns the lowest number to the group cited first as a prefix in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    The prefixes for the substituents are:\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n    Alphabetically, \"cyano\" comes first. Therefore, we must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lowest possible number.\n\n    *   In Scheme A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Scheme A**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Scheme A, we have:\n    *   at C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   at C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   at C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   at C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   at C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   at C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    Now, list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers:\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy-**\n\n    Combine these alphabetically and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\" at the end.\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Molecular Description\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description into a list of substituents and their relative positions on a benzene ring.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main Functional Groups:**\n    1.  Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    2.  Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)\n    3.  Cyano group (-CN)\n    *   These three groups are **meta** to one another (e.g., at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n*   **Other Substituents (relative to the carboxylic acid):**\n    4.  Hydroxyl group (-OH), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    5.  Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂), **ortho** to -COOH.\n    6.  Methoxy group (-OCH₃), **para** to -COOH.\n*   **Additional Positional Constraints:**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is **ortho** to the cyano group (-CN).\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we must identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the relevant groups is:\n\n**Carboxylic acid** > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol (Hydroxyl) > Amine > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. The parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given information.\n\n1.  Place the **-COOH** group at position **C1**.\n2.  Since the methoxy group is **para** to the -COOH, place the **-OCH₃** group at position **C4**.\n3.  The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are **meta** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n4.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the -COOH group. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n\nOur ring currently looks like this:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C2/C6:** One is -OH, the other is -N(CH₃)₂\n*   **C3/C5:** One is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\nNow, we use the final constraints to determine the exact positions:\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4. Its ortho positions are C3 and C5. So the cyano group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the position of -CN:\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for the -OH group.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by -OCH₃, the -OH group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position for the -OH group.\n\nThese two cases (Case A and Case B) actually describe the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective (they are enantiomers, but achiral due to a plane of symmetry if we consider the substituents themselves as points, but they are indeed the same molecule by rotation around the C1-C4 axis). Let's proceed with the structure from Case A, which is sufficient to determine the single correct IUPAC name.\n\nBased on Case A:\n*   If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n    *   The remaining meta position, C5, must be the **-CHO** group.\n    *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must be the **-N(CH₃)₂** group.\n\nThe final, unique structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH\n*   **C3:** -CN\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃\n*   **C5:** -CHO\n*   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂\n\n### 4. Number the Ring and Name the Molecule\n\nThe numbering starts with C1 for the -COOH group. We need to number the rest of the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n*   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince there is a tie, IUPAC rules state that we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent (cyano) gets in each numbering scheme:\n*   With our derived structure (C2=-OH, C3=-CN, etc.), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the positions would be C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH₃, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. In this case, the cyano group would be at C5.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering scheme is the one that assigns C3 to the cyano group. This corresponds to the structure as we derived it.\n\nThe final positions are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\nFinally, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe full, correct IUPAC name is:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThis problem requires a systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core and Substituents:**\n    *   The core is a **benzene ring**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' when it's not the principal group.\n        *   Cyano (-CN), also known as nitrile.\n        *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy'.\n        *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n2.  **Determine the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group:**\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure based on Positional Information:**\n    *   Start by placing the -COOH group at **C1**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group\": The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5. Since all three are meta to each other, this 1,3,5-arrangement is confirmed. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**. We don't yet know which is at which position.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   Case 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2. This is a consistent arrangement.\n        *   Case 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since methoxy is at C4, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C6. This is also a consistent arrangement.\n\n    Let's write out the full structures for both cases:\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH)\n\n4.  **Apply Numbering Rules (Lowest Locants):**\n    *   The numbering must start from C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise. The goal is to give the set of substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   For both structures derived above, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the direction that assigns the lowest number to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize Substituents:**\n    *   **c**yano (-CN)\n    *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    The correct alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n6.  **Apply the Tie-breaker and Finalize the Name:**\n    Let's analyze the numbering for the unique structure we have determined.\n    *   The structure is: C1(-COOH), C4(-OCH₃), C2/C6 (-OH, -NMe₂), C3/C5 (-CN, -CHO), with the specific constraints from step 3.\n    *   Let's consider the structure from Case 1 above: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-clockwise):** The substituents would be at: C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n        *   In Direction 1, 'cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   In Direction 2, 'cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Direction 1**.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Direction 1:\n    *   Parent: benzoic acid\n    *   Substituents with locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combine them alphabetically: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The generated name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: Incorrect numbering (violates the tie-breaker rule).\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid: **Correct.**\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid: Incorrect alphabetical order in the name.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these.\n*   Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **Para (C4) Substituent:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Meta (C3 & C5) Substituents:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) and also meta to each other. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n*   **Ortho (C2 & C6) Substituents:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n\n**3. Use Additional Information to Fix the Structure**\n\nWe have one more piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C5, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C3**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n*   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (which is ortho). This fits.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho, so it must be at **C2**.\n    *   If the hydroxyl is at C2, the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**.\n    *   If the cyano is at C3, the carbaldehyde group must be at **C5**.\n    *   This gives the structure: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n\nNotice that these two cases describe the exact same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring. We have now unambiguously determined the constitution of the molecule. The final step is to apply the correct numbering rule.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\n*   **Rule 1: Lowest Locants.** We start at C1 (-COOH). We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   Clockwise numbering gives the substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering also gives the locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   Since both directions give the same set of locants, we must use a tie-breaker rule.\n*   **Rule 2 (Tie-breaker): Alphabetical Priority.** When the locant set is identical, we give the lowest possible number to the substituent group that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   Cyano\n*   Dimethylamino\n*   Formyl (for the -CHO group)\n*   Hydroxy\n*   Methoxy\n\nIn alphabetical order, they are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must choose the numbering direction that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n\n*   **Numbering Direction 1 (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The cyano group is at **C5**.\n*   **Numbering Direction 2 (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2. The cyano group is at **C3**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the correct numbering is the one from Direction 2.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (C3-cyano), we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants:\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino) - parenthesis is used for complex substituents like dimethylamino.\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\", we get the full IUPAC name:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and identify the substituents and their relationships.**\n    *   **Parent structure:** A benzene ring.\n    *   **Principal functional group:** The question lists several functional groups. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n    *   **Substituents and their positions relative to the -COOH group (C1):**\n        *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the -COOH group. The para position to C1 is C4. So, C4 has an -OCH3 group.\n        *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the -COOH group. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the set of substituents at {C2, C6} is {-OH, -N(CH3)2}.\n        *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the -COOH group. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the set of substituents at {C3, C5} is {-CHO, -CN}.\n    *   **Additional constraints:**\n        *   The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all *meta* to one another. This means they occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other. This is consistent with our assignments above (C1, C3, C5).\n        *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" This is a crucial piece of information to determine the exact arrangement of the substituents. Let's analyze this:\n            *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n            *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n            *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n            *   For three groups (A, B, C) where A and B are ortho to C, they must be arranged such that C is in the middle of A and B on the ring (e.g., A at C2, C at C3, B at C4).\n            *   Let's test the possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n                *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at C2. (Positions C2 and C4 are ortho to C3). This configuration is possible.\n                *   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the methoxy (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at C6. (Positions C4 and C6 are ortho to C5). This configuration is also possible.\n\n2.  **Resolve the ambiguity to identify the single correct structure.**\n    The description allows for two possible constitutional isomers.\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:** If -CN is at C3 and -OH is at C2:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the -CHO group.\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   This structure is: {1:-COOH, 2:-OH, 3:-CN, 4:-OCH3, 5:-CHO, 6:-N(CH3)2}.\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:** If -CN is at C5 and -OH is at C6:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C3, must have the -CHO group.\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the -N(CH3)2 group.\n        *   This structure is: {1:-COOH, 2:-N(CH3)2, 3:-CHO, 4:-OCH3, 5:-CN, 6:-OH}.\n\n    Since the question asks for *the* correct IUPAC name, there should be a single answer. The description is ambiguous. However, in such cases, we can apply the IUPAC tie-breaking rule for numbering (P-14.4) to choose between the two resulting structures.

According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority among the given functional groups (-COOH, -CHO, -CN). Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Translate the Positional Information into a Structure:**\n    *   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at **C4**.\n    *   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as 'formyl' as a substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are at the meta positions, which are C3 and C5. The phrase \"all meta to one another\" is geometrically impossible but is best interpreted as these three groups occupying the 1, 3, and 5 positions.\n    *   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at the ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Clue to Resolve Ambiguities:** The crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. For the clue to be true, the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group must be at C2 and C4. We know methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This is a valid position for it. This implies the dimethylamino group is at C6, and the formyl group is at C5.\n    *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. For the clue to be true, the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group must be at C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This is also a valid position. This implies the dimethylamino group is at C2, and the formyl group is at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure:**\n    We have two potential structures, which correspond to the two ways of numbering the ring from C1 (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    Since both numbering directions yield the same lowest locant set ({2,3,4,5,6}), we must use the next rule: assign the lowest possible numbers to the substituents in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino (alphabetized under 'd')\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n6.  **Compare the Locants based on Alphabetical Order:**\n    We compare the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\") for each structure.\n    *   In Structure 1, cyano is at C3.\n    *   In Structure 2, cyano is at C5.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Structure 1 is correct**.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using the substituent names and their locants from the correct structure (Structure 1), we arrange them in alphabetical order.\n    *   Substituents: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n    *   Alphabetical Order: Cyano, Dimethylamino, Formyl, Hydroxy, Methoxy\n    *   Full Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n8.  **Match with the Options:**\n    This name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure and alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect structure based on numbering rules)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Molecule and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano group (-CN), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy group (-OCH3).\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these functional groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amine > Ether.\n    The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, so the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents Based on a Fixed Point:**\n    *   The problem states that a **methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid**. Since the -COOH group is at C1, the methoxy group (-OCH3) must be at **C4**.\n\n3.  **Place the Remaining Substituents Using the Given Relationships:**\n    *   A **hydroxyl group (-OH)** and a **dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2)** are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   A **carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a 'formyl' substituent)** and a **cyano group (-CN)** are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n    *   A key constraint is that the **methoxy group (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (-CN)**.\n        *   Let's test where the nitrile (-CN) group can be. It must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   If the nitrile is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is indeed at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n        *   If the nitrile is at C3, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is indeed at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n    *   This gives us two possible arrangements. We need to use the IUPAC numbering rules to decide between them.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Break the Tie:**\n    The rule for numbering a substituted benzene ring (after assigning C1 to the principal functional group) is to number the ring to give the substituents the **lowest possible set of locants**. If a choice still remains, we give the lowest number to the substituent that comes **first alphabetically**.\n\n    Let's analyze the two possible structures:\n\n    *   **Structure 1:** Let's place the hydroxyl group at **C2** and the nitrile at **C3**.\n        *   C1: -COOH (Principal)\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the formyl group: **C5: -CHO** (formyl).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the dimethylamino group: **C6: -N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino).\n        *   The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    *   **Structure 2:** Let's place the hydroxyl group at **C6** and the nitrile at **C5**.\n        *   C1: -COOH (Principal)\n        *   C2: The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the dimethylamino group: **C2: -N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino).\n        *   C3: The remaining meta position, C3, must have the formyl group: **C3: -CHO** (formyl).\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n    Both structures give the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Now we must use the alphabetical order tie-breaker.\n\n5.  **Apply the Alphabetical Tie-Breaker Rule:**\n    *   First, list the substituent names in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **cyano**\n        2.  **dimethylamino** (the 'd' in dimethyl counts for alphabetization)\n        3.  **formyl**\n        4.  **hydroxy**\n        5.  **methoxy**\n    *   Now, compare the two structures based on the locant of the first substituent in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\").\n        *   In **Structure 1**, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n        *   In **Structure 2**, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n    *   The rule is to choose the numbering that gives the lower locant to the first point of difference. Since 3 < 5, **Structure 1 is the correctly numbered molecule**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using Structure 1, we assemble the name by listing the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   Structure 1 positions: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   Alphabetical order: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n    *   Final Name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived name perfectly matches option C.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering based on the alphabetical tie-breaker.\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order of substituents.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct**.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order of substituents.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the textual description into a chemical structure. Let's place the groups on a benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Identify the main groups:** We have a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) that are all *meta* to one another. The most logical way to arrange this is to place them at positions 1, 3, and 5 on the ring. Let's arbitrarily assign the carboxylic acid to position 1 for now, as it will likely be the principal functional group.\n    *   Position 1: -COOH\n    *   Position 3: -CHO (carbaldehyde)\n    *   Position 5: -CN (cyano)\n\n2.  **Add the remaining substituents relative to the carboxylic acid (-COOH):**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)₂). The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)₂} are at {C2, C6}.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH₃). The para position is C4. So, -OCH₃ is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the final piece of information to resolve ambiguities:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy group (-OCH₃) at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This is consistent.\n    *   This means the alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must be in the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   If the -OH group is at C6, then the dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] must be at the remaining ortho position relative to the carboxylic acid, which is C2.\n\n4.  **Finalized Structure:** Based on this deductive process, we have the following arrangement of substituents (this is just one possible numbering for drawing, not the final IUPAC numbering):\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   **C3:** -CHO\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃\n    *   **C5:** -CN\n    *   **C6:** -OH\n\n### 2. Determine the IUPAC Name\n\nNow, we apply the IUPAC rules of nomenclature to this specific structure.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** We compare the priority of the functional groups present: Carboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Number the Ring:**\n    *   The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **C1**.\n    *   We must then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible set of locants. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   Let's check the locant sets for both directions, based on our derived structure:\n        *   **Numbering Clockwise:** Substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Set: {2,3,4,5,6}\n        *   **Numbering Counter-Clockwise:** The substituents would be -OH at C2, -CN at C3, -CHO at C4, -N(CH3)2 at C5, and -OCH3 at C6. But this does not match our structure. We must stick to the structure we derived. Let's re-state the substituents based on their actual positions on the ring relative to C1: C2 has -N(CH3)2, C3 has -CHO, C4 has -OCH3, C5 has -CN, and C6 has -OH.\n        *   **Numbering Counter-clockwise from C1:** C2 would have -OH, C3 would have -CN, C4 would have -OCH3, C5 would have -CHO, and C6 would have -N(CH3)2.\n    *   The locant set is **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}** in both directions.\n\n3.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **c**yano (-CN)\n        *   **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n        *   **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n        *   **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n        *   **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n    *   The first substituent in the alphabetical list is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering direction that gives 'cyano' the lower number.\n        *   In the **clockwise** direction (C2=-N(CH₃)₂, C3=-CHO,...), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n        *   In the **counter-clockwise** direction (C2=-OH, C3=-CN,...), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the correct IUPAC numbering is **counter-clockwise**.\n\n4.  **Assign Final Locants and Assemble the Name:**\n    Using the correct counter-clockwise numbering, we get:\n    *   C1: -COOH (the parent acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (**2-hydroxy**)\n    *   C3: -CN (**3-cyano**)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (**4-methoxy**)\n    *   C5: -CHO (**5-formyl**)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (**6-(dimethylamino)**)\n\n    Now, assemble the full name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    This name perfectly matches option D.\n\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order)\n    *   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), and methoxy (-OCH₃). According to IUPAC rules for nomenclature priority, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituent Positions:**\n    Let's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the location of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is at C1.**\n    *   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"** The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be meta to each other as well. This implies a 1,3,5 substitution pattern for these three groups. So, if -COOH is at C1, then -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5 (in some order).\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"** The position para to C1 is C4. So, a methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at **C4**.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\"** The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) are at C2 and C6 (in some order).\n    *   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"** We know the methoxy group is at C4 and the nitrile (-CN) group is at C3 or C5. For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile must be at **C3** (or C5). The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to this nitrile. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by methoxy, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n\n3.  **Finalize the Structure and Numbering:**\n    Based on the deductions above, we can finalize the positions:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   **C2:** -OH (Hydroxyl), confirmed from the last clue.\n    *   **C3:** -CN (Cyano), confirmed from the last clue.\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃ (Methoxy), para to COOH.\n    *   **C5:** -CHO (Formyl/Carbaldehyde), meta to COOH and CN.\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino), filling the last ortho position to COOH.\n\n    This arrangement satisfies all conditions given in the description. This numbering direction (counter-clockwise) must be chosen over the clockwise direction. According to IUPAC rules, if the locant sets are identical (both are 2,3,4,5,6), we give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically. The alphabetically first substituent is \"cyano\". In our chosen scheme, cyano is at C3. In the alternative (clockwise) scheme, it would be at C5. Since 3 < 5, our counter-clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n4.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   The substituents are: **c**yano (C3), **d**imethylamino (C6), **f**ormyl (C5), **h**ydroxy (C2), **m**ethoxy (C4).\n    *   The prefixes are alphabetized as: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n    *   We add the corresponding position numbers (locants) before each prefix.\n    *   The complete name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

Let's break down the structure of the molecule step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of the Main Substituents:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** (1,3-relationship) to one another.\n    *   If -COOH is at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5.\n    *   Since the -CHO and -CN groups are also meta to each other, this arrangement (C1, C3, C5) is consistent. For now, let's tentatively place -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Remaining Substituents:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are **ortho** (1,2-relationship) to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is **para** (1,4-relationship) to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This places it at C4.\n    *   We are given a final piece of information to resolve the ambiguity: the methoxy group (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are both **ortho** to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   We tentatively placed the -CN group at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This fits perfectly.\n        *   Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n        *   Since the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6, and we've now placed the hydroxyl group at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n        *   This also confirms that our initial placement of -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5 was correct.\n\n4.  **Summarize the Structure:**\n    *   C1: -COOH (part of the parent name, benzoic acid)\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules:**\n    *   **Numbering:** We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (positions) to the substituents. Starting from C1 (-COOH), we can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n        *   Clockwise: C2-dimethylamino, C3-formyl, C4-methoxy, C5-cyano, C6-hydroxy. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n        *   Counter-clockwise: C2-hydroxy, C3-cyano, C4-methoxy, C5-formyl, C6-dimethylamino. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n        *   When the locant sets are identical, we use alphabetical order of the substituents to decide the numbering. We assign the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically at the first point of difference.\n        *   The first point of difference is C2 vs. C6. We have \"dimethylamino\" vs. \"hydroxy\".\n        *   \"**D**imethylamino\" comes before \"**h**ydroxy\" in the alphabet.\n        *   Therefore, the dimethylamino group gets the lower number (C2), and the numbering proceeds clockwise. Our assignments in step 4 are correct.\n\n    *   **Alphabetize the Prefixes:** The substituent groups must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name. The prefixes are:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   **Assemble the Final Name:** Combine the prefixes in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, and add the parent name at the end.\n        *   5-cyano-\n        *   2-(dimethylamino)-\n        *   3-formyl-\n        *   6-hydroxy-\n        *   4-methoxy\n        *   benzoic acid\n\n    *   The complete name is: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name.**\n    *   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThis question asks for the correct IUPAC name of a substituted benzene derivative. To determine this, we must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure**: The molecule is based on a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom bearing the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Substituent Positions based on C1**:\n    *   **Para (C4)**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at **C4**.\n    *   **Ortho (C2, C6)**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethyl amino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. So, these two groups are at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   **Meta (C3, C5)**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. So, these two groups are at positions **C3** and **C5**. The problem also states these three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to one another, which is consistent with them being at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n3.  **Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Isomer**: The description provides a key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities at positions (C2/C6) and (C3/C5): \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) can be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) can be at C2 or C6.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n        *   **Case i: If -CN is at C3**, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For both the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This fixes the arrangement:\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n            *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n            *   This leaves C5 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C6 for the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2). This defines a specific constitutional isomer (let's call it Isomer 1).\n        *   **Case ii: If -CN is at C5**, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For both the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl groups to be ortho, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This also fixes the arrangement:\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n            *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n            *   This leaves C3 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C2 for the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2). This defines a second constitutional isomer (Isomer 2).\n\nSince the problem asks for a single correct IUPAC name, the nomenclature rules must distinguish between these two isomers and select one as having the correct name provided in the options.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Principal Functional Group**: Carboxylic acid is the highest priority group, so it determines the parent name (benzoic acid) and C1 position.\n\n2.  **Numbering the Ring**: We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   In both Isomer 1 and Isomer 2, the substituents are at all available positions: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from C1 gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from C1 also gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule**: When the locant sets are identical, we assign the lowest numbers based on the alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes. The substituent cited first alphabetically gets the lowest possible locant.\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n    *   The substituent that comes first is **cyano**. Its possible locations in the ring are C3 or C5. According to the tie-breaking rule, it should be assigned the lower number, which is **3**.\n    *   This rule selects **Isomer 1** as the correct structure, where the cyano group is at C3. It also dictates that the numbering must proceed in the direction that assigns '3' to the cyano group (i.e., clockwise).\n\n4.  **Final Naming**: Based on this logic, the correct structure is Isomer 1, and the numbering is clockwise.\n    *   C1: -COOH (parent name: benzoic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    Now, we write the full name by arranging the prefixes alphabetically:\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\n    Combining these gives the name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing with Options\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nB) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nC) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\nD) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name matches option A exactly. Options C and D are incorrect because the substituents are not listed alphabetically. Option B corresponds to a different numbering of Isomer 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\n\n*   The molecule is based on a **benzene ring**.\n*   The highest priority functional group mentioned is the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n*   Therefore, the parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents based on their Positions**\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring relative to C1.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) is at one of these positions, and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is at the other.\n*   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**:\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   The condition that the carbaldehyde and cyano group are also meta to each other is satisfied if one is at C3 and the other at C5.\n\nAt this point, our ring looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH or -N(CH3)2\n*   C3: -CHO or -CN\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C5: -CN or -CHO (the opposite of C3)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 or -OH (the opposite of C2)\n\n**3. Use the Final Clue to Determine the Exact Structure**\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous finding.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to C5, it must be at C4 or C6. C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group. Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C6**. This means the dimethylamino group must be at **C2**, and the formyl group must be at **C3**.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to C3, it must be at C2 or C4. C4 is occupied by the methoxy group. Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at **C2**. This means the dimethylamino group must be at **C6**, and the formyl group must be at **C5**.\n\nBoth cases lead to a fully defined structure. Let's see if they are the same molecule, just numbered differently.\n*   **Structure from Case 1:** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n*   **Structure from Case 2:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\nIf you rotate Structure 1 in the plane or flip it, you cannot turn it into Structure 2. However, the IUPAC naming rules will select only one of these as the correctly numbered version of a single molecule. Let's realize that Structure 1 is just Structure 2 numbered in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise vs. clockwise). The molecule itself is unique.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nThe goal is to number the ring (starting with C1 for the -COOH group) to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. In this case, substituents are at C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6, so the locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of which direction we number (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n\nWhen the locant sets are identical, we break the tie by giving the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    1.  **C**yano (-CN)\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    3.  **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n    5.  **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\n*   Now let's check our two numbering directions for the unique molecule:\n    *   **Numbering Path A (corresponding to Case 2):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2.\n    *   **Numbering Path B (corresponding to Case 1):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH.\n\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.\n    *   In Path A, cyano is at **C3**.\n    *   In Path B, cyano is at **C5**.\n\n*   Since 3 < 5, **Path A is the correct IUPAC numbering**.\n\n**5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nUsing the correct numbering (Path A), the positions are:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\nNow, we list these substituents alphabetically, prefixed with their locants, before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  3-cyano\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)\n3.  5-formyl\n4.  2-hydroxy\n5.  4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: substituents not listed alphabetically)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: based on the wrong numbering direction)\n\nThe name we derived matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Description and Identify Substituents\nFirst, let's break down the textual description of the molecule into its components and their relative positions.\n*   **Parent Ring:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethyl amino (-N(CH₃)₂), named as 'dimethylamino' prefix.\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃), named as 'methoxy' prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Principal Functional Group and Parent Name\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position 1 (C1).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure Based on Positional Constraints\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the given relative positions.\n\n1.  **-COOH is at C1.**\n2.  **`para` to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.** The `para` position to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4.**\n3.  **`A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.`** Since -COOH is at C1, the other two groups (-CHO and -CN) must be at C3 and C5. This creates two possibilities for the arrangement.\n4.  **`Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.`** The `ortho` positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH and -N(CH₃)₂} are located at {C2 and C6}.\n5.  **`The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.`** This is the key constraint to resolve the ambiguities. The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For a group to be `ortho` to methoxy, it must be at C3 or C5. So, the nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent with point 3.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n\n*   **Case A: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   For the alcohol (-OH) to be `ortho` to the nitrile at C5, it must be at C4 or C6.\n    *   We know -OCH₃ is at C4, so the **-OH group must be at C6.**\n    *   Since {-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at {C2, C6}, the **-N(CH₃)₂ group must be at C2.**\n    *   This leaves C3 for the **-CHO group.**\n    *   This gives us **Isomer 1**:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   C3: -CHO\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n\n*   **Case B: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   For the alcohol (-OH) to be `ortho` to the nitrile at C3, it must be at C2 or C4.\n    *   We know -OCH₃ is at C4, so the **-OH group must be at C2.**\n    *   Since {-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at {C2, C6}, the **-N(CH₃)₂ group must be at C6.**\n    *   This leaves C5 for the **-CHO group.**\n    *   This gives us **Isomer 2**:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CHO\n        *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\nBoth isomers (1 and 2) are consistent with the textual description.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the IUPAC \"Lowest Locants\" Rule to Choose the Correct Isomer\nWhen a description can lead to more than one constitutional isomer, IUPAC nomenclature prefers the isomer that results in the lowest possible locant set when the substituents are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nFirst, let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nNow, let's find the locant set for each isomer based on this alphabetical list. (Note: The methoxy group is at C4 in both isomers).\n\n*   **Locant Set for Isomer 1:**\n    *   Cyano is at **5**.\n    *   Dimethylamino is at **2**.\n    *   Formyl is at **3**.\n    *   Hydroxy is at **6**.\n    *   Methoxy is at **4**.\n    *   The set is **{5, 2, 3, 6, 4}**.\n\n*   **Locant Set for Isomer 2:**\n    *   Cyano is at **3**.\n    *   Dimethylamino is at **6**.\n    *   Formyl is at **5**.\n    *   Hydroxy is at **2**.\n    *   Methoxy is at **4**.\n    *   The set is **{3, 6, 5, 2, 4}**.\n\nNow, compare the two sets term by term:\n*   Set 1: (5, 2, 3, 6, 4)\n*   Set 2: (3, 6, 5, 2, 4)\n\nAt the first point of difference, the number in Set 2 (**3**) is lower than the number in Set 1 (**5**). Therefore, the IUPAC rules prefer **Isomer 2**.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Correct Name for the Preferred Isomer\nWe have established that the correct structure is Isomer 2:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH\n*   C3: -CN\n*   C4: -OCH₃\n*   C5: -CHO\n*   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n\nNow, we name this specific molecule. The parent name is **benzoic acid**. We list the substituents with their locants and arrange them alphabetically:\n*   3-**c**yano\n*   6-(**d**imethylamino)\n*   5-**f**ormyl\n*   2-**h**ydroxy\n*   4-**m**ethoxy\n\nCombining these in order gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules for nomenclature of organic compounds, the priority of these functional groups is as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\nTherefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\n\nWe will build the structure step-by-step based on the relative positions given.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzoic acid. We place the -COOH group at the C1 position.\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   This means these three groups are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n    *   With -COOH at C1, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named \"formyl\" as a substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para (opposite) to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho (adjacent) to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at C2 and C6. We still need to determine which is where.\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's assume the -CN group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The description states the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) are at these positions.\n    *   We already placed the -OCH3 group at C4. This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to the acid, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n    *   And the carbaldehyde (-CHO) group must be at C3.\n\nThis gives us a single, unambiguous structure:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n\nThere are two possible directions to number the ring from C1:\n\n*   **Path A (Clockwise):** C1 -> C2(-NMe2) -> C3(-CHO) -> C4(-OCH3) -> C5(-CN) -> C6(-OH).\n    *   The locants are: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n\n*   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** Let's re-label our determined structure for counter-clockwise numbering starting from C1.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   The locants are: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the identical set of locants (2,3,4,5,6), we must use the tie-breaker rule: we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize Substituents and Apply Tie-Breaker\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare the locants for each substituent in our two paths. We look for the first point of difference.\n\n| Substituent (Alphabetical) | Path A Locant (Clockwise) | Path B Locant (Counter-clockwise) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Cyano** | 5 | **3** |\n| Dimethylamino | 2 | 6 |\n| Formyl | 3 | 5 |\n| Hydroxy | 6 | 2 |\n| Methoxy | 4 | 4 |\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\". Path A gives it locant 5, while Path B gives it locant 3. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise numbering) is the correct IUPAC numbering scheme.**\n\n### 5. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct numbering from Path B:\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order followed by the parent name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule\n\nThe problem describes a benzene ring with several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the number **C1**.\n\n### 2. Draw the Molecular Structure from the Description\n\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the provided relative positions.\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to -COOH:** A methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, **C4 is -OCH3**.\n*   **Ortho to -COOH:** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n*   **Meta to one another:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all meta to one another.\n    *   The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   The relationship between C3 and C5 is also meta, which satisfies the condition. So, {-CHO, -CN} are at {C3, C5}.\n\nNow we have two sets of ambiguities to resolve:\n1.  Is -OH at C2 and -N(CH3)2 at C6, or vice-versa?\n2.  Is -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5, or vice-versa?\n\nWe can use the final piece of information to resolve this:\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. The nitrile group (-CN) must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n    *   The alcohol group (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   **Scenario A:** If -CN is at **C3**, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the -OH group to be ortho to it, it must be at C2 (since C4 is already occupied by -OCH3).\n        *   **Scenario B:** If -CN is at **C5**, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For the -OH group to be ortho to it, it must be at C6 (since C4 is occupied).\n\nThis gives us two possible structures:\n\n*   **Structure from Scenario A:**\n    *   -CN is at C3. This means -CHO is at C5.\n    *   -OH is at C2. This means -N(CH3)2 is at C6.\n    *   **Final Structure 1:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n*   **Structure from Scenario B:**\n    *   -CN is at C5. This means -CHO is at C3.\n    *   -OH is at C6. This means -N(CH3)2 is at C2.\n    *   **Final Structure 2:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nBoth structures have substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` in both cases. When the locant sets are identical, we must use a tie-breaker rule: **the numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent cited first in the name (i.e., first in alphabetical order).**\n\nFirst, let's list the substituents alphabetically. (Note: \"dimethylamino\" is alphabetized under 'd').\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nNow, let's check the locant of the first alphabetical substituent ('cyano') in our two possible structures:\n*   In **Structure 1**, the 'cyano' group is at position **3**.\n*   In **Structure 2**, the 'cyano' group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 < 5, IUPAC rules dictate that we must choose the numbering scheme that results in **Structure 1**.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants.\n*   Parent: **benzoic acid**\n*   Substituents (alphabetized):\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these parts gives the full IUPAC name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\nLet's compare our derived name with the given options:\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the description into a chemical structure.\n\n*   **Parent structure**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Principal group**: The problem mentions a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n*   **Main group positions**: The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all *meta* to one another. Starting with -COOH at C1, the *meta* positions are C3 and C5. So, the -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5.\n*   **Other substituent positions (relative to -COOH at C1)**:\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group is *ortho* (C2 or C6).\n    *   A dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group is *ortho* (C2 or C6). So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 occupy the C2 and C6 positions.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (C4).\n\nThis gives us a basic framework:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (one on each)\n*   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN (one on each)\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **Final constraint to determine the exact structure**: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) must be *ortho* to both -OCH3 (at C4) and -OH.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group:\n        1.  **If -CN is at C3**: To be *ortho* to -OCH3 at C4 is correct. To be *ortho* to -OH, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n        2.  **If -CN is at C5**: To be *ortho* to -OCH3 at C4 is correct. To be *ortho* to -OH, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nThis means the description is ambiguous and describes two different constitutional isomers. Let's draw both possibilities and see how the IUPAC naming rules apply.\n\n*   **Molecule A (from possibility 1)**:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n*   **Molecule B (from possibility 2)**:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe primary rule is to give the principal functional group (-COOH) the locant C1. Then, we number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the other substituents. In both molecules A and B, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so the locant set is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nWhen the locant set is the same, we use a tie-breaker: number the ring to give the lowest locant to the substituent that appears first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**:\n    *   **C**yano (-CN)\n    *   **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n    *   **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n    *   **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**.\n\n*   **Naming Molecule A**:\n    *   Numbering clockwise: The cyano group is at C3.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise: The cyano group is at C5.\n    *   Since 3 < 5, we must use the **clockwise** numbering for Molecule A.\n    *   The locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\n*   **Naming Molecule B**:\n    *   Numbering clockwise: The cyano group is at C5.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise: The cyano group is at C3.\n    *   Since 3 < 5, we must use the **counter-clockwise** numbering for Molecule B.\n    *   The locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\nSurprisingly, applying the strict IUPAC numbering rules results in the exact same set of locants for both distinct molecules.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Full IUPAC Name\n\nWe assemble the name by listing the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its determined locant, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\nUsing the locants derived above for both molecules:\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n*   Parent: benzoic acid\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: not alphabetical)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Matches our derived name**)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect: not alphabetical)\n*   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect: this uses a non-preferred numbering scheme)\n\nAlthough the initial description was ambiguous, applying the IUPAC rules systematically leads to a single correct name, which is option B. Both possible interpretations of the structure yield the same IUPAC name.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description\n\n*   **C1**: -COOH (by definition)\n*   **Para to carboxylic acid (C1) is a methoxy group**: The para position is C4. So, **C4** has a **-OCH3** (methoxy) group.\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid (C1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **C2** and **C6** have **-OH** (hydroxyl) and **-N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino) groups, one at each position.\n*   **Meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) are a carbaldehyde and a cyano group**: The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **C3** and **C5** have **-CHO** (formyl) and **-CN** (cyano) groups, one at each position.\n\nAt this point, the ring looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n### 3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Positions\n\n*   The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at **C4**.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must be at C2 or C6.\n\n*   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This configuration works.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This configuration also works.\n\n*   This gives us two possible structures, which are mirror images of each other depending on the numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1 (Clockwise numbering):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2 (Counter-clockwise numbering):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure/Numbering\n\n*   IUPAC rules state that we must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). In this case, both numbering directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise) result in the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Tie-breaker rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we assign the lowest numbers to the substituents that appear first alphabetically.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically (prefixes like 'di-' are ignored for alphabetization):\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Now, compare the locants for the first substituent in the alphabetical list ('cyano') in both structures:\n    *   In the first structure (clockwise numbering), **cyano** is at position **3**.\n    *   In the second structure (counter-clockwise numbering), **cyano** is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the first structure (clockwise numbering) is the correct one according to IUPAC rules.\n\n### 5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name\n\n*   Using the correct structure (Case 1), we list the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl**\n    *   **2-hydroxy**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n*   Combining these gives the full name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetization.\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name exactly.**\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This is the name for the incorrectly numbered structure.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Describes the incorrect structure and is not alphabetized.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule:**\n    The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano (-CN), a hydroxyl (-OH), a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy (-OCH3) group attached to a benzene ring.\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom on the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents based on the Description:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** at C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl as a prefix)** and **cyano (-CN)** are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are also *meta* to each other. If one is at C3 and the other is at C5, they are indeed meta to one another (separated by C4).\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH, or hydroxy)** and **dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)** are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Methoxy (-OCH3)** is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   So far, we know: C1 is -COOH, C4 is -OCH3. The pairs {-CHO, -CN} are at {C3, C5} and {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure:**\n    The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.**\n        *   Is the methoxy group at C4 ortho to C3? Yes.\n        *   Is the hydroxyl group ortho to C3? The hydroxyl must be at C2 or C6. C2 is ortho to C3, while C6 is para to C3. For the condition to be met, the hydroxyl group **must be at C2**.\n        *   This arrangement satisfies all conditions. It implies the dimethylamino is at C6 and the carbaldehyde is at C5.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.**\n        *   Is the methoxy group at C4 ortho to C5? Yes.\n        *   Is the hydroxyl group ortho to C5? The hydroxyl must be at C2 or C6. C6 is ortho to C5, while C2 is para to C5. For the condition to be met, the hydroxyl group **must be at C6**.\n        *   This arrangement also satisfies all conditions. It implies the dimethylamino is at C2 and the carbaldehyde is at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Two Possible Structures:**\n    We have two potential structures that fit the description:\n    *   **Structure I (from Case 1):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2\n    *   **Structure II (from Case 2):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n    The first IUPAC rule is to number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   Locant set for Structure I: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n    *   Locant set for Structure II: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n    Since the locant sets are identical, we must use the tie-breaker rule.\n\n    **Tie-breaker rule:** When numbering choices remain, assign the lowest numbers to the substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n    First, list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n    1.  Cyano\n    2.  Dimethylamino\n    3.  Formyl\n    4.  Hydroxy\n    5.  Methoxy\n\n    Now, compare the locant for the first group in the alphabetical list (\"cyano\") in both structures:\n    *   In Structure I, \"cyano\" is at position **3**.\n    *   In Structure II, \"cyano\" is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure I is the correct one according to IUPAC rules.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using Structure I, we list the substituents with their locants in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   **C**yano: 3-cyano\n    *   **D**imethylamino: 6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   **F**ormyl: 5-formyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy: 2-hydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy: 4-methoxy\n\n    Combining them alphabetically gives:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n6.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    The derived name matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Parent Structure\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**. By IUPAC convention, the carbon atom to which the carboxylic acid group is attached is designated as carbon number 1 (C1).\n\n### Step 2: Place the Substituents based on Given Positions\nLet's build the structure around the C1-COOH group.\n*   **Para (C4) substituent:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it must be at position C4.\n*   **Ortho (C2/C6) substituents:** A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions C2 and C6.\n*   **Meta (C3/C5) substituents:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as the \"formyl\" prefix) and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions C3 and C5.\n\nSo far, the basic layout is:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C4: -OCH3\n*   C2 & C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2 (in some order)\n*   C3 & C5: -CHO and -CN (in some order)\n\n### Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure\nThe final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is fixed at C4.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n\n*   **Case 1: The cyano group is at C3.**\n    *   For the methoxy group (at C4) to be ortho to it, this condition is met (C3 and C4 are adjacent).\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to it, the -OH must be at C2 (since C4 is taken by methoxy).\n    *   This defines the structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C5, must have the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C6, must have the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n*   **Case 2: The cyano group is at C5.**\n    *   For the methoxy group (at C4) to be ortho to it, this condition is met (C4 and C5 are adjacent).\n    *   For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to it, the -OH must be at C6 (since C4 is taken by methoxy).\n    *   This defines the structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH3\n        *   The remaining meta position, C3, must have the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   The remaining ortho position, C2, must have the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\nYou'll notice that the structures from Case 1 and Case 2 are the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). The task now is to determine the correct IUPAC numbering.\n\n### Step 4: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\nThe main functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We number the ring to give the lowest possible set of numbers (locants) to the substituents.\n\n*   **Numbering A (from Case 1):** Substituents are at 2(-OH), 3(-CN), 4(-OCH3), 5(-CHO), 6(-N(CH3)2). The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Numbering B (from Case 2):** Substituents are at 2(-N(CH3)2), 3(-CHO), 4(-OCH3), 5(-CN), 6(-OH). The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nSince both numbering schemes produce the exact same locant set, we must use a tie-breaking rule. The rule states: **If a choice remains, assign the lowest number to the substituent group that is cited first in the name (i.e., the one that comes first alphabetically).**\n\n### Step 5: Alphabetize the Substituents\nLet's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order. Note that prefixes like \"di-\", \"tri-\", etc., are ignored for simple substituents.\n1.  **C**yano (-CN)\n2.  **D**imethylamino (-N(CH3)2) --- 'd' is used for alphabetization\n3.  **F**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **H**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **M**ethoxy (-OCH3)\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **Cyano**. Now we compare the two numbering schemes based on the locant given to the \"cyano\" group.\n\n*   In **Numbering A**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n*   In **Numbering B**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Numbering A is the correct IUPAC numbering scheme.**\n\n### Step 6: Assemble the Final Name\nWe use the locants from the correct numbering scheme (Numbering A) and list the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **Correct Locants:** 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy\n*   **Alphabetical Assembly:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n\nFirst, we list all the functional groups present on the benzene ring:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, referred to as the 'formyl' group when a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules for priority of functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as locant number 1 (C1).\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description**\n\nLet's map out the positions of the other groups relative to C1:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   One of {C2, C6} is -OH (hydroxyl).\n    *   The other of {C2, C6} is -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The carboxylic acid is at C1. The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups must be at C3 and C5. Since C3 and C5 are also meta to each other, this condition is satisfied.\n    *   One of {C3, C5} is -CHO (formyl).\n    *   The other of {C3, C5} is -CN (cyano).\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: This is the key clue to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile group is -CN.\n    *   We know methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The -CN group must be ortho to C4, which means the -CN group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the -CN group's position:\n        *   **Scenario A: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C6.\n        *   **Scenario B: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4, which fits. This would mean the -OH group must be at C2.\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Numbering (Lowest Locant Rule)**\n\nWe now have two possible structures that fit the description. The next step is to number the ring according to IUPAC rules to decide which structure is correct. The primary rule is to assign numbers to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\nIn both scenarios, the substituents are located at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since this set of locants is the same for both possibilities, we have a tie.\nThe tie-breaking rule states that when a choice exists, numbering should be assigned to give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent names alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**. Therefore, the numbering should be chosen to give the 'cyano' group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). Since 3 is lower than 5, the cyano group must be at **C3**.\n\nThis confirms **Scenario B** is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Structure**\n\nBased on our deductions, the positions are:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (Since -CN is at C3, -OH must be at C2 to be ortho to it)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Gets the lower number, 3, based on alphabetization)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3\n*   **C5:** -CHO (The other meta position for the remaining group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (The other ortho position for the remaining group)\n\n**5. Construct the IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we assemble the name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)** (The parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name perfectly matches option B. Let's verify the other options:\n*   A) Not alphabetized correctly.\n*   C) This name corresponds to our rejected \"Scenario A\" where cyano is at C5, violating the lowest locant rule for alphabetically first substituent.\n*   D) Not alphabetized correctly.\n\nThus, the only correct IUPAC name based on the description and rules is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, I will break down the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Base Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all *meta* to one another. The simplest way to draw this is to place the main group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. Then, the other two groups would be at positions 3 and 5 to satisfy the *meta* relationship (1,3- and 1,5- relationships are meta; 3,5- is also meta).\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Carbaldehyde/Formyl)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n\n2.  **Add Substituents Relative to the Carboxylic Acid:**\n    *   *Ortho* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, these two groups are at C2 and C6, but we don't know which is which yet.\n    *   *Para* to the carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1) is a methoxy group (-OCH3). The para position is C4. So, the -OCH3 group is at C4.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguity:**\n    *   The description states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy (-OCH3) group at C4, which is consistent with this statement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho-to-COOH position, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group.\n\nThe final structure is now unambiguously determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 2. Determine the Parent Name\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Number the Benzene Ring\n\n*   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) is assigned **locant 1**.\n*   We need to number the remaining positions (2 through 6) to give the lowest possible set of locants to the other substituents. We can number either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Numbering clockwise:** Substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** Starting from C1, C6 would become C2, C5 would become C3, etc. The substituents would still be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   Since both directions yield the same locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use a tie-breaker rule. The rule states that we assign numbering to give the lowest locants to substituents cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize the Substituents\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them. Note that when naming, the carbaldehyde group (-CHO) is named \"formyl\" and the nitrile group (-CN) is named \"cyano\".\n*   -CN: **c**yano\n*   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n*   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n*   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n*   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n\nThe alphabetical order is: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n\n### 5. Apply the Numbering Tie-Breaker\n\nNow, let's compare the two numbering schemes based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\".\n\n*   **Clockwise Numbering:** Based on our drawing, the -N(CH3)2 is at C2 and the **-CN is at C5**.\n*   **Counter-clockwise Numbering:** The -OH would be at C2 and the **-CN would be at C3**.\n\nSince **3 is lower than 5**, the counter-clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\nThe correct locants for each substituent are:\n*   **2-hydroxy**\n*   **3-cyano**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **5-formyl**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)**\n\n### 6. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe list the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, and finish with the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano-\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)-\n3.  5-formyl-\n4.  2-hydroxy-\n5.  4-methoxy-\n6.  benzoic acid\n\nCombining these in the correct order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 7. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical ordering in the name)\n*   D) **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** (Matches our derived name)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Chemical Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a model of the molecule.\n-   **Core:** A benzene ring.\n-   **Highest Priority Group:** The problem lists a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which, according to IUPAC rules, is the highest priority among the given functional groups. This means the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n-   **Substituent Positions relative to C1 (-COOH):**\n    -   *ortho* (C2 and C6): one hydroxyl (-OH) group and one dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group.\n    -   *para* (C4): one methoxy (-OCH₃) group.\n-   **Meta-related groups:** The carboxylic acid (-COOH at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* to one another. This means they are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n-   **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH₃) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrile/cyano group (-CN).\n\nLet's use this information to determine the exact position of each substituent.\n1.  Place -COOH at **C1**.\n2.  Place -OCH₃ at **C4** (para to C1).\n3.  The -CHO and -CN groups are at **C3** and **C5**.\n4.  The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at **C2** and **C6**.\n5.  Now use the final constraint: -OCH₃ (at C4) and -OH are ortho to -CN.\n    -   The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So -CN must be at C3 or C5, which is consistent.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C3**. The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    -   Let's test if **-CN is at C5**. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since -OCH₃ is at C4, the -OH group must be at C6. This also works.\n\nWe have two potential arrangements which are actually the same molecule, just numbered differently from C1:\n-   **Arrangement A (Numbering Counter-Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂\n-   **Arrangement B (Numbering Clockwise):** C1-COOH, C2-N(CH₃)₂, C3-CHO, C4-OCH₃, C5-CN, C6-OH\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the remaining carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n-   In both Arrangement A and Arrangement B, the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n-   When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **c**yano (-CN)\n2.  **d**imethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n3.  **f**ormyl (-CHO)\n4.  **h**ydroxy (-OH)\n5.  **m**ethoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nNow let's compare the two numbering arrangements based on the position of the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano\":\n-   In Arrangement A (counter-clockwise), the cyano group is at **C3**.\n-   In Arrangement B (clockwise), the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the counter-clockwise numbering of Arrangement A is correct.\n\nSo, the correct assignment of substituents is:\n-   C1: -COOH\n-   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n-   C3: -CN (cyano)\n-   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n-   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n-   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n### 3. Assemble the Final Name\n\nTo write the final IUPAC name, list the substituents (with their locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n1.  **3-cyano**\n2.  **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for clarity with complex/substituted substituents)\n3.  **5-formyl**\n4.  **2-hydroxy**\n5.  **4-methoxy**\n\nCombining these parts alphabetically gives the name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 4. Compare with the Given Options\n\n-   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n-   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but prefixes are listed numerically, not alphabetically.*\n-   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *This exactly matches our derived name.*\n-   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and incorrect alphabetical order.*\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis problem requires a systematic approach to IUPAC nomenclature. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Identify Substituents and the Parent Ring\n*   **Parent Ring**: Benzene\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents**:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), named as a 'formyl' prefix.\n    *   Cyano (-CN), named as a 'cyano' prefix.\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), named as a 'hydroxy' prefix.\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\n### 2. Determine the Principal Functional Group\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the functional groups are ranked as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Nitrile > Aldehyde > Alcohol > Amine > Ether.\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule a **benzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring\n\n1.  **Assign C1**: The carbon atom attached to the principal group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Place the other groups based on the description**:\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Methoxy (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ groups are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Since -COOH is at C1, the -CHO and -CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n3.  **Use the final clue to fix the positions**:\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\".\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile group (-CN) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C5, its ortho positions would be C4 and C6.\n    *   If the -CN group were at C3, its ortho positions would be C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states that both the methoxy (-OCH₃ at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile.

Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Molecule**\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to build a structural representation of the molecule. We will use a temporary numbering system on a benzene ring to place the groups, which may not be the final IUPAC numbering.\n\n*   **Core structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Main groups:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group are all *meta* (1,3-positions) to one another. Let's place the primary functional group, the carboxylic acid, at position 1. This means the other two groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -CHO at C3\n    *   -CN at C5\n\n    ```\n        (C1)-COOH\n       /      \\\n     C6        C2\n    /          \\\n   (C5)-CN -- C4 -- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* (1,2-positions) to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* (1,4-position) to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n\n    Let's update the drawing with this information:\n    ```\n          (C1)-COOH\n         /         \\\n    (C6)-(OH/NMe2) (C2)-(NMe2/OH)\n      |                |\n    (C5)-CN -------- (C4)-OCH3 -------- (C3)-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Final positioning clue:** The methoxy group and the alcohol group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile group (-CN).\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The positions *ortho* to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is already at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This confirms its placement.\n    *   Therefore, the alcohol (-OH) must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This forces the remaining dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group to be at C2.\n\n**The final, unambiguous structure is:**\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**2. Determine the Parent Compound and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   **Parent Compound:** The IUPAC priority of functional groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > ... > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so the parent name is **benzoic acid**.\n*   **Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon atom bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) must be assigned locant 1 (C1).\n    *   We then number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the other substituents. We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-NMe2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. The locant set for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-NMe2. The locant set for the substituents is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, we choose the scheme that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**3. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Alphabetize the substituents:**\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino\n    3.  **F**ormyl (the prefix for a -CHO group when it's not the principal group)\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the tie-breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering direction that gives the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C5.\n    *   Clockwise numbering places the cyano group at C3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **we must use the clockwise numbering scheme**.\n\n*   **Assign the correct locants based on clockwise numbering:**\n    *   **hydroxy** is at C2\n    *   **cyano** is at C3\n    *   **methoxy** is at C4\n    *   **formyl** is at C5\n    *   **dimethylamino** is at C6\n\n*   **Construct the name:** List the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its correct locant, and then add the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order and numbering)\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes)\n\nThe correct name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has the highest priority among the given functional groups according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents based on the description:**\n    Let's denote the positions on the benzene ring from 1 to 6, starting with the carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\n    *   \"A carboxylic acid (at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all meta to one another.\"\n        *   The 'meta' positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, they must be arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern.\n        *   So, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups are at positions **C3 and C5**.\n\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2).\"\n        *   The 'ortho' positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6.\n        *   So, the **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino** groups are at positions **C2 and C6**.\n\n    *   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3).\"\n        *   The 'para' position relative to C1 is C4.\n        *   So, the **methoxy (-OCH3)** group is at position **C4**.\n\n    At this point, the ring is fully substituted, but we have pairs of substituents in undecided positions: {-OH, -N(CH3)2} at {C2, C6} and {-CHO, -CN} at {C3, C5}.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Positions:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n        *   The methoxy group is fixed at **C4**. For the nitrile (-CN) to be ortho to it, the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile. This is the key to solving the puzzle. Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile:\n            *   **Scenario 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the alcohol **(-OH) must be at C2**.\n            *   **Scenario 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the alcohol **(-OH) must be at C6**.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Scenarios:**\n    The primary IUPAC rule for numbering a ring is to assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents. In this case, the substituent locants are fixed at {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, regardless of the scenario. When the locant set is identical, we use a tie-breaker: we number the ring to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   The rule requires that 'cyano' gets the lowest possible locant. The available positions for the cyano group are C3 and C5. To minimize its locant, the **cyano group must be placed at C3**.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Structure:**\n    *   Since the cyano group is at C3, we must follow **Scenario 1** from step 3.\n    *   From Scenario 1, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2.\n    *   This forces the remaining substituents into their unique positions:\n        *   The dimethylamino group must be at C6 (the other ortho position).\n        *   The formyl group must be at C5 (the other meta position).\n\n    The definitive structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\n6.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now, write the full name by listing the substituent prefixes (with their determined locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\n    Combining these gives the final name:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect, substituents are not alphabetized)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect, uses the wrong numbering)\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect, uses the wrong numbering)\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThis problem requires us to systematically determine the structure of a substituted benzene molecule based on a detailed description and then correctly name it according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule**\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde / Formyl (-CHO)\n*   Cyano / Nitrile (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl / Alcohol (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of Substituents**\n\nWe are given the relative positions of all substituents. Let's place them on the benzene ring, starting with C1 for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **Para (to C1):** A methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4.\n    *   **C4: -OCH3**\n*   **Meta (to C1):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. The problem also states they are meta to each other, which C3 and C5 are. So, {C3, C5} must be {-CHO, -CN}.\n*   **Ortho (to C1):** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, {C2, C6} must be {-OH, -N(CH3)2}.\n*   **Key Constraint:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) must be ortho to it, so the -CN group must be at either C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (-OH, hydroxyl group) must also be ortho to the -CN group.\n    *   **Case 1: -CN is at C3.** It is ortho to C4 (-OCH3). For the -OH group to be ortho to it, the -OH group must be at C2. This works.\n    *   **Case 2: -CN is at C5.** It is ortho to C4 (-OCH3). For the -OH group to be ortho to it, the -OH group must be at C6. This also seems to work.\n\n**3. Resolve the Ambiguity using IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nAt first glance, it seems two different molecules could fit the description. However, the IUPAC naming system is designed to give a unique name to every molecule, which includes a specific numbering scheme.\n\n*   The principal group (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   The locants for the substituents will be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the arrangement. This creates a tie in the \"lowest locant set\" rule.\n*   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the locant set is a tie, we number the ring in the direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n1.  **cyano**\n2.  **dimethylamino**\n3.  **formyl** (the name for -CHO when it's a substituent)\n4.  **hydroxy**\n5.  **methoxy**\n\nThe first group alphabetically is **cyano**. Therefore, we must number the ring to give the cyano group the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). The correct numbering must assign the **C3** position to the cyano group.\n\nWith this rule, the structure is now uniquely determined:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C3:** -CN (to satisfy the numbering rule)\n*   **C2:** -OH (must be ortho to C3 based on the \"key constraint\")\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (para to C1)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (the other meta group)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n\nLet's verify this final structure against all statements:\n*   -COOH, -CHO (C5), -CN (C3) are all meta to one another. (Correct)\n*   -OH (C2) and -N(CH3)2 (C6) are ortho to -COOH. (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) is para to -COOH. (Correct)\n*   -OCH3 (C4) and -OH (C2) are both ortho to -CN (C3). (Correct)\n\nThe structure is confirmed.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nNow, we list the substituents (in alphabetical order) with their determined locants, followed by the parent name.\n\n*   cyano -> 3-cyano\n*   dimethylamino -> 6-(dimethylamino)\n*   formyl -> 5-formyl\n*   hydroxy -> 2-hydroxy\n*   methoxy -> 4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n**5.

Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:**\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, which has the highest priority among the given functional groups (carboxylic acid > aldehyde > nitrile > alcohol > amine > ether). Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the number **1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information:**\nWe will place the substituents on the benzene ring starting from C1 (the -COOH group).\n\n*   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": Para means position 4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at **C4**.\n*   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": Ortho means positions 2 and 6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at **C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is which.\n*   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": Meta means positions 3 and 5. The carboxylic acid is at C1. Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as \"formyl\") and the cyano (-CN) groups are at **C3 and C5**. We also don't know which is which. The meta relationship is confirmed: C1 is meta to C3 and C5; C3 is meta to C5.\n*   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\": This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities.\n    *   The methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) is at either C2 or C6.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the position of the nitrile:\n        *   **Case A:** If the nitrile is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the statement to be true, the methoxy group must be at C4 (which it is) and the alcohol group must be at C2. This works.\n        *   **Case B:** If the nitrile is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For the statement to be true, the methoxy group must be at C4 (which it is) and the alcohol group must be at C6. This also works.\n\n**3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Break the Tie:**\nThe description successfully describes two distinct molecules. IUPAC rules dictate that when such ambiguity arises, we must choose the numbering that gives the lowest set of locants to the substituents cited alphabetically.\n\n*   The substituents are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n*   The set of locant numbers is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for both potential structures. This rule doesn't resolve the tie.\n*   Therefore, we must apply the next rule: assign the lowest numbers to substituents in alphabetical order at the first point of difference.\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**: **C**yano, **D**imethylamino, **F**ormyl, **H**ydroxy, **M**ethoxy.\n\nLet's analyze the two possible structures derived from Case A and Case B:\n\n*   **Structure from Case A:**\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -OH at C2 (ortho to CN)\n    *   -CN at C3\n    *   -OCH3 at C4\n    *   -CHO at C5 (the other meta position)\n    *   -N(CH3)2 at C6 (the other ortho position)\n    *   **Locants in alphabetical order**: cyano (**3**), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxy (2), methoxy (4).\n    *   The locant set is **3, 6, 5, 2, 4**.\n\n*   **Structure from Case B:**\n    *   -COOH at C1\n    *   -OH at C6 (ortho to CN)\n    *   -CN at C5\n    *   -OCH3 at C4\n    *   -CHO at C3 (the other meta position)\n    *   -N(CH3)2 at C2 (the other ortho position)\n    *   **Locants in alphabetical order**: cyano (**5**), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4).\n    *   The locant set is **5, 2, 3, 6, 4**.\n\n*   **Comparison:** We compare the two locant sets: (**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4) vs (**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4). At the first point of difference, **3 is lower than 5**. Therefore, the numbering from Case A is the correct one.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Name:**\nUsing the substituent positions from Case A and listing them in alphabetical order:\n\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid** (parent name)\n\nCombining these gives the final name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and draw the structure:**\n    *   We start with a benzene ring.\n    *   The molecule has a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group, all *meta* to one another. This suggests a 1,3,5 substitution pattern for these three groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority for IUPAC naming, so we assign its position as C1. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   There is a methoxy group (-OCH3) *para* to the carboxylic acid, which places it at C4.\n    *   There is a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group, both *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This places them at C2 and C6.\n    *   Finally, we use the constraints relative to the nitrile (cyano group) to determine the exact arrangement:\n        *   The methoxy group (at C4) is *ortho* to the nitrile. This is true if the nitrile is at C3 or C5.\n        *   The hydroxyl group (alcohol) is also *ortho* to the nitrile.\n            *   **Scenario A:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C2 to be *ortho* to it. This leaves C5 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C6 for the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n            *   **Scenario B:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6 to be *ortho* to it. This leaves C3 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C2 for the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n2.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\n    *   The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n    *   In both Scenario A and Scenario B, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of which direction we number (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the set of locants is the same, we number the ring to give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n3.  **List and Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   -CN: **c**yano\n    *   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n    *   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n    *   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n    *   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n    The alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Numbering:**\n    *   Let's check our two scenarios against the tie-breaker rule. The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   In **Scenario A**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In **Scenario B**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scenario A** provides the correct numbering.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    *   The correct structure and numbering (from Scenario A) is:\n        *   C1: -COOH (benzoic acid)\n        *   C2: -OH (2-hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (3-cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (4-methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (5-formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (6-dimethylamino)\n    *   Now, we arrange the substituent names in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combining these alphabetically gives the prefix: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy**\n    *   Adding the parent name, the full IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   This name matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Structure:**\n    The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano (-CN), a hydroxyl (-OH), a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy (-OCH3) group on a benzene ring.\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among these. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    We will use the description to place each substituent on the benzene ring relative to C1.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH3):** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". This places the methoxy group at C4.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** \"meta to one another\" and both are \"meta to the carboxylic acid\". This means these three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the ring. Since COOH is at C1, the CHO and CN groups must be at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups:** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". This places these two groups at C2 and C6.\n\n    At this point, we have the basic layout:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   {C2, C6}: one is -OH, the other is -N(CH3)2\n    *   {C3, C5}: one is -CHO, the other is -CN\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure:**\n    The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4.\n    *   Alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   Nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the position of the nitrile group:\n    *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n        *   The methoxy group (at C4) is indeed ortho to C3. This fits.\n        *   For the alcohol (-OH) to be ortho to the nitrile (at C3), the -OH group must be at C2 (since C2 is ortho to C3, but C6 is para to C3).\n        *   This configuration forces the remaining groups into their places: The -N(CH3)2 group must be at C6, and the -CHO group must be at C5.\n        *   Structure for Case 1: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n\n    *   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n        *   The methoxy group (at C4) is indeed ortho to C5. This fits.\n        *   For the alcohol (-OH) to be ortho to the nitrile (at C5), the -OH group must be at C6 (since C6 is ortho to C5, but C2 is meta to C5).\n        *   This configuration forces the remaining groups into their places: The -N(CH3)2 group must be at C2, and the -CHO group must be at C3.\n        *   Structure for Case 2: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to find the Correct Name:**\n    Now we have two possible structures that both fit the description. Let's see how they are named according to IUPAC rules. The primary rule after fixing C1 is to number the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents. Since all other positions (2,3,4,5,6) are substituted, the locant set will be {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of direction. In this situation, we use alphabetical order to break the tie. We give the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n    The substituents to consider are **d**imethylamino and **h**ydroxy at the C2/C6 positions.\n    *   Since 'd' comes before 'h' alphabetically, the **dimethylamino** group must be assigned the lower locant.\n\n    Let's analyze both structures based on this rule:\n    *   **Naming for Structure from Case 1:** The groups at C2/C6 are -OH (C2) and -N(CH3)2 (C6). To give dimethylamino the lower locant, we must number counter-clockwise, which would make the -N(CH3)2 group C2 and the -OH group C6. This renumbering makes the structure identical to the structure derived in Case 2.\n    *   **Naming for Structure from Case 2:** The groups at C2/C6 are -N(CH3)2 (C2) and -OH (C6). The dimethylamino group already has the lower locant (2), so this numbering is correct.\n\n    Therefore, there is only one valid molecule once IUPAC rules are applied, and its structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3: -CHO\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CN\n    *   C6: -OH\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    List the substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their locant number.\n    *   **C**yano: 5-cyano\n    *   **D**imethylamino: 2-(dimethylamino)\n    *   **F**ormyl: 3-formyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy: 6-hydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy: 4-methoxy\n\n    Combine these in alphabetical order before the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    The correct IUPAC name is: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed alphabetically in the name.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetical order.\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group**\nThe molecule is based on a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules for functional groups, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant (position) **1**.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the Positional Information to Build the Structure**\nLet's map out the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting from C1 (-COOH).\n\n1.  **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1. The positions meta to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   This means the carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and cyano (-CN, prefix \"cyano\") groups are at positions C3 and C5.\n\n2.  **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino...\"**\n    *   The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH, prefix \"hydroxy\") and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2, prefix \"dimethylamino\") groups are at positions C2 and C6.\n\n3.  **\"...and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para to C1 is C4.\n    *   This means the methoxy (-OCH3, prefix \"methoxy\") group is at position C4.\n\n4.  **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   This is the key piece of information that determines the exact arrangement. The \"alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group, and the \"nitrile\" is the cyano group.\n    *   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   We have two possibilities from point 1: the cyano group is at C3 or C5.\n    *   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at C3, the positions ortho to it are C2 and C4. The description says methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl must be ortho. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This leads to the following structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho group)\n    *   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. The description says methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl must be ortho. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This leads to the structure's other enantiomer (mirror image). For naming purposes, the constitution (connectivity) is what we need, and both cases describe the same constitution, just numbered in opposite directions around the ring.\n\nSo, the unique molecular constitution is established. Let's use the arrangement from Case A for the next step.\n*   C1: -COOH, C2: -OH, C3: -CN, C4: -OCH3, C5: -CHO, C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n**Step 3: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\nThe final name depends on the correct numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) to give the lowest possible set of locants.\n\n1.  The principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1.\n2.  All other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are substituted, so the locant set for the substituents as a whole is {2,3,4,5,6} regardless of the numbering direction.\n3.  When there is a tie, we choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest locant set to the substituents when they are arranged in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n    *   Now, let's find the locant for each of these substituents for the two possible numbering directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) of our established structure.\n\n    *   **Numbering Direction 1 (Clockwise):**\n        *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino\n        *   Let's create the locant set based on the alphabetical order of prefixes:\n            *   cyano: 3\n            *   dimethylamino: 6\n            *   formyl: 5\n            *   hydroxy: 2\n            *   methoxy: 4\n        *   **Locant Set 1: [3, 6, 5, 2, 4]**\n\n    *   **Numbering Direction 2 (Counter-Clockwise):**\n        *   This direction would assign C2 to the dimethylamino group and C6 to the hydroxyl group, etc. The locants would be:\n        *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy\n        *   Let's create the locant set based on the alphabetical order of prefixes:\n            *   cyano: 5\n            *   dimethylamino: 2\n            *   formyl: 3\n            *   hydroxy: 6\n            *   methoxy: 4\n        *   **Locant Set 2: [5, 2, 3, 6, 4]**\n\n4.  Compare the two locant sets lexicographically (at the first point of difference).\n    *   Compare Locant Set 1 ([**3**, 6, 5, 2, 4]) with Locant Set 2 ([**5**, 2, 3, 6, 4]).\n    *   The first number in Set 1 is 3, and in Set 2 is 5. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Numbering Direction 1 is the correct one.**\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering (Numbering Direction 1), we assemble the full IUPAC name. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant.\n\n*   **c**yano is at C3 -> **3-cyano**\n*   **d**imethylamino is at C6 -> **6-(dimethylamino)**\n*   **f**ormyl is at C5 -> **5-formyl**\n*   **h**ydroxy is at C2 -> **2-hydroxy**\n*   **m**ethoxy is at C4 -> **4-methoxy**\n*   Parent name -> **benzoic acid**\n\nPutting it all together:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThis problem requires the systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO, also known as formyl as a substituent)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH₃)\n\nAccording to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Positions of Substituents and Number the Ring\n\nWe are given the following positional information:\n1.  The carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all **meta** to one another. Since the carboxylic acid is at C1, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be at positions C3 and C5.\n2.  The hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid. This places them at positions C2 and C6.\n3.  The methoxy group is **para** to the carboxylic acid. This places it at position C4.\n4.  A crucial piece of information: The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group (at C2 or C6) are both **ortho** to the cyano group.\n    *   For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our first point.\n    *   For the hydroxyl group to be ortho to the cyano group, we must test the two possibilities:\n        *   **Case A:** If the cyano group is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the methoxy is already at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2.\n        *   **Case B:** If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the methoxy is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n\nThis gives us two possible structures for the substituents on the benzoic acid ring:\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from Case A):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from Case B):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Lowest Locant Rule\n\nBoth potential numbering schemes give the exact same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must use the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n### Step 4: Alphabetize Substituents and Select the Correct Numbering\n\nLet's list the substituents and alphabetize them:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino (prefixes like 'di', 'tri' are not used for alphabetization unless they are part of a complex substituent name, but 'dimethylamino' is treated as a whole, starting with 'd')\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare our two structures based on the locant given to the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\":\n*   In Structure 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Structure 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Structure 1** represents the correct numbering scheme.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the Final IUPAC Name\n\nUsing Structure 1, we list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its locant number, and append the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining them in alphabetical order gives:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering, corresponds to Structure 2)\nB) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Correct)\nC) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\nD) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule:**\n    The functional groups present are carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde/formyl (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n    According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is assigned the number 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents:**\n    We will place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the relative positions given in the question. Let's start drawing the structure with the C1 as the carboxylic acid group.\n\n    *   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\"**: The para position to C1 is C4. So, a methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4.\n    *   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**: The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\"**: The -COOH is at C1. The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, a formyl (-CHO) group and a cyano (-CN) group are at C3 and C5.\n    *   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\"**: The nitrile (-CN) group must be ortho to both the methoxy group (-OCH3) and the hydroxyl/alcohol group (-OH).\n        *   We know -OCH3 is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the -CN group must be at C3 or C5.\n        *   We also know the -OH group is at C2 or C6.\n        *   Let's test if the -CN group can be at C3. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. If -CN is at C3, then C4 (-OCH3) and C2 (-OH) must be the positions for the methoxy and hydroxyl groups. This fits our previous deductions perfectly.\n        *   Let's test if the -CN group can be at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. If -CN is at C5, then C4 (-OCH3) and C6 (-OH) must be the positions for the methoxy and hydroxyl groups. This also works.\n\n3.  **Establish the Final Structure and Numbering:**\n    We have two possible numbering schemes that describe the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions.\n    *   **Scheme 1**: -CN at C3. This leads to: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH3, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH3)2.\n    *   **Scheme 2**: -CN at C5. This leads to: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH.\n\n    Both schemes result in the same set of locants for the substituents: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When two numbering schemes yield the same lowest locant set, IUPAC rules state that the lowest number should be assigned to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    The substituent prefixes are:\n    *   cyano\n    *   dimethylamino\n    *   formyl\n    *   hydroxy\n    *   methoxy\n\n    According to IUPAC rules, the prefix \"di\" in \"dimethylamino\" is included for alphabetization because it's part of a composite substituent name. Therefore, we alphabetize based on 'd'.\n    The correct alphabetical order is:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n5.  **Apply the Tie-breaker Rule and Finalize the Name:**\n    The first substituent in the alphabetical list is \"cyano\". To satisfy the tie-breaker rule, \"cyano\" must be given the lowest possible locant.\n    *   In Scheme 1, the cyano group is at C3.\n    *   In Scheme 2, the cyano group is at C5.\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, we must use **Scheme 1**.\n\n    The correct positions for the substituents are:\n    *   C2: hydroxy\n    *   C3: cyano\n    *   C4: methoxy\n    *   C5: formyl\n    *   C6: dimethylamino\n\n    Now, we construct the final name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name.\n\n    3-cyano-6-dimethylamino-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n    This name matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify all groups and the parent structure:**\n    *   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   `-COOH` (carboxylic acid)\n        *   `-CHO` (carbaldehyde, named as \"formyl\" prefix)\n        *   `-CN` (cyano group/nitrile, named as \"cyano\" prefix)\n        *   `-OH` (hydroxyl group, named as \"hydroxy\" prefix)\n        *   `-N(CH3)2` (dimethylamino group)\n        *   `-OCH3` (methoxy group)\n\n2.  **Determine the principal functional group:**\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) has the highest priority among all the groups present. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the `-COOH` group is assigned the number 1 (C1).\n\n3.  **Draw the structure by placing the substituents according to the description:**\n    *   Start with benzoic acid, placing the `-COOH` group at C1.\n    *   \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" Meta positions are 1,3,5 relative to each other. With `-COOH` at C1, the `-CHO` and `-CN` groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\" The para position to C1 is C4. So, `-OCH3` is at C4.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.\" The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, `-OH` and `-N(CH3)2` are at C2 and C6.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" This is the key constraint that fixes the relative positions. The methoxy group is at C4.\n        *   **Scenario 1:** Let's assume the nitrile (`-CN`) is at C3. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since `-OCH3` is at C4, the alcohol (`-OH`) must be at C2. This means `-N(CH3)2` must be at C6, and `-CHO` must be at C5.\n        *   **Scenario 2:** Let's assume the nitrile (`-CN`) is at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. Since `-OCH3` is at C4, the alcohol (`-OH`) must be at C6. This means `-N(CH3)2` must be at C2, and `-CHO` must be at C3.\n\n    Note that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 describe the exact same molecule, just viewed from different perspectives (they are mirror images that can be superimposed by rotation in the plane, as the molecule is achiral). Let's proceed with the structure from Scenario 1 to determine the name.\n\n    **Structure (based on Scenario 1):**\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH\n    *   C3: -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   C5: -CHO\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2\n\n4.  **Number the ring according to IUPAC rules:**\n    *   The carbon with the `-COOH` group is C1.\n    *   We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the other substituents. The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Numbering clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1 both result in the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   When the locant sets are identical, we must use alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes to decide the numbering direction. The direction that gives a lower number to the first point of difference in the alphabetical list of substituents is chosen.\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Let's check the two numbering directions for our determined structure:\n        *   **Direction A (Clockwise, as drawn):** C2 is -OH, C3 is -CN, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CHO, C6 is -N(CH3)2.\n        *   **Direction B (Counter-clockwise):** C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, C4 is -OCH3, C5 is -CN, C6 is -OH.\n    *   Now, we create the locant sequences based on the alphabetical order of prefixes (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy):\n        *   **Sequence for Direction A:** {3, 6, 5, 2, 4}\n        *   **Sequence for Direction B:** {5, 2, 3, 6, 4}\n    *   Compare the sequences term by term: The first term of Sequence A is 3, and for Sequence B it is 5. Since 3 < 5, Direction A provides the lower locant set according to the rules.\n\n5.  **Construct the final name:**\n    *   Using the correct numbering from Direction A, the positions are:\n        *   `3-cyano`\n        *   `6-(dimethylamino)`\n        *   `5-formyl`\n        *   `2-hydroxy`\n        *   `4-methoxy`\n    *   Now, arrange these prefixes in alphabetical order and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n    *   The correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived name matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Group:** Let's identify the functional group with the highest priority to determine the parent name and assign it to position 1 (C1). The functional groups are: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**, and the -COOH group is on C1.\n3.  **Place Substituents based on relative positions to C1:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde, and cyano group are *meta* to one another. Meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. So, the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are on C3 and C5.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is on C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH3)2 are on C2 and C6.\n\n    At this point, the partial structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   Positions {C2, C6} have {-OH, -N(CH3)2}\n    *   Positions {C3, C5} have {-CHO, -CN}\n\n4.  **Use the final clue to determine the exact positions:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. The nitrile (-CN) must be in one of these positions.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **If -CN is at C5:** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. We know -OCH3 is at C4. This means the -OH group must be at C6. This works.\n        *   **If -CN is at C3:** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. We know -OCH3 is at C4. This means the -OH group must be at C2. This also works.\n\n    However, only one of these structures can be correct based on the fixed description. Let's re-read \"ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\". It seems there's no preference given. Ah, but wait, the description logically builds the molecule. Let's assume the final piece of information *uniquely* determines the structure.\n\n    Let's choose the C3 position for the Nitrile for our test.\n    *   If -CN is at C3. Then to satisfy the condition, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2 (since methoxy is at C4).\n    *   This places the remaining substituents: Since -OH is at C2, -N(CH3)2 must be at C6. Since -CN is at C3, -CHO must be at C5.\n\n    Let's check this final structure against all conditions:\n    *   **Structure:** C1: -COOH, C2: -OH, C3: -CN, C4: -OCH3, C5: -CHO, C6: -N(CH3)2\n    *   -COOH, -CHO (at 5), -CN (at 3) are all meta? Yes.\n    *   -OH (at 2) and -N(CH3)2 (at 6) are ortho to -COOH? Yes.\n    *   -OCH3 (at 4) is para to -COOH? Yes.\n    *   -OCH3 (at 4) and -OH (at 2) are ortho to -CN (at 3)? Yes.\n    \n    This structure perfectly and uniquely satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Correct Numbering\n\n1.  **Fixed Position:** C1 is assigned to the -COOH group.\n2.  **Numbering Direction:** We can number the ring clockwise or counter-clockwise. We must choose the direction that follows IUPAC rules.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering:** C2=-OH, C3=-CN, C4=-OCH3, C5=-CHO, C6=-N(CH3)2. The set of locants (positions of substituents) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C2=-N(CH3)2, C3=-CHO, C4=-OCH3, C5=-CN, C6=-OH. The set of locants is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaker Rule:** Since both numbering directions give the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituent names as a tie-breaker. The numbering that gives the lowest locant to the first substituent in alphabetical order is chosen.\n4.  **Apply the Tie-Breaker:**\n    *   The substituent prefixes, alphabetized, are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   Let's check the locant for \"cyano\" in each numbering scheme:\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise numbering scheme is correct.**\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\n1.  **Numbering is set:** C1:-COOH, C2:-OH, C3:-CN, C4:-OCH3, C5:-CHO, C6:-N(CH3)2.\n2.  **Identify prefixes with locants:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-dimethylamino (parentheses are used for complex substituents like this)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n3.  **Arrange prefixes alphabetically:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n4.  **Combine with the parent name:** 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect order of prefixes)\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Matches our derived name perfectly)\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Results from incorrect counter-clockwise numbering)\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect numbering and ordering)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a systematic approach to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description to place the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n2.  **Highest Priority Group:** The highest priority functional group mentioned is the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this group defines the parent name as **benzoic acid** and the carbon it's attached to is designated as **C1**.\n3.  **Groups meta to each other:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl), and cyano (-CN) are all meta to one another. If -COOH is at C1, the other two must be at C3 and C5.\n4.  **Substituents relative to Carboxylic Acid (C1):**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This places them at C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n5.  **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (cyano, -CN) group.\n    *   \"Ortho to the nitrile\" means the substituents are on adjacent carbons to the carbon with the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the positions of -CN and -CHO (C3 and C5).\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are here. This fits perfectly, as the hydroxyl group must be at C2 (or C6). Therefore, the -OH group is at C2.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The description says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are here. This would place the -OH group at C6.\n\nBoth cases result in valid structures that are mirror images (enantiomers) of each other. However, IUPAC naming conventions will lead to a single, unambiguous name (ignoring stereochemistry, which is not specified). Let's proceed with the structure derived from Case A.\n\nThe resulting substitution pattern is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the problem description.\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** As established, it is **benzoic acid**.\n2.  **Numbering:** The carbon with the -COOH group is C1. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n    *   Numbering **clockwise** gives the locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Numbering **counter-clockwise** would mean C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, etc. This also gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n    *   Now, compare the two numbering directions based on the locant of the first substituent in this list ('cyano').\n        *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), **C3(-CN)**... 'Cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), **C5(-CN)**... 'Cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise** numbering scheme must be used.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name:** Using the clockwise numbering, we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants, followed by the parent name.\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n\nCombining them in alphabetical order yields:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.*\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and prefix order.*\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived IUPAC name.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule is a derivative of a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde/Formyl (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. The priority order for these groups is:\nCarboxylic acid > Cyano > Carbaldehyde > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.**\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, a **methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4**.\n\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.**\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a **hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at C2 and which is at C6.\n\n*   **A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.**\n    *   This implies a 1,3,5 substitution pattern. Since -COOH is at C1, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   **The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.**\n    *   This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile (-CN) group is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the position of the cyano group:\n\n    **Case A: The cyano (-CN) group is at C3.**\n    *   The substituents ortho to C3 are at C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   We already placed methoxy at C4, which is indeed ortho to C3. This is consistent.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group must be at the other ortho position, which is C2.\n    *   If -OH is at C2, then the dimethylamino group must be at C6 (as C2 and C6 have one of each).\n    *   If -CN is at C3, then the carbaldehyde (-CHO) must be at C5 (as C3 and C5 have one of each).\n\n    This leads to the following structure (Structure I):\n    *   **C1: -COOH**\n    *   **C2: -OH (hydroxy)**\n    *   **C3: -CN (cyano)**\n    *   **C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)**\n    *   **C5: -CHO (formyl)**\n    *   **C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)**\n\n    **Case B: The cyano (-CN) group is at C5.**\n    *   The substituents ortho to C5 are at C4 and C6.\n    *   The description states methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C5. Consistent.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n    *   This would place the dimethylamino group at C2 and the carbaldehyde at C3. This gives Structure II.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe have two potential structures (I and II) that fit the description. They are constitutional isomers. However, IUPAC rules provide a unique name. Let's analyze the numbering. C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\nThe substituents are at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} in both cases. When the set of locants is identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The lowest locants are assigned to the substituents cited first in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Now let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, gets in each numbering scheme.\n    *   In the numbering that gives **Structure I**, the **cyano** group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the numbering that gives **Structure II**, the **cyano** group is at **C5**.\n\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme that leads to **Structure I is the correct one.**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe use the correct structure (Structure I) and its numbering.\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents and positions:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nFinally, we arrange the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)\n3.  5-formyl\n4.  2-hydroxy\n5.  4-methoxy\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.*\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes in the name.*\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Substituents**\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** The core is a benzene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   Carboxylic acid: -COOH\n    *   Carbaldehyde: -CHO (named as a prefix 'formyl')\n    *   Cyano group: -CN (named as a prefix 'cyano')\n    *   Hydroxyl group: -OH (named as a prefix 'hydroxy')\n    *   Dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂ (named as a prefix 'dimethylamino')\n    *   Methoxy group: -OCH₃ (named as a prefix 'methoxy')\n\n**2. Determine the Principal Functional Group**\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, functional groups are ranked in priority to determine the parent name of the molecule. The priority order for the groups present is:\nCarboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether\nThe carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid.\n\n**3. Draw the Structure and Number the Ring**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We will build the structure on a benzene ring based on the relative positions given.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Assign C1.** The carbon atom attached to the principal functional group (-COOH) is designated as C1.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Place the groups relative to C1.**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. Para is position 4 relative to C1. So, -OCH₃ is on C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. Ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, -OH and -N(CH₃)₂ are on C2 and C6 (we don't know which is where yet).\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. Meta positions are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are on C3 and C5 (again, we need more information to place them).\n\n*   **Step 3c: Use the final constraint to resolve ambiguity.**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   We know the methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   We know the alcohol (-OH) is at either C2 or C6.\n    *   We know the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case 1: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile. For this to be true, the alcohol must be at C2. This works perfectly.\n        *   **Case 2: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (at C4) and the alcohol to be ortho to the nitrile, the alcohol must be at C6. This also works.\n\n*   **Step 3d: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules.**\n    We have two potential numbering schemes which are mirror images of each other. We must number the ring starting from C1 to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n\n    *   **Scheme 1 (from Case 1):** Numbering clockwise gives:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH\n        *   C3: -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CHO\n        *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    *   **Scheme 2 (from Case 2):** Numbering counter-clockwise gives:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   C3: -CHO\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n        *   C5: -CN\n        *   C6: -OH\n        *   Locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    Since both numbering directions yield the same locant set, we use a tie-breaker rule: The numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in alphabetical order.\n\n**4. Alphabetize Substituents and Finalize Numbering**\n\n*   The substituent prefixes are: `cyano`, `dimethylamino`, `formyl`, `hydroxy`, `methoxy`.\n*   In alphabetical order:\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino (alphabetized under 'd')\n    3.  **F**ormyl\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n*   Now we compare the locants for the first group in the alphabetical list, \"cyano\":\n    *   In Scheme 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scheme 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scheme 1 is the correct IUPAC numbering.**\n\nThe correct assignments are:\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   3-cyano\n*   4-methoxy\n*   5-formyl\n*   6-dimethylamino\n\n**5. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name**\n\nList the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   **3-cyano**-\n*   **6-dimethylamino**-\n*   **5-formyl**-\n*   **2-hydroxy**-\n*   **4-methoxy**-\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining them:\n`3-cyano-6-dimethylamino-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid`\n(Note: IUPAC recommendations often place parentheses around complex substituent names like dimethylamino for clarity, making it 6-(dimethylamino)).\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid -> Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid -> Prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n*   **C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** -> This name correctly lists the substituents in alphabetical order (cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy) and uses the correct locants (3, 6, 5, 2, 4) based on IUPAC rules.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid -> Prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Substituents and Their Prefixes:**\n    *   -CHO (carbaldehyde): **formyl**\n    *   -CN (cyano): **cyano**\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl): **hydroxy**\n    *   -N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino): **dimethylamino**\n    *   -OCH3 (methoxy): **methoxy**\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Substituents based on the Description:**\n    Let's place the parent -COOH group at C1 of the benzene ring.\n\n    *   *\"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"*\n        This means these three groups are in a 1, 3, 5 relationship. With -COOH at C1, the formyl and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n    *   *\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino...\"*\n        The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6.\n\n    *   *\"...and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"*\n        The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n\n    At this point, the skeleton is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n    *   {C3, C5}: one is -CHO, one is -CN\n    *   {C2, C6}: one is -OH, one is -N(CH3)2\n\n4.  **Use the Final Clue to Resolve the Ambiguities:**\n    *   *\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"* (Note: alcohol = hydroxyl, nitrile = cyano).\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. The nitrile group is either at C3 or C5. Let's test these two possibilities.\n\n    *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. For the clue to be true, the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group must be at C2 and C4. We know methoxy is at C4, which fits. This forces the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be at **C2**.\n        *   This leads to the following structure (let's call it **Structure A**):\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C2: -OH (as determined above)\n            *   C3: -CN (our assumption for this case)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (given as para to COOH)\n            *   C5: -CHO (the other meta position)\n            *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho position)\n        This structure is fully consistent with all parts of the description.\n\n    *   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. For the clue to be true, the methoxy and hydroxyl groups must be at C4 and C6. We know methoxy is at C4, which fits. This forces the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be at **C6**.\n        *   This leads to the following structure (let's call it **Structure B**):\n            *   C1: -COOH\n            *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (the other ortho position)\n            *   C3: -CHO (the other meta position)\n            *   C4: -OCH3 (given as para to COOH)\n            *   C5: -CN (our assumption for this case)\n            *   C6: -OH (as determined above)\n        This structure is also fully consistent with all parts of the description.\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Tie-Breaking Rules to Choose Between the Two Valid Structures:**\n    The descriptive text is ambiguous and describes two possible molecules (Structure A and Structure B). To determine the single correct name, we must apply IUPAC's tie-breaking rule for numbering. When there is a choice, we number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents when cited in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   First, list the substituents alphabetically: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Now, we create the list of locants for these substituents for each structure.\n\n    *   **For Structure A:**\n        *   cyano is at **3**\n        *   dimethylamino is at **6**\n        *   formyl is at **5**\n        *   hydroxy is at **2**\n        *   methoxy is at **4**\n        *   Locant set (in alphabetical order of substituents): (3, 6, 5, 2, 4)\n\n    *   **For Structure B:**\n        *   cyano is at **5**\n        *   dimethylamino is at **2**\n        *   formyl is at **3**\n        *   hydroxy is at **6**\n        *   methoxy is at **4**\n        *   Locant set (in alphabetical order of substituents): (5, 2, 3, 6, 4)\n\n    *   Now, compare the two locant sets term by term: `(3, 6, 5, 2, 4)` vs `(5, 2, 3, 6, 4)`.\n    *   At the first point of difference (the first number in each set), `3` is less than `5`.\n    *   Therefore, the set of locants from **Structure A** is preferred. This means Structure A is the correct molecule to be named according to IUPAC rules.\n\n6.  **Write the Final IUPAC Name for Structure A:**\n    *   Structure A has the following substituents and positions: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The parent name is benzoic acid.\n    *   Arrange the substituents alphabetically in the name.\n    *   The correct name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Matches our derived name**)\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect alphabetical order)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (This is the name for Structure B, which is disfavored by IUPAC rules)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the description and draw the structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the words into a chemical structure. Let's place the primary functional group, carboxylic acid, at position C1 of the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Principal Group:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Groups meta to each other:** The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano group (-CN) are all meta to one another. Meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three to be mutually meta, they must be at positions C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n\n*   **Substituents relative to the carboxylic acid:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the -COOH group. Ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, {-OH, -N(CH3)2} are at {C2, C6}.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the -COOH group. The para position to C1 is C4. So, -OCH3 is at C4.\n\nAt this point, the skeleton looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: One is -OH, the other is -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: One is -CN, the other is -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n*   **Final Constraints (The key to solving the puzzle):** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. So the nitrile (-CN) must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with what we already know.\n    *   The alcohol group (-OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile (-CN). The -OH is at C2 or C6. Let's test the possibilities:\n        *   **If -CN is at C3**, the ortho positions are C2 and C4. Since the -OH group must be at C2 or C6, it must be at **C2** to be ortho to the -CN at C3.\n        *   **If -CN is at C5**, the ortho positions are C4 and C6. Since the -OH group must be at C2 or C6, it must be at **C6** to be ortho to the -CN at C5.\n\nThis seems to create two possible structures. However, IUPAC naming conventions will resolve this. The rules require us to number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to substituents, with ties broken by alphabetical order of the substituent names.\n\nLet's prioritize the numbering based on alphabetical order of the prefixes: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy. The prefix 'cyano' comes first alphabetically. Therefore, the cyano group should be assigned the lowest possible number (either 3 or 5). The lowest number is 3.\n\nThis forces the following placements:\n*   The **-CN** group must be at **C3**.\n*   This implies the **-CHO** group is at **C5**.\n*   Since -CN is at C3, the -OH group must be at the ortho position **C2**.\n*   This implies the **-N(CH3)2** group is at **C6**.\n\nSo, the definitive structure is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the description.\n\n### 2. Assemble the IUPAC Name\n\nNow we assemble the name based on this structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid\n2.  **Substituents and their locants:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino) (parentheses are used for complex substituent names)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n3.  **Alphabetize the prefixes:** The prefixes are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy.\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n4.  **Combine:** Combine the alphabetized prefixes before the parent name.\n\nThe final name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\n*   **A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid** - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This uses incorrect numbering (it would arise from numbering clockwise, which violates the lowest-locant rule for alphabetical prefixes).\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - The prefixes are not listed in alphabetical order.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - The prefixes are not listed in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
