F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\nD reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nwhat is the molecular symmetry group of E?\n\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on the chemical reactions provided, the identities of the substances are deduced as follows:\n\n*   **A**: I₂ (Iodine)\n*   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   **C**: I₂Cl₆ (Iodine trichloride dimer), a bright yellow/red solid.\n*   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   **E**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   **F**: HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   **G**: HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n*   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\nHere is the breakdown of the reactions:\n\n*   **Reaction 1**: I₂(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s). While the problem states 8 equivalents of gas B, the other reactions strongly support this chemical scheme. The stoichiometry in the riddle is likely a red herring or an error. I₂Cl₆ is a bright yellow solid that can appear reddish upon exposure to light.\n*   **Reaction 2**: I₂Cl₆(s) + 2CO(g) → 2COCl₂(g) + I₂(s). This reaction produces product E, phosgene (COCl₂), which is known to be extremely hazardous.\n*   **Reaction 3**: The hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (the monomer of C) produces iodine, hydrochloric acid, and iodic acid (5ICl₃ + 9H₂O → 15HCl + I₂ + 3HIO₃). This matches the description of reforming solid A (I₂) and producing a strong acid F (HCl) and a weaker acid G (HIO₃).\n*   **Reaction 4**: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g). This 1:1 reaction between gas D (CO) and gas B (Cl₂) forms phosgene (H), which is used as a solvent and reagent in industrial chemistry.\n\nThe extremely hazardous product E is identified as phosgene (COCl₂). To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must look at its structure. Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms, resulting in a trigonal planar molecular geometry.\n\nThe symmetry elements of the COCl₂ molecule are:\n*   A C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n*   Two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and solve the puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:**\n    *   Clue 4 states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\" Both B and D are gases.\n    *   A well-known reaction between two common gases that forms a liquid solvent is the synthesis of phosgene:\n        CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid (boiling point 8 °C) and can be used as a solvent in organic chemistry.\n    *   This allows us to tentatively identify H as phosgene (COCl₂), and the pair {B, D} as {CO, Cl₂}.\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:**\n    *   We have two possibilities for B and D. Let's test them.\n    *   **Case 1: B = CO and D = Cl₂.**\n        *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8CO(g) → C(red). C would be a metal carbonyl.\n        *   Clue 2: C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls does not typically produce two different acids. This case is unlikely.\n    *   **Case 2: B = Cl₂ and D = CO.**\n        *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red).\n        *   Let's consider what solid A could be. Sulfur exists as a solid, S₈. The reaction of sulfur with chlorine is:\n            S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry if we interpret \"product C\" as the substance SCl₂, even though 8 moles are formed. Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a cherry-red liquid. This is a very good match for C.\n        *   So, let's assume: **A = S₈**, **B = Cl₂**, and **C = SCl₂**.\n        *   Clue 2: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.\n        *   Let's check the hydrolysis of SCl₂:\n            2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S(s)\n        *   This reaction reforms elemental sulfur (A). It produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid (F). It also produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (G).\n        *   This fits perfectly. **F = HCl** and **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n3.  **Identify E:**\n    *   We have identified:\n        *   C = SCl₂ (sulfur dichloride)\n        *   D = CO (carbon monoxide)\n    *   Clue 3 states: \"C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2CO → E\n    *   Let's consider a plausible reaction. A balanced chemical equation is:\n        SCl₂ + 2CO → CSCl₂ + CO₂\n    *   This reaction produces thiophosgene (CSCl₂) and carbon dioxide. Thiophosgene is an extremely hazardous and toxic substance, fitting the description of E.\n    *   Therefore, **E = CSCl₂** (thiophosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the point group of E = CSCl₂.\n    *   Thiophosgene has a planar trigonal structure, similar to phosgene. The carbon atom is central, double-bonded to the sulfur atom and single-bonded to the two chlorine atoms.\n        ```\n           Cl\n            \\\n             C = S\n            /\n           Cl\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has the following symmetry elements:\n        *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=S bond.\n        *   A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n        *   A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (CSCl₂) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for several unknown substances (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H).\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(acid, strong) + G(acid, weak)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n5.  **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D∞h, B) C2, C) D4h, D) C2v.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Most Constraining Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 (Hydrolysis of C):** This is the most chemically specific clue. The reaction of C with water regenerates the solid starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The fact that A is reformed suggests that A is an element (likely a metal or metalloid) that is part of a complex or unstable compound C, and is released in its elemental form upon hydrolysis.\n    *   The formation of two different acids implies that the part of C that is not A (which comes from gas B) must contain at least two different non-metal elements that form acids upon hydrolysis.\n\n*   **A Plausible Chemical System for Clue 3:** A well-known reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (ICl₃).\n    *   5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → I₂(s) + 15 HCl(aq) + 3 HIO₃(aq)\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   **A = I₂** (Iodine is a solid at standard conditions). A is reformed.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid).\n        *   **G = HIO₃** (Iodic acid is a weaker acid than HCl).\n    *   This system perfectly matches the description in Clue 3. Let's tentatively identify these substances.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nIf A = I₂, F = HCl, and G = HIO₃, then C must be an iodine chloride. The formula for iodine trichloride is ICl₃, which exists as a dimer, **I₂Cl₆**, a bright yellow solid. We will assume \"bright red\" is a slight inaccuracy or refers to a similar compound, and proceed with C = I₂Cl₆.\n\n*   **Clue 1 (Formation of C):** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C\n    *   I₂(s) + B(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)\n    *   The balanced reaction is I₂(s) + 3 Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s).\n    *   This implies that **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The stoichiometry in the problem is 1:8, while the reaction requires a 1:3 ratio. This is a significant discrepancy. In such puzzles, sometimes the numbers are incorrect or refer to something non-obvious. We will note this discrepancy but continue, as the chemical fit of the hydrolysis reaction is very strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4 (Formation of H):** D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1)\n    *   D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)\n    *   There are two common reactions that fit this pattern:\n        *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) (Phosgene, a solvent and reagent).\n        *   SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) (Sulfuryl chloride, a solvent and reagent).\n    *   So, D is either CO or SO₂.\n\n*   **Clue 2 (Formation of E):** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   We need to test both possibilities for D.\n    *   **Case 1: D = CO.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 CO → E. This reaction is not standard and is unlikely to produce a single, well-known hazardous product.\n    *   **Case 2: D = SO₂.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 SO₂ → E. I₂Cl₆ (or ICl₃) is a strong oxidizing agent. SO₂ is a reducing agent. However, the reaction 2ICl₃ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂ produces two products, not a single product E.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluation and Alternative Hypotheses**\n\nThe I₂/ICl₃ hypothesis, while fitting Clue 3 perfectly, runs into significant problems with stoichiometry and the reaction to form E. Let's consider another approach, starting from the possible answers for the symmetry of E.\n\n*   The option **D4h** corresponds to a square planar geometry. The most famous example of a simple, neutral, extremely hazardous molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n*   Let's assume **E = XeF₄**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2 D(g) → XeF₄. The most direct synthesis is Xe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → XeF₄(s). This would imply **C = Xe** and **D = F₂**.\n    *   **Let's test this:**\n        *   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(Xe). This reaction to produce Xenon from a solid A is highly exotic (nuclear or decomposition of a complex compound). Also, C is described as a \"bright red product,\" whereas Xenon is a colorless gas. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   **Clue 3:** C(Xe) + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong) + G(weak). Xenon does not react with water to produce acids and a solid. This is a fatal flaw in the hypothesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion Path**\n\nBoth of the most promising chemical pathways lead to contradictions, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. This suggests either the problem statement is flawed, or it relies on very obscure chemistry. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3) has a near-perfect chemical match with the iodine chloride system. The issues with this path are stoichiometry and the final reaction to make E.\n*   The final product properties (hazardous, D4h symmetry) have a near-perfect match with XeF₄. The issues with this path are the formation and reaction properties of C.\n\nIn such puzzles, the question being asked is often the most reliable clue. The question is about the **molecular symmetry of E**. The D4h option points strongly to XeF₄. It is plausible that the puzzle was constructed around this specific molecule, and the other clues were created to be challenging, even to the point of being slightly inconsistent. Given that XeF₄ is the canonical example of a hazardous D4h molecule, it is the most probable intended identity for E.\n\nTherefore, assuming E is XeF₄, its molecular symmetry group is D4h.\n\nFinal check of the geometry of XeF₄:\n*   Xenon is the central atom.\n*   It has 4 bonding pairs (to F) and 2 lone pairs.\n*   VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral arrangement of electron pairs.\n*   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement in the equatorial plane.\n*   This geometry belongs to the D4h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 4**\n*   **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A very common reaction between two gases that forms a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n*   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) -> COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n*   Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 3**\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n*   If B is Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   HCl is a strong acid, so we can identify **F = HCl**.\n*   The reaction also regenerates the solid starting material A and produces a weak acid G. This suggests that the hydrolysis is a disproportionation reaction, where the central element in C is both reduced (back to A) and oxidized (to form the weak oxyacid G).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (gas) -> C (bright red product).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we have: A (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) -> C (bright red).\n*   The 1:8 molar ratio is a very strong clue. Let's consider elements that exist as stable polyatomic molecules in their solid state. Sulfur is a prime candidate, with its most stable allotrope being rhombic sulfur, S₈.\n*   Let's test the reaction with **A = S₈**.\n*   S₈ (s) + 8 Cl₂ (g) -> 8 SCl₂\n*   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and fits the \"1 to 8 equivalents\" description perfectly.\n*   Now let's check the product C. **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities with Reaction 3 again**\n*   Let's check if the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂ matches the products.\n*   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is complex but is known to disproportionate. A representative equation is:\n    3 SCl₂ + 4 H₂O -> 2 S + H₂SO₃ + 6 HCl\n*   Let's check the products against our deductions:\n    *   **A = S** (elemental sulfur), which is a solid. This matches the regeneration of A (S₈ is just the allotrope).\n    *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), a strong acid. This matches.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid. This matches.\n*   All compounds identified so far (A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=CO, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=COCl₂) are consistent with the first three reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify E**\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product).\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: SCl₂ + 2 CO -> E.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two products: phosgene (COCl₂) and carbonyl sulfide (SCO).\n    SCl₂ + 2 CO -> COCl₂ + SCO\n*   The problem states this reaction produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\" and asks for its molecular symmetry group, implying E is a single molecular species. Phosgene (COCl₂) is well-known for being an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is toxic, but phosgene better fits the description. Furthermore, we need to find the symmetry group of E from the given options.\n*   Let's assume **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   Molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Its structure is trigonal planar, with the carbon atom at the center, double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    2.  A vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n    3.  A second vertical mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first plane and also contains the C₂ axis (bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with an identity element (E), one C₂ axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check on the other product: Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is a linear molecule (O=C=S). It has a C∞ axis but no center of inversion or horizontal mirror plane, so its point group is C∞v, which is not among the options. This reinforces the conclusion that E is phosgene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core chemical reactions.**\n    The problem describes a series of reactions involving unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n    *   (1) A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red)\n    *   (2) C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   (3) C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   (4) D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n\n2.  **Identify B, D, and H.**\n    Reaction (4) is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common example of such a reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid and is used as a solvent in chemistry. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's assume: **B = SO₂** (sulfur dioxide), **D = Cl₂** (chlorine), and **H = SO₂Cl₂** (sulfuryl chloride).\n\n3.  **Identify G.**\n    Reaction (3) involves the hydrolysis of C to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Since C is formed from A and B (SO₂), it's highly likely that the hydrolysis of the SO₂ part of the molecule C yields the weak acid.\n    SO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid)\n    Sulfurous acid is a weak acid.\n    *   So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation and hydrolysis of C.**\n    *   Reaction (3) states that C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, along with acids F and G. This suggests that C is a complex or adduct containing A and B (SO₂).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid F, which is different from G, implies that A is likely a salt, probably a halide, such that its corresponding hydrohalic acid (a strong acid) is formed. For example, if A is an iodide salt (like KI), F could be HI (hydroiodic acid).\n\n5.  **Identify E.**\n    The main question is about the molecular symmetry of E. Let's focus on Reaction (2):\n    C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    Substituting our identified species D = Cl₂:\n    C + 2 Cl₂ -> E\n    The stoichiometry, requiring exactly **2 equivalents** of Cl₂, is a major clue. Let's consider what kind of reaction this could be. A reaction of an iodide salt with excess chlorine proceeds in two steps:\n    Step 1: 2 MI + Cl₂ -> 2 MCl + I₂\n    Step 2: I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2 ICl\n    Overall: MI + Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl (This uses 1 equivalent of Cl₂)\n    However, if more chlorine is used:\n    ICl + Cl₂ -> ICl₃\n    Combining these, the overall reaction from an iodide salt is:\n    **MI + 2 Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl₃**\n    This reaction consumes exactly 2 equivalents of Cl₂ per equivalent of the iodide salt MI. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry of Reaction (2).\n    *   This strongly suggests that **E = ICl₃** (iodine trichloride).\n    *   ICl₃ is a powerful oxidizing agent and is indeed an \"extremely hazardous\" substance.\n    *   This implies that C, whatever its complex structure is, acts as a source of iodide for this reaction. This is consistent with A being an iodide salt (e.g., KI).\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (ICl₃).**\n    *   To find the point group of ICl₃, we use VSEPR theory.\n    *   The central atom is Iodine (I).\n    *   Valence electrons of I = 7.\n    *   Electrons from 3 Cl atoms = 3 × 1 = 3.\n    *   Total valence electrons = 7 + 3 = 10.\n    *   This corresponds to 5 electron pairs around the central iodine atom.\n    *   The electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   There are 3 bonding pairs (I-Cl bonds) and 2 lone pairs.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three chlorine atoms occupy the two axial positions and the remaining equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n    *   A T-shaped molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and two vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The point group for this symmetry is **C₂v**.\n\n7.  **Final Check.**\n    Our deduction leads to E = ICl₃, which has C₂v symmetry. This is option D. The other clues, while not perfectly reconcilable without resorting to obscure chemistry (the \"bright red\" color and the \"8 equivalents\" for C are likely distractors or refer to a very specific, non-standard system), the deduction based on the clear stoichiometry of Reaction (2) provides a solid path to the answer.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ICl₃) is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given chemical reactions and clues.**\n\nWe are given four reactions and several descriptive clues:\n1.  **Solid A + 8 equivalents Gas B → Bright red product C**\n2.  **C + 2 equivalents Gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n3.  **C + H₂O → A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)**\n4.  **D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the simpler reactants and products first.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4 (D + B → H)** is a good starting point. It's a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n    CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    Phosgene (COCl₂) is a known solvent and was used as a chemical weapon. Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n*   **Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis of C)** provides strong clues. The products are the regenerated solid A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.\n    *   If B is Cl₂, then the strong acid F formed during hydrolysis is very likely **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis also produces a weak acid G. The reaction is: C + H₂O → A + HCl + G.\n    *   The regeneration of A is a crucial clue. It suggests that A is a stable component of C that is released upon reaction. The most chemically sound explanation for the formation of both a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid from the hydrolysis of a chloride-containing compound (C) is the disproportionation of chlorine itself in water:\n        Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid)\n    *   This implies that the hydrolysis of C releases Cl₂ molecules, which then react with water.\n    *   So, we can identify: **F = HCl** and **G = HClO**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify compound C based on its formation and hydrolysis.**\n\n*   For the hydrolysis of C to release Cl₂ and regenerate A, C must be an adduct or a complex salt where A is a stable core and Cl₂ molecules (or a polyhalide equivalent) are attached.\n*   Let's look at **Reaction 1**: A(s) + 8B(g) → C(red).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we get: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red).\n*   This 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly matches the idea that C is an adduct of A with 8 molecules of chlorine, i.e., **C = A·(Cl₂)₈**. Alternatively, if A is a salt like [Cation]Cl, then C could be a polychloride salt [Cation]⁺[Cl₁₇]⁻. In either case, C acts as a carrier for 8 Cl₂ molecules per unit of A.\n*   The hydrolysis reaction would then be: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 8H₂O → A(s) + 8HCl + 8HClO. This perfectly matches the products A, F, and G.\n*   The problem states C is a \"bright red product\". While simple chlorine adducts are not typically red, large polychloride or polyhalide ions can be brightly colored. We will assume this description holds for our proposed compound C.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the hazardous product E.**\n\n*   Now we analyze **Reaction 2**: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous).\n*   Substituting our identified C and D: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO → E.\n*   The reactive part of C is the stored chlorine molecules. Carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with chlorine (Cl₂) to form phosgene (COCl₂).\n    Cl₂ + CO → COCl₂\n*   The problem states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (CO). This is the most difficult clue to reconcile perfectly. Many chemical riddles contain slight inaccuracies or simplifications. If we assume that the reaction produces phosgene, the stoichiometry might be simplified in the problem statement. The most plausible hazardous product formed from a chlorine carrier (C) and carbon monoxide (D) is phosgene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n*   Phosgene is notoriously hazardous, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous product\". It was used as a chemical warfare agent in WWI.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   We have identified E as phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   To find its molecular symmetry group, we need to analyze its 3D structure.\n*   The phosgene molecule is planar, with a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  **Identity (E)**: All molecules have this.\n    2.  **C₂ axis**: There is a two-fold rotational axis passing through the C=O double bond. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    3.  **Mirror plane (σᵥ)**: There is a mirror plane that contains all three atoms (C, O, Cl, Cl), i.e., the plane of the molecule.\n    4.  **Mirror plane (σᵥ')**: There is a second mirror plane, perpendicular to the first one, that contains the C₂ axis (i.e., it contains the C and O atoms and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with the symmetry elements E, C₂, σᵥ, and σᵥ' belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step deduction, the hazardous product E is phosgene (COCl₂). The molecular symmetry group for phosgene is C₂ᵥ. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a step-by-step deduction that reconciles the chemical clues, even with known inconsistencies in this classic riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify A, B, C, F, G:** The most specific clue is the hydrolysis reaction (C + H₂O → A + F + G). This points to a disproportionation. The reaction involving iodine chlorides fits best:\n    *   **A**: I₂ (Iodine, a solid)\n    *   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine, a gas)\n    *   **C**: I₂Cl₆ (Iodine trichloride dimer, which is bright yellow, not red—a known flaw in the riddle)\n    *   **F**: HCl (a strong acid)\n    *   **G**: HIO₃ (Iodic acid, a weak acid)\n\n2.  **Identify D and H:** The reaction of two gases (D + B) in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) points to the synthesis of phosgene.\n    *   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n3.  **Identify E:** The reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D produces the \"extremely hazardous\" product E.\n    *   Reaction: I₂Cl₆ + 2CO → 2ICl + 2COCl₂\n    *   The extremely hazardous product, **E**, is **COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (COCl₂):**\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that runs along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two σv planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio\n\n2.  **Identify the Substances:** This chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying the components. The synthesis of mustard gas provides a consistent fit for all the described reactions.\n\n    *   **Identify D, B, and H:** Let's test the hypothesis that this series of reactions describes the synthesis of mustard gas. The synthesis of the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (H) from ethene (D) and chlorine (B) is a well-known industrial process.\n        *   **D = Ethene (C₂H₄)**, a gas.\n        *   **B = Chlorine (Cl₂)**, a gas.\n        *   **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n        *   Reaction 4: C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction, fitting the description.\n\n    *   **Identify A and C:** Now using B = Cl₂, let's look at Reaction 1.\n        *   A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red product).\n        *   The 1:8 stoichiometry is a major clue. Sulfur exists as a crown-shaped S₈ molecule, which is a solid. The reaction of elemental sulfur with chlorine is:\n        *   S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly if we consider the molecular form of sulfur.\n        *   Therefore, **A = S₈** and **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid. The description of C as a solid might be a slight inaccuracy in the riddle, or it could refer to the substance at a lower temperature.\n\n    *   **Identify E:** Now we can deduce E from Reaction 2.\n        *   C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n        *   SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E.\n        *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n        *   SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S(l). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. So, **E = Mustard Gas**.\n\n    *   **Verify with Reaction 3:** Let's check the hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n        *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is complex, but it is known to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid. It also produces elemental sulfur.\n        *   2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n        *   This fits the products: **F = HCl** (strong acid), **G = H₂SO₃** (weak acid), and the regeneration of elemental sulfur (**A**).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E has been identified as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group, which typically refers to the point group of the molecule in its most stable conformation.\n    *   While the molecule can exist in many shapes, its lowest energy conformations lack high symmetry. The most stable conformers possess **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two ethyl chloride groups.\n    *   The molecule does not possess the vertical mirror planes required for C₂ᵥ symmetry, nor the higher symmetry of D₄h or D∞h groups.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the chemical clues provided, the identities of the substances can be deduced as follows:\n\n*   **A** is the solid element **Gold (Au)**.\n*   **B** is the gas **Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl)**.\n*   **C** is the bright red product **Nitrosonium tetrachloroaurate(III) (NO[AuCl₄])**. The reaction is Au + 4NOCl → NO[AuCl₄] + 3NO. The \"8 equivalents\" in the prompt is a known inaccuracy in this classic riddle.\n*   The hydrolysis of C (NO[AuCl₄]) in water yields elemental gold (A), a strong acid **F** (**Hydrochloric acid, HCl**), and a weak acid **G** (**Nitrous acid, HNO₂**).\n*   The reaction `C + 2D -> E` suggests that E is a product derived from the decomposition or reaction of C. The most fundamental component of C is gold(III) chloride.\n*   **E** is therefore identified as **Gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃)**. While gold compounds are toxic, the term \"extremely hazardous\" is likely an exaggeration for the puzzle's effect.\n*   The molecular structure of monomeric Gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃) is T-shaped, which belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle where several clues have apparent contradictions with common chemical knowledge. A step-by-step deduction, prioritizing the most unique chemical reactions, is necessary to identify the unknown substances.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The reaction `D + B -> H` in a 1:1 ratio, where H is a solvent, strongly suggests the formation of phosgene.\n    *   **B** is Chlorine gas (Cl₂).\n    *   **D** is Carbon Monoxide (CO).\n    *   **H** is Phosgene (COCl₂).\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:** The most chemically distinctive clue is the hydrolysis of C: `C + H₂O -> A + F + G`.\n    *   **F** is stated to be a strong acid. Since C is a chloride (formed from B=Cl₂), **F** is Hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    *   **G** is a weak acid containing the element A.\n    *   **A** is a solid element that is reformed during the hydrolysis. This indicates a disproportionation reaction, where the element in compound C is both reduced back to its elemental state (A) and oxidized to form a weak acid (G).\n    *   This specific type of disproportionation is characteristic of Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). When AuCl reacts with water, it disproportionates to form metallic gold (Au) and gold(III) hydroxide (Au(OH)₃, also known as auric acid), which is a weak acid, along with hydrochloric acid.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **A** = Gold (Au)\n        *   **C** = Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). AuCl is a yellow solid, which is a slight contradiction to the \"bright red\" description, possibly an inaccuracy in the puzzle.\n        *   **G** = Auric acid (Au(OH)₃).\n\n3.  **Address Contradictions:** The first reaction, `A (solid) + 8 equivalents of gas B -> C`, does not match the actual synthesis of AuCl from Au and Cl₂ (2Au + Cl₂ -> 2AuCl). This significant discrepancy in stoichiometry is likely an error or a \"red herring\" in the puzzle statement. Given the uniqueness of the hydrolysis reaction, we proceed with the identification of A and C as Au and AuCl.\n\n4.  **Identify E:** The final unknown, E, is formed from the reaction `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E`.\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `AuCl + 2 CO -> E`.\n    *   Gold(I) chloride is known to react with carbon monoxide. While the most common product is Au(CO)Cl (a 1:1 adduct), the formation of a dicarbonyl species, **Au(CO)₂Cl**, is plausible under certain conditions and fits the 2-equivalent stoichiometry given.\n    *   This compound, dicarbonylchlorogold(I), is unstable and, like many heavy metal carbonyls, can be considered hazardous.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The task is to find the molecular symmetry group of E = Au(CO)₂Cl.\n    *   As a Gold(I) complex, the central gold atom is three-coordinate. The most stable geometry for such a complex is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule has the structure of a central Au atom bonded to one Cl atom and two CO groups.\n    *   This arrangement results in a planar molecule with a twofold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the Au-Cl bond and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. Theoretical calculations confirm this geometry.\n\nFinal Answer is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the corrected step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of compound E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction clues to identify the compounds.**\n\n*   **Clue 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (1:1 ratio), H is a solvent. The reaction SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) is a perfect match. Sulfuryl chloride (H) is a solvent. This implies {B, D} = {Cl₂, SO₂}.\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). This is a hydrolysis reaction. If C is a chloride, its hydrolysis would produce HCl (a strong acid, F). This suggests B = Cl₂ and D = SO₂.\n*   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product). With B = Cl₂, the reaction is A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C. A well-known reaction involves iodine: I₂(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2ICl(s). Iodine monochloride (ICl) is a red-brown solid, fitting the \"bright red\" description. The 1:8 stoichiometry is likely a red herring, as the qualitative descriptions are chemically consistent.\n*   Let's verify this set of identities with Clue 3 again. If A = I₂ and C = ICl, the hydrolysis is: 5ICl + 3H₂O → 5HCl + HIO₃ + 2I₂. This reaction regenerates solid A (I₂), and produces a strong acid F (HCl) and a weak acid G (HIO₃). This is a perfect fit.\n*   **Summary of Identities:**\n    *   A = I₂ (Iodine)\n    *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   C = ICl (Iodine monochloride)\n    *   D = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide)\n    *   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   G = HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n    *   H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the identity and structure of E.**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n*   The reaction is: ICl + 2SO₂ → E.\n*   ICl acts as a Lewis acid and reacts with the Lewis base SO₂ to form the ionic salt [I(SO₂)₂]⁺Cl⁻. The product E is the cation [I(SO₂)₂]⁺. Such reactive species are known to be hazardous.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The species is the cation **E = [I(SO₂)₂]⁺**. We need to determine its geometry using VSEPR theory.\n*   The central atom is Iodine. Since the overall charge is +1, we consider the central atom to be I⁺.\n*   Iodine (Group 17) has 7 valence electrons. Therefore, I⁺ has 7 - 1 = 6 valence electrons.\n*   The two SO₂ molecules are the ligands (X), bonded to the central iodine atom (A).\n*   The number of lone pairs (E) on the central atom is calculated as: E = (Valence electrons on I⁺ - electrons used in bonding) / 2. Assuming single bonds to the two sulfur atoms, this is E = (6 - 2) / 2 = 2 lone pairs.\n*   The VSEPR notation for [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ is **AX₂E₂**.\n*   An AX₂E₂ species has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry, which results in a **bent** or **V-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   A bent molecule of the general formula Y-X-Y has the following symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotational axis passing through the central atom (I) and bisecting the Y-X-Y angle (S-I-S angle).\n    2.  Two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that both contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the S-I-S atoms, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n*   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E, the [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ cation, is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio. A plausible reaction that fits this description is the synthesis of 1,2-dichloroethane, a solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄ (ethene) + Cl₂ (chlorine) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (ethene gas)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane solvent)\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (Cl₂) → C (bright red product).\n    *   We are looking for a solid A that reacts with a large amount of chlorine to form a red product C. Let's consider elemental sulfur.\n    *   **A = S₈** (elemental sulfur is a solid).\n    *   The reaction S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂ uses 1 mole of S₈ and 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the 1:8 stoichiometry if we consider one mole of the S₈ ring.\n    *   The product is **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride), which is a cherry-red liquid. We'll assume the puzzle allows for a liquid product described as \"bright red product C\".\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** C (SCl₂) + H₂O → A (S₈) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides is complex but is known to produce elemental sulfur, hydrochloric acid, and sulfur dioxide.\n    *   SCl₂ reacts with water, ultimately producing:\n        *   Elemental sulfur, which is solid **A (S₈)**, thus reforming the starting material.\n        *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n        *   SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), which dissolves in water to form **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** C (SCl₂) + 2 equivalents of D (C₂H₄) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of mustard gas.\n    *   **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or mustard gas). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   To determine its point group, we must consider its three-dimensional shape. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We consider its most stable, highest-symmetry conformation.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. It is not planar.\n    *   The only symmetry element present in the stable conformation of the molecule is a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule that only possesses an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C2** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (mustard gas) is C2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the chemical clues provided, the compounds were identified as follows: A is Iodine (I₂), B is Chlorine (Cl₂), C is Iodine monochloride (ICl), D is Carbon monoxide (CO), H is Phosgene (COCl₂), F is Hydrochloric acid (HCl), and G is Iodic acid (HIO₃).\n\nThe extremely hazardous product E is formed from the reaction of C (ICl) with two equivalents of D (CO), resulting in the dicarbonyliodine(I) cation, [I(CO)₂]⁺.\n\nUsing VSEPR theory to determine the geometry of this cation, the central Iodine(I) ion has 6 valence electrons. It forms two bonds with the carbon monoxide ligands and has two lone pairs of electrons. This AX₂E₂ configuration results in a bent molecular geometry, similar to water. A bent molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes, which corresponds to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis chemical riddle describes a series of reactions to ultimately identify the molecular symmetry of product E. A step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues leads to the identification of all compounds involved.\n\n*   **Identifying the reactants and products:**\n    *   The reaction where gas D and gas B react in a 1:1 ratio to form solvent H strongly suggests a reaction like **Cl₂ (D) + SO₂ (B) → SO₂Cl₂ (H)**. Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a known solvent. However, this path does not align well with the other clues, particularly the hydrolysis step.\n    *   A more fitting interpretation, despite some inconsistencies often found in such riddles, revolves around noble gas chemistry. Let's assume **E is Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**. It is known to be hazardous and is a classic example of a molecule with D₄h symmetry.\n    *   The formation of E (XeF₄) is from C + 2D. The standard synthesis of XeF₄ is **Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄**. This implies that **C is Xenon (Xe)** and **D is Fluorine (F₂)**.\n    *   The description of C as a \"bright red product\" is a known inconsistency in this classic riddle; Xenon is a colorless gas.\n    *   With D identified as F₂, we can look at the reaction D + B → H (solvent). So, F₂ + B → H. A plausible reaction is with bromine to form bromine trifluoride (BrF₃), which can be used as a fluorinating solvent. So, **B could be Br₂** and **H could be BrF₃**.\n    *   The first reaction is A (solid) + 8B (gas) → C (red product). This would be A + 8Br₂ → Xe. This step does not correspond to a known chemical reaction and highlights a flaw in the riddle's construction.\n    *   The third reaction is C + H₂O → A + F + G. This would be Xe + H₂O → A + F + G. Xenon does not react with water under normal conditions, but its fluorides do. For instance, the hydrolysis of XeF₆ produces XeO₃ and HF. This indicates the riddle is not perfectly self-consistent.\n\n*   **Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    Despite the inconsistencies in the narrative clues, the question asks for the molecular symmetry of product E. By identifying E as the well-known and hazardous compound XeF₄, we can determine its structure.\n    *   **E = Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, the central Xenon atom has four bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the axial positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement around the central xenon atom.\n    *   A square planar molecule belongs to the **D₄h point group**. This point group is characterized by a principal C₄ axis, perpendicular C₂ axes, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and vertical and dihedral mirror planes.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (XeF₄) is D₄h.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step debate to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n### Self-Debate\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nMy initial approach is to decode the chemical identities of the substances starting with the most concrete clues.\n\n1.  **Clue 3 & 4 Analysis:**\n    *   Clue 4 states that two gases, B and D, react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, H. A common reaction that fits this is 2NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄. Here, gas B and gas D are both NO₂, and the solvent H is dinitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄), which is a liquid solvent.\n    *   Clue 3 states that C reacts with water to form A, a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). If we test our hypothesis that B is NO₂, the hydrolysis of NO₂ in water produces both nitric acid (HNO₃, a strong acid) and nitrous acid (HNO₂, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description of F and G.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis:**\n    *   **B** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **D** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **H** = N₂O₄ (Dinitrogen tetroxide)\n    *   **F** = HNO₃ (Nitric acid)\n    *   **G** = HNO₂ (Nitrous acid)\n\n3.  **Proposed Action:**\n    Based on this strong evidence, I will proceed assuming these identities are correct and attempt to identify the hazardous product E. The remaining clues describe the formation of E:\n    *   A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   C + 2NO₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n\nThis means E is the result of a reaction between solid A and a total of 10 equivalents of NO₂. E must be a nitrogen-containing compound. A plausible, hazardous nitrogen oxide that can be formed is dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅). I will now search for the molecular symmetry of N₂O₅.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nThe Proposer's case hinges on the identification of B and D as NO₂. While this is a strong inference, the subsequent leap to identifying E as N₂O₅ is based on plausibility rather than direct evidence from the clues. The core weakness is the unknown reaction pathway: A(s) + 10NO₂(g) → E. Without knowing what A and C are, we cannot be certain that E is N₂O₅. The puzzle could have a different solution if our initial deduction about B and D is a clever misdirection.\n\nHowever, the search results confirm that gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅) is a known hazardous compound. More importantly, multiple sources state that its equilibrium structure in the gas phase has **C2 symmetry**. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nThe Skeptic's point is valid; the chain of deduction has a weak link regarding the specific reaction. However, in the context of a well-posed puzzle, the elegance with which B=D=NO₂ solves two major, independent clues (the specific acid products and the solvent formation) is too powerful to ignore. The puzzle is likely designed around this central deduction. The subsequent steps (A→C→E) may involve obscure chemistry intended to be opaque, forcing the solver to identify the most logical hazardous product, E, based on the established reactants. N₂O₅ is a hazardous nitrogen oxide, and its gaseous C2 symmetry is a perfect fit for the options.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe debate converges. The evidence strongly supports the identification of B and D as NO₂. The most logical hazardous product, E, that could be formed and matches a symmetry option is N₂O₅. The molecular symmetry group for gaseous N₂O₅ is C2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Two of them stand out as being highly consistent with the clues.\n\n*   **Pathway A: The Sulfur/Mustard Gas Path (Leads to C₂ symmetry)**\n    *   This pathway is detailed in answers 8 and 13.\n    *   **Identities:** A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=C₂H₄, E=Mustard Gas, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=C₂H₄Cl₂.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway is exceptionally strong.\n        *   **Reaction 1 (1:8):** S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l). This perfectly matches the 1:8 stoichiometry and the description of C as a red product (SCl₂ is cherry-red).\n        *   **Reaction 4 (1:1):** C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a standard reaction forming a solvent.\n        *   **Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis):** The hydrolysis of SCl₂ produces elemental sulfur (A), HCl (F, strong acid), and H₂SO₃ (G, weak acid). This is a perfect fit.\n        *   **Reaction 2 (1:2):** SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S. This is the Levinstein process, a famous synthesis of mustard gas (E) that perfectly matches the stoichiometry and \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway provides a consistent and chemically sound explanation for every single clue. The resulting molecule E, mustard gas, has **C₂** symmetry.\n\n*   **Pathway B: The Sulfur/Phosgene (or Thiophosgene) Path (Leads to C₂ᵥ symmetry)**\n    *   This pathway is detailed in answers 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   **Identities:** A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=CO, E=COCl₂ or CSCl₂, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=COCl₂.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway is also very strong.\n        *   It correctly identifies A, B, C, F, and G using the same logic as Pathway A, perfectly matching the 1:8 stoichiometry and hydrolysis clues.\n        *   **Reaction 4 (1:1):** CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l). This is a standard reaction forming a solvent/reagent.\n        *   **Reaction 2 (1:2):** SCl₂ + 2CO → E. This is the only slightly ambiguous step. However, a balanced reaction like SCl₂ + 2CO → CSCl₂ + CO₂ is plausible. This would identify E as thiophosgene (CSCl₂), which is extremely hazardous.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is also highly consistent. The resulting molecule E, thiophosgene (CSCl₂) or phosgene (COCl₂), has **C₂ᵥ** symmetry.\n\n**3. Comparison and Final Decision**\n\nWe have two excellent but mutually exclusive solutions leading to different symmetry groups.\n*   Pathway A leads to E = Mustard Gas, which has **C₂** symmetry.\n*   Pathway B leads to E = Thiophosgene/Phosgene, which has **C₂ᵥ** symmetry.\n\nWhile Pathway A is arguably more elegant because the final reaction step (Levinstein process) is a more famous and direct synthesis than the one in Pathway B, the consensus among the provided answers leans heavily towards C₂ᵥ.\n\n*   **Reasoning for C₂ᵥ:** Answers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 14 all present reasoning that leads to a molecule with C₂ᵥ symmetry. This includes the strong Sulfur/Phosgene path and the Iodine/Phosgene path.\n*   **Reasoning for C₂:** Only answers 8, 13, and 16 present reasoning that leads to C₂ symmetry.\n\nThe sheer number of independent lines of reasoning that converge on C₂ᵥ suggests it is the intended answer. The Sulfur/Phosgene path (Pathway B) is the most robust of these, as it correctly accounts for the critical 1:8 stoichiometry clue. Therefore, we conclude that E is phosgene or thiophosgene, and its symmetry group is C₂ᵥ.\n\nThe options are:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) C2\nD) D∞h\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

While the problem states 8 equivalents of gas B, the other reactions strongly support this chemical scheme. The stoichiometry in the riddle is likely a red herring or an error. I₂Cl₆ is a bright yellow solid that can appear reddish upon exposure to light.\n*   **Reaction 2**: I₂Cl₆(s) + 2CO(g) → 2COCl₂(g) + I₂(s). This reaction produces product E, phosgene (COCl₂), which is known to be extremely hazardous.\n*   **Reaction 3**: The hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (the monomer of C) produces iodine, hydrochloric acid, and iodic acid (5ICl₃ + 9H₂O → 15HCl + I₂ + 3HIO₃). This matches the description of reforming solid A (I₂) and producing a strong acid F (HCl) and a weaker acid G (HIO₃).\n*   **Reaction 4**: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g). This 1:1 reaction between gas D (CO) and gas B (Cl₂) forms phosgene (H), which is used as a solvent and reagent in industrial chemistry.\n\nThe extremely hazardous product E is identified as phosgene (COCl₂). To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must look at its structure. Phosgene has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms, resulting in a trigonal planar molecular geometry.\n\nThe symmetry elements of the COCl₂ molecule are:\n*   A C₂ rotational axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n*   Two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n\nA molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and solve the puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:**\n    *   Clue 4 states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\" Both B and D are gases.\n    *   A well-known reaction between two common gases that forms a liquid solvent is the synthesis of phosgene:\n        CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid (boiling point 8 °C) and can be used as a solvent in organic chemistry.\n    *   This allows us to tentatively identify H as phosgene (COCl₂), and the pair {B, D} as {CO, Cl₂}.\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:**\n    *   We have two possibilities for B and D. Let's test them.\n    *   **Case 1: B = CO and D = Cl₂.**\n        *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8CO(g) → C(red). C would be a metal carbonyl.\n        *   Clue 2: C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls does not typically produce two different acids. This case is unlikely.\n    *   **Case 2: B = Cl₂ and D = CO.**\n        *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red).\n        *   Let's consider what solid A could be. Sulfur exists as a solid, S₈. The reaction of sulfur with chlorine is:\n            S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry if we interpret \"product C\" as the substance SCl₂, even though 8 moles are formed. Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a cherry-red liquid. This is a very good match for C.\n        *   So, let's assume: **A = S₈**, **B = Cl₂**, and **C = SCl₂**.\n        *   Clue 2: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.\n        *   Let's check the hydrolysis of SCl₂:\n            2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S(s)\n        *   This reaction reforms elemental sulfur (A). It produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid (F). It also produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (G).\n        *   This fits perfectly. **F = HCl** and **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n3.  **Identify E:**\n    *   We have identified:\n        *   C = SCl₂ (sulfur dichloride)\n        *   D = CO (carbon monoxide)\n    *   Clue 3 states: \"C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2CO → E\n    *   Let's consider a plausible reaction. A balanced chemical equation is:\n        SCl₂ + 2CO → CSCl₂ + CO₂\n    *   This reaction produces thiophosgene (CSCl₂) and carbon dioxide. Thiophosgene is an extremely hazardous and toxic substance, fitting the description of E.\n    *   Therefore, **E = CSCl₂** (thiophosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the point group of E = CSCl₂.\n    *   Thiophosgene has a planar trigonal structure, similar to phosgene. The carbon atom is central, double-bonded to the sulfur atom and single-bonded to the two chlorine atoms.\n        ```\n           Cl\n            \\\n             C = S\n            /\n           Cl\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has the following symmetry elements:\n        *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=S bond.\n        *   A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n        *   A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (CSCl₂) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for several unknown substances (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H).\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(acid, strong) + G(acid, weak)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n5.  **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D∞h, B) C2, C) D4h, D) C2v.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Most Constraining Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 (Hydrolysis of C):** This is the most chemically specific clue. The reaction of C with water regenerates the solid starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The fact that A is reformed suggests that A is an element (likely a metal or metalloid) that is part of a complex or unstable compound C, and is released in its elemental form upon hydrolysis.\n    *   The formation of two different acids implies that the part of C that is not A (which comes from gas B) must contain at least two different non-metal elements that form acids upon hydrolysis.\n\n*   **A Plausible Chemical System for Clue 3:** A well-known reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (ICl₃).\n    *   5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → I₂(s) + 15 HCl(aq) + 3 HIO₃(aq)\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   **A = I₂** (Iodine is a solid at standard conditions). A is reformed.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid).\n        *   **G = HIO₃** (Iodic acid is a weaker acid than HCl).\n    *   This system perfectly matches the description in Clue 3. Let's tentatively identify these substances.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nIf A = I₂, F = HCl, and G = HIO₃, then C must be an iodine chloride. The formula for iodine trichloride is ICl₃, which exists as a dimer, **I₂Cl₆**, a bright yellow solid. We will assume \"bright red\" is a slight inaccuracy or refers to a similar compound, and proceed with C = I₂Cl₆.\n\n*   **Clue 1 (Formation of C):** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C\n    *   I₂(s) + B(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)\n    *   The balanced reaction is I₂(s) + 3 Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s).\n    *   This implies that **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The stoichiometry in the problem is 1:8, while the reaction requires a 1:3 ratio. This is a significant discrepancy. In such puzzles, sometimes the numbers are incorrect or refer to something non-obvious. We will note this discrepancy but continue, as the chemical fit of the hydrolysis reaction is very strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4 (Formation of H):** D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1)\n    *   D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)\n    *   There are two common reactions that fit this pattern:\n        *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) (Phosgene, a solvent and reagent).\n        *   SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) (Sulfuryl chloride, a solvent and reagent).\n    *   So, D is either CO or SO₂.\n\n*   **Clue 2 (Formation of E):** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   We need to test both possibilities for D.\n    *   **Case 1: D = CO.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 CO → E. This reaction is not standard and is unlikely to produce a single, well-known hazardous product.\n    *   **Case 2: D = SO₂.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 SO₂ → E. I₂Cl₆ (or ICl₃) is a strong oxidizing agent. SO₂ is a reducing agent. However, the reaction 2ICl₃ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂ produces two products, not a single product E.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluation and Alternative Hypotheses**\n\nThe I₂/ICl₃ hypothesis, while fitting Clue 3 perfectly, runs into significant problems with stoichiometry and the reaction to form E. Let's consider another approach, starting from the possible answers for the symmetry of E.\n\n*   The option **D4h** corresponds to a square planar geometry. The most famous example of a simple, neutral, extremely hazardous molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n*   Let's assume **E = XeF₄**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2 D(g) → XeF₄. The most direct synthesis is Xe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → XeF₄(s). This would imply **C = Xe** and **D = F₂**.\n    *   **Let's test this:**\n        *   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(Xe). This reaction to produce Xenon from a solid A is highly exotic (nuclear or decomposition of a complex compound). Also, C is described as a \"bright red product,\" whereas Xenon is a colorless gas. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   **Clue 3:** C(Xe) + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong) + G(weak). Xenon does not react with water to produce acids and a solid. This is a fatal flaw in the hypothesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion Path**\n\nBoth of the most promising chemical pathways lead to contradictions, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. This suggests either the problem statement is flawed, or it relies on very obscure chemistry. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3) has a near-perfect chemical match with the iodine chloride system. The issues with this path are stoichiometry and the final reaction to make E.\n*   The final product properties (hazardous, D4h symmetry) have a near-perfect match with XeF₄. The issues with this path are the formation and reaction properties of C.\n\nIn such puzzles, the question being asked is often the most reliable clue. The question is about the **molecular symmetry of E**. The D4h option points strongly to XeF₄. It is plausible that the puzzle was constructed around this specific molecule, and the other clues were created to be challenging, even to the point of being slightly inconsistent. Given that XeF₄ is the canonical example of a hazardous D4h molecule, it is the most probable intended identity for E.\n\nTherefore, assuming E is XeF₄, its molecular symmetry group is D4h.\n\nFinal check of the geometry of XeF₄:\n*   Xenon is the central atom.\n*   It has 4 bonding pairs (to F) and 2 lone pairs.\n*   VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral arrangement of electron pairs.\n*   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement in the equatorial plane.\n*   This geometry belongs to the D4h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 4**\n*   **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   A very common reaction between two gases that forms a liquid solvent is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas.\n*   CO (gas) + Cl₂ (gas) -> COCl₂ (liquid, phosgene)\n*   Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (phosgene)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 3**\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n*   If B is Cl₂, then C must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   HCl is a strong acid, so we can identify **F = HCl**.\n*   The reaction also regenerates the solid starting material A and produces a weak acid G. This suggests that the hydrolysis is a disproportionation reaction, where the central element in C is both reduced (back to A) and oxidized (to form the weak oxyacid G).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (gas) -> C (bright red product).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we have: A (solid) + 8 Cl₂ (gas) -> C (bright red).\n*   The 1:8 molar ratio is a very strong clue. Let's consider elements that exist as stable polyatomic molecules in their solid state. Sulfur is a prime candidate, with its most stable allotrope being rhombic sulfur, S₈.\n*   Let's test the reaction with **A = S₈**.\n*   S₈ (s) + 8 Cl₂ (g) -> 8 SCl₂\n*   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and fits the \"1 to 8 equivalents\" description perfectly.\n*   Now let's check the product C. **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid, which matches the \"bright red product C\".\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities with Reaction 3 again**\n*   Let's check if the hydrolysis of C = SCl₂ matches the products.\n*   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is complex but is known to disproportionate. A representative equation is:\n    3 SCl₂ + 4 H₂O -> 2 S + H₂SO₃ + 6 HCl\n*   Let's check the products against our deductions:\n    *   **A = S** (elemental sulfur), which is a solid. This matches the regeneration of A (S₈ is just the allotrope).\n    *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), a strong acid. This matches.\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid. This matches.\n*   All compounds identified so far (A=S₈, B=Cl₂, C=SCl₂, D=CO, F=HCl, G=H₂SO₃, H=COCl₂) are consistent with the first three reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify E**\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous product).\n*   Substituting our identified compounds: SCl₂ + 2 CO -> E.\n*   This reaction is known to produce two products: phosgene (COCl₂) and carbonyl sulfide (SCO).\n    SCl₂ + 2 CO -> COCl₂ + SCO\n*   The problem states this reaction produces \"the extremely hazardous product E\" and asks for its molecular symmetry group, implying E is a single molecular species. Phosgene (COCl₂) is well-known for being an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is toxic, but phosgene better fits the description. Furthermore, we need to find the symmetry group of E from the given options.\n*   Let's assume **E = COCl₂** (phosgene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   Molecule E is phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   Its structure is trigonal planar, with the carbon atom at the center, double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    2.  A vertical mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the plane of the molecule).\n    3.  A second vertical mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the first plane and also contains the C₂ axis (bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with an identity element (E), one C₂ axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nFinal check on the other product: Carbonyl sulfide (SCO) is a linear molecule (O=C=S). It has a C∞ axis but no center of inversion or horizontal mirror plane, so its point group is C∞v, which is not among the options. This reinforces the conclusion that E is phosgene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core chemical reactions.**\n    The problem describes a series of reactions involving unknown substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n    *   (1) A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red)\n    *   (2) C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   (3) C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   (4) D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent) [1:1 ratio]\n\n2.  **Identify B, D, and H.**\n    Reaction (4) is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common example of such a reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n    SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) -> SO₂Cl₂(l)\n    Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid and is used as a solvent in chemistry. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's assume: **B = SO₂** (sulfur dioxide), **D = Cl₂** (chlorine), and **H = SO₂Cl₂** (sulfuryl chloride).\n\n3.  **Identify G.**\n    Reaction (3) involves the hydrolysis of C to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Since C is formed from A and B (SO₂), it's highly likely that the hydrolysis of the SO₂ part of the molecule C yields the weak acid.\n    SO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid)\n    Sulfurous acid is a weak acid.\n    *   So, **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the formation and hydrolysis of C.**\n    *   Reaction (3) states that C hydrolyzes to regenerate A, along with acids F and G. This suggests that C is a complex or adduct containing A and B (SO₂).\n    *   The formation of a strong acid F, which is different from G, implies that A is likely a salt, probably a halide, such that its corresponding hydrohalic acid (a strong acid) is formed. For example, if A is an iodide salt (like KI), F could be HI (hydroiodic acid).\n\n5.  **Identify E.**\n    The main question is about the molecular symmetry of E. Let's focus on Reaction (2):\n    C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)\n    Substituting our identified species D = Cl₂:\n    C + 2 Cl₂ -> E\n    The stoichiometry, requiring exactly **2 equivalents** of Cl₂, is a major clue. Let's consider what kind of reaction this could be. A reaction of an iodide salt with excess chlorine proceeds in two steps:\n    Step 1: 2 MI + Cl₂ -> 2 MCl + I₂\n    Step 2: I₂ + Cl₂ -> 2 ICl\n    Overall: MI + Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl (This uses 1 equivalent of Cl₂)\n    However, if more chlorine is used:\n    ICl + Cl₂ -> ICl₃\n    Combining these, the overall reaction from an iodide salt is:\n    **MI + 2 Cl₂ -> MCl + ICl₃**\n    This reaction consumes exactly 2 equivalents of Cl₂ per equivalent of the iodide salt MI. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry of Reaction (2).\n    *   This strongly suggests that **E = ICl₃** (iodine trichloride).\n    *   ICl₃ is a powerful oxidizing agent and is indeed an \"extremely hazardous\" substance.\n    *   This implies that C, whatever its complex structure is, acts as a source of iodide for this reaction. This is consistent with A being an iodide salt (e.g., KI).\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (ICl₃).**\n    *   To find the point group of ICl₃, we use VSEPR theory.\n    *   The central atom is Iodine (I).\n    *   Valence electrons of I = 7.\n    *   Electrons from 3 Cl atoms = 3 × 1 = 3.\n    *   Total valence electrons = 7 + 3 = 10.\n    *   This corresponds to 5 electron pairs around the central iodine atom.\n    *   The electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   There are 3 bonding pairs (I-Cl bonds) and 2 lone pairs.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions. The three chlorine atoms occupy the two axial positions and the remaining equatorial position.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **T-shaped** molecular geometry.\n    *   A T-shaped molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation and two vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The point group for this symmetry is **C₂v**.\n\n7.  **Final Check.**\n    Our deduction leads to E = ICl₃, which has C₂v symmetry. This is option D. The other clues, while not perfectly reconcilable without resorting to obscure chemistry (the \"bright red\" color and the \"8 equivalents\" for C are likely distractors or refer to a very specific, non-standard system), the deduction based on the clear stoichiometry of Reaction (2) provides a solid path to the answer.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (ICl₃) is C₂v.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and ultimately determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given chemical reactions and clues.**\n\nWe are given four reactions and several descriptive clues:\n1.  **Solid A + 8 equivalents Gas B → Bright red product C**\n2.  **C + 2 equivalents Gas D → Extremely hazardous product E**\n3.  **C + H₂O → A + Acid F (strong) + Acid G (weak)**\n4.  **D + B (1:1 ratio) → H (solvent)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the simpler reactants and products first.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4 (D + B → H)** is a good starting point. It's a 1:1 reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a solvent (H). A very common reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n    CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    Phosgene (COCl₂) is a known solvent and was used as a chemical weapon. Let's hypothesize:\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n*   **Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis of C)** provides strong clues. The products are the regenerated solid A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.\n    *   If B is Cl₂, then the strong acid F formed during hydrolysis is very likely **HCl** (Hydrochloric acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis also produces a weak acid G. The reaction is: C + H₂O → A + HCl + G.\n    *   The regeneration of A is a crucial clue. It suggests that A is a stable component of C that is released upon reaction. The most chemically sound explanation for the formation of both a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid from the hydrolysis of a chloride-containing compound (C) is the disproportionation of chlorine itself in water:\n        Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid)\n    *   This implies that the hydrolysis of C releases Cl₂ molecules, which then react with water.\n    *   So, we can identify: **F = HCl** and **G = HClO**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify compound C based on its formation and hydrolysis.**\n\n*   For the hydrolysis of C to release Cl₂ and regenerate A, C must be an adduct or a complex salt where A is a stable core and Cl₂ molecules (or a polyhalide equivalent) are attached.\n*   Let's look at **Reaction 1**: A(s) + 8B(g) → C(red).\n*   Substituting B = Cl₂, we get: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red).\n*   This 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly matches the idea that C is an adduct of A with 8 molecules of chlorine, i.e., **C = A·(Cl₂)₈**. Alternatively, if A is a salt like [Cation]Cl, then C could be a polychloride salt [Cation]⁺[Cl₁₇]⁻. In either case, C acts as a carrier for 8 Cl₂ molecules per unit of A.\n*   The hydrolysis reaction would then be: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 8H₂O → A(s) + 8HCl + 8HClO. This perfectly matches the products A, F, and G.\n*   The problem states C is a \"bright red product\". While simple chlorine adducts are not typically red, large polychloride or polyhalide ions can be brightly colored. We will assume this description holds for our proposed compound C.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the hazardous product E.**\n\n*   Now we analyze **Reaction 2**: C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous).\n*   Substituting our identified C and D: A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO → E.\n*   The reactive part of C is the stored chlorine molecules. Carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with chlorine (Cl₂) to form phosgene (COCl₂).\n    Cl₂ + CO → COCl₂\n*   The problem states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (CO). This is the most difficult clue to reconcile perfectly. Many chemical riddles contain slight inaccuracies or simplifications. If we assume that the reaction produces phosgene, the stoichiometry might be simplified in the problem statement. The most plausible hazardous product formed from a chlorine carrier (C) and carbon monoxide (D) is phosgene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n*   Phosgene is notoriously hazardous, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous product\". It was used as a chemical warfare agent in WWI.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   We have identified E as phosgene, COCl₂.\n*   To find its molecular symmetry group, we need to analyze its 3D structure.\n*   The phosgene molecule is planar, with a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n        C\n       / \\\n      Cl Cl\n    ```\n*   Let's identify its symmetry elements:\n    1.  **Identity (E)**: All molecules have this.\n    2.  **C₂ axis**: There is a two-fold rotational axis passing through the C=O double bond. Rotating the molecule 180° about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    3.  **Mirror plane (σᵥ)**: There is a mirror plane that contains all three atoms (C, O, Cl, Cl), i.e., the plane of the molecule.\n    4.  **Mirror plane (σᵥ')**: There is a second mirror plane, perpendicular to the first one, that contains the C₂ axis (i.e., it contains the C and O atoms and bisects the Cl-C-Cl angle).\n*   A molecule with the symmetry elements E, C₂, σᵥ, and σᵥ' belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step deduction, the hazardous product E is phosgene (COCl₂). The molecular symmetry group for phosgene is C₂ᵥ. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a step-by-step deduction that reconciles the chemical clues, even with known inconsistencies in this classic riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify A, B, C, F, G:** The most specific clue is the hydrolysis reaction (C + H₂O → A + F + G). This points to a disproportionation. The reaction involving iodine chlorides fits best:\n    *   **A**: I₂ (Iodine, a solid)\n    *   **B**: Cl₂ (Chlorine, a gas)\n    *   **C**: I₂Cl₆ (Iodine trichloride dimer, which is bright yellow, not red—a known flaw in the riddle)\n    *   **F**: HCl (a strong acid)\n    *   **G**: HIO₃ (Iodic acid, a weak acid)\n\n2.  **Identify D and H:** The reaction of two gases (D + B) in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) points to the synthesis of phosgene.\n    *   **D**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n3.  **Identify E:** The reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D produces the \"extremely hazardous\" product E.\n    *   Reaction: I₂Cl₆ + 2CO → 2ICl + 2COCl₂\n    *   The extremely hazardous product, **E**, is **COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E (COCl₂):**\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    *   It possesses a C₂ rotation axis that runs along the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two σv planes belongs to the **C2v** point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio\n\n2.  **Identify the Substances:** This chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying the components. The synthesis of mustard gas provides a consistent fit for all the described reactions.\n\n    *   **Identify D, B, and H:** Let's test the hypothesis that this series of reactions describes the synthesis of mustard gas. The synthesis of the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (H) from ethene (D) and chlorine (B) is a well-known industrial process.\n        *   **D = Ethene (C₂H₄)**, a gas.\n        *   **B = Chlorine (Cl₂)**, a gas.\n        *   **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n        *   Reaction 4: C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction, fitting the description.\n\n    *   **Identify A and C:** Now using B = Cl₂, let's look at Reaction 1.\n        *   A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red product).\n        *   The 1:8 stoichiometry is a major clue. Sulfur exists as a crown-shaped S₈ molecule, which is a solid. The reaction of elemental sulfur with chlorine is:\n        *   S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly if we consider the molecular form of sulfur.\n        *   Therefore, **A = S₈** and **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid. The description of C as a solid might be a slight inaccuracy in the riddle, or it could refer to the substance at a lower temperature.\n\n    *   **Identify E:** Now we can deduce E from Reaction 2.\n        *   C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n        *   SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E.\n        *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n        *   SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S(l). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. So, **E = Mustard Gas**.\n\n    *   **Verify with Reaction 3:** Let's check the hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n        *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is complex, but it is known to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid. It also produces elemental sulfur.\n        *   2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n        *   This fits the products: **F = HCl** (strong acid), **G = H₂SO₃** (weak acid), and the regeneration of elemental sulfur (**A**).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E has been identified as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group, which typically refers to the point group of the molecule in its most stable conformation.\n    *   While the molecule can exist in many shapes, its lowest energy conformations lack high symmetry. The most stable conformers possess **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two ethyl chloride groups.\n    *   The molecule does not possess the vertical mirror planes required for C₂ᵥ symmetry, nor the higher symmetry of D₄h or D∞h groups.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the chemical clues provided, the identities of the substances can be deduced as follows:\n\n*   **A** is the solid element **Gold (Au)**.\n*   **B** is the gas **Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl)**.\n*   **C** is the bright red product **Nitrosonium tetrachloroaurate(III) (NO[AuCl₄])**. The reaction is Au + 4NOCl → NO[AuCl₄] + 3NO. The \"8 equivalents\" in the prompt is a known inaccuracy in this classic riddle.\n*   The hydrolysis of C (NO[AuCl₄]) in water yields elemental gold (A), a strong acid **F** (**Hydrochloric acid, HCl**), and a weak acid **G** (**Nitrous acid, HNO₂**).\n*   The reaction `C + 2D -> E` suggests that E is a product derived from the decomposition or reaction of C. The most fundamental component of C is gold(III) chloride.\n*   **E** is therefore identified as **Gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃)**. While gold compounds are toxic, the term \"extremely hazardous\" is likely an exaggeration for the puzzle's effect.\n*   The molecular structure of monomeric Gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃) is T-shaped, which belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle where several clues have apparent contradictions with common chemical knowledge. A step-by-step deduction, prioritizing the most unique chemical reactions, is necessary to identify the unknown substances.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:** The reaction `D + B -> H` in a 1:1 ratio, where H is a solvent, strongly suggests the formation of phosgene.\n    *   **B** is Chlorine gas (Cl₂).\n    *   **D** is Carbon Monoxide (CO).\n    *   **H** is Phosgene (COCl₂).\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:** The most chemically distinctive clue is the hydrolysis of C: `C + H₂O -> A + F + G`.\n    *   **F** is stated to be a strong acid. Since C is a chloride (formed from B=Cl₂), **F** is Hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    *   **G** is a weak acid containing the element A.\n    *   **A** is a solid element that is reformed during the hydrolysis. This indicates a disproportionation reaction, where the element in compound C is both reduced back to its elemental state (A) and oxidized to form a weak acid (G).\n    *   This specific type of disproportionation is characteristic of Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). When AuCl reacts with water, it disproportionates to form metallic gold (Au) and gold(III) hydroxide (Au(OH)₃, also known as auric acid), which is a weak acid, along with hydrochloric acid.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **A** = Gold (Au)\n        *   **C** = Gold(I) chloride (AuCl). AuCl is a yellow solid, which is a slight contradiction to the \"bright red\" description, possibly an inaccuracy in the puzzle.\n        *   **G** = Auric acid (Au(OH)₃).\n\n3.  **Address Contradictions:** The first reaction, `A (solid) + 8 equivalents of gas B -> C`, does not match the actual synthesis of AuCl from Au and Cl₂ (2Au + Cl₂ -> 2AuCl). This significant discrepancy in stoichiometry is likely an error or a \"red herring\" in the puzzle statement. Given the uniqueness of the hydrolysis reaction, we proceed with the identification of A and C as Au and AuCl.\n\n4.  **Identify E:** The final unknown, E, is formed from the reaction `C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> E`.\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `AuCl + 2 CO -> E`.\n    *   Gold(I) chloride is known to react with carbon monoxide. While the most common product is Au(CO)Cl (a 1:1 adduct), the formation of a dicarbonyl species, **Au(CO)₂Cl**, is plausible under certain conditions and fits the 2-equivalent stoichiometry given.\n    *   This compound, dicarbonylchlorogold(I), is unstable and, like many heavy metal carbonyls, can be considered hazardous.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The task is to find the molecular symmetry group of E = Au(CO)₂Cl.\n    *   As a Gold(I) complex, the central gold atom is three-coordinate. The most stable geometry for such a complex is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule has the structure of a central Au atom bonded to one Cl atom and two CO groups.\n    *   This arrangement results in a planar molecule with a twofold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the Au-Cl bond and a plane of symmetry containing the molecule. This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂ᵥ** point group. Theoretical calculations confirm this geometry.\n\nFinal Answer is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the corrected step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of compound E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction clues to identify the compounds.**\n\n*   **Clue 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (1:1 ratio), H is a solvent. The reaction SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) is a perfect match. Sulfuryl chloride (H) is a solvent. This implies {B, D} = {Cl₂, SO₂}.\n*   **Clue 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). This is a hydrolysis reaction. If C is a chloride, its hydrolysis would produce HCl (a strong acid, F). This suggests B = Cl₂ and D = SO₂.\n*   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product). With B = Cl₂, the reaction is A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C. A well-known reaction involves iodine: I₂(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2ICl(s). Iodine monochloride (ICl) is a red-brown solid, fitting the \"bright red\" description. The 1:8 stoichiometry is likely a red herring, as the qualitative descriptions are chemically consistent.\n*   Let's verify this set of identities with Clue 3 again. If A = I₂ and C = ICl, the hydrolysis is: 5ICl + 3H₂O → 5HCl + HIO₃ + 2I₂. This reaction regenerates solid A (I₂), and produces a strong acid F (HCl) and a weak acid G (HIO₃). This is a perfect fit.\n*   **Summary of Identities:**\n    *   A = I₂ (Iodine)\n    *   B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   C = ICl (Iodine monochloride)\n    *   D = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide)\n    *   F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   G = HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n    *   H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the identity and structure of E.**\n\n*   **Clue 2:** C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.\n*   The reaction is: ICl + 2SO₂ → E.\n*   ICl acts as a Lewis acid and reacts with the Lewis base SO₂ to form the ionic salt [I(SO₂)₂]⁺Cl⁻. The product E is the cation [I(SO₂)₂]⁺. Such reactive species are known to be hazardous.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n\n*   The species is the cation **E = [I(SO₂)₂]⁺**. We need to determine its geometry using VSEPR theory.\n*   The central atom is Iodine. Since the overall charge is +1, we consider the central atom to be I⁺.\n*   Iodine (Group 17) has 7 valence electrons. Therefore, I⁺ has 7 - 1 = 6 valence electrons.\n*   The two SO₂ molecules are the ligands (X), bonded to the central iodine atom (A).\n*   The number of lone pairs (E) on the central atom is calculated as: E = (Valence electrons on I⁺ - electrons used in bonding) / 2. Assuming single bonds to the two sulfur atoms, this is E = (6 - 2) / 2 = 2 lone pairs.\n*   The VSEPR notation for [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ is **AX₂E₂**.\n*   An AX₂E₂ species has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry, which results in a **bent** or **V-shaped** molecular geometry.\n*   A bent molecule of the general formula Y-X-Y has the following symmetry elements:\n    1.  A C₂ rotational axis passing through the central atom (I) and bisecting the Y-X-Y angle (S-I-S angle).\n    2.  Two perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that both contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the S-I-S atoms, and the other is perpendicular to it.\n*   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E, the [I(SO₂)₂]⁺ cation, is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.

This implies that **C is Xenon (Xe)** and **D is Fluorine (F₂)**.\n    *   The description of C as a \"bright red product\" is a known inconsistency in this classic riddle; Xenon is a colorless gas.\n    *   With D identified as F₂, we can look at the reaction D + B → H (solvent). So, F₂ + B → H. A plausible reaction is with bromine to form bromine trifluoride (BrF₃), which can be used as a fluorinating solvent. So, **B could be Br₂** and **H could be BrF₃**.\n    *   The first reaction is A (solid) + 8B (gas) → C (red product). This would be A + 8Br₂ → Xe. This step does not correspond to a known chemical reaction and highlights a flaw in the riddle's construction.\n    *   The third reaction is C + H₂O → A + F + G. This would be Xe + H₂O → A + F + G. Xenon does not react with water under normal conditions, but its fluorides do. For instance, the hydrolysis of XeF₆ produces XeO₃ and HF. This indicates the riddle is not perfectly self-consistent.\n\n*   **Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    Despite the inconsistencies in the narrative clues, the question asks for the molecular symmetry of product E. By identifying E as the well-known and hazardous compound XeF₄, we can determine its structure.\n    *   **E = Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, the central Xenon atom has four bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy the axial positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement around the central xenon atom.\n    *   A square planar molecule belongs to the **D₄h point group**. This point group is characterized by a principal C₄ axis, perpendicular C₂ axes, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and vertical and dihedral mirror planes.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (XeF₄) is D₄h.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step debate to solve the chemical puzzle.\n\n### Self-Debate\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nMy initial approach is to decode the chemical identities of the substances starting with the most concrete clues.\n\n1.  **Clue 3 & 4 Analysis:**\n    *   Clue 4 states that two gases, B and D, react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, H. A common reaction that fits this is 2NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄. Here, gas B and gas D are both NO₂, and the solvent H is dinitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄), which is a liquid solvent.\n    *   Clue 3 states that C reacts with water to form A, a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). If we test our hypothesis that B is NO₂, the hydrolysis of NO₂ in water produces both nitric acid (HNO₃, a strong acid) and nitrous acid (HNO₂, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description of F and G.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis:**\n    *   **B** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **D** = NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide)\n    *   **H** = N₂O₄ (Dinitrogen tetroxide)\n    *   **F** = HNO₃ (Nitric acid)\n    *   **G** = HNO₂ (Nitrous acid)\n\n3.  **Proposed Action:**\n    Based on this strong evidence, I will proceed assuming these identities are correct and attempt to identify the hazardous product E. The remaining clues describe the formation of E:\n    *   A(s) + 8NO₂(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   C + 2NO₂(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n\nThis means E is the result of a reaction between solid A and a total of 10 equivalents of NO₂. E must be a nitrogen-containing compound. A plausible, hazardous nitrogen oxide that can be formed is dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅). I will now search for the molecular symmetry of N₂O₅.\n\n**Role: Skeptic**\nThe Proposer's case hinges on the identification of B and D as NO₂. While this is a strong inference, the subsequent leap to identifying E as N₂O₅ is based on plausibility rather than direct evidence from the clues. The core weakness is the unknown reaction pathway: A(s) + 10NO₂(g) → E. Without knowing what A and C are, we cannot be certain that E is N₂O₅. The puzzle could have a different solution if our initial deduction about B and D is a clever misdirection.\n\nHowever, the search results confirm that gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅) is a known hazardous compound. More importantly, multiple sources state that its equilibrium structure in the gas phase has **C2 symmetry**. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n**Role: Proposer**\nThe Skeptic's point is valid; the chain of deduction has a weak link regarding the specific reaction. However, in the context of a well-posed puzzle, the elegance with which B=D=NO₂ solves two major, independent clues (the specific acid products and the solvent formation) is too powerful to ignore. The puzzle is likely designed around this central deduction. The subsequent steps (A→C→E) may involve obscure chemistry intended to be opaque, forcing the solver to identify the most logical hazardous product, E, based on the established reactants. N₂O₅ is a hazardous nitrogen oxide, and its gaseous C2 symmetry is a perfect fit for the options.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe debate converges. The evidence strongly supports the identification of B and D as NO₂. The most logical hazardous product, E, that could be formed and matches a symmetry option is N₂O₅. The molecular symmetry group for gaseous N₂O₅ is C2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
