The general principle is that the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the constituent elements in their standard states minus the sum of the bond energies of the product molecule.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 2 (from the first (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (in the CH3 group) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH=) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from the second (CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass is approximately (12 × 12 g/mol) + (22 × 1 g/mol) = **166 g/mol**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count all the covalent bonds in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** Counting the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n    *   2 in (CH3)2C=\n    *   1 between =CH- and -CH2-\n    *   1 between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-\n    *   1 between the main chain and the CH3 group\n    *   1 between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-\n    *   1 between -CH2- and -CH=\n    *   2 in =C(CH3)2\n    *   This gives a total of **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)).\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** To get 22 moles of H atoms, we need 11 moles of H2 molecules. The energy required is 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nThis is the energy released when forming all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule.\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   **Total Bond Energy:** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the molecule's bonds.\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/mol):** 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include units of kJ/g, so we convert our result using the molar mass.\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/g):** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization values. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the reactants in their standard state and the energy released during the formation of the product from its gaseous atoms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C`: 3\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `CH2`: 1\n    *   `CH(CH3)`: 2\n    *   `CH2`: 1\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `C(CH3)2`: 3\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms = 12**\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   `(CH3)2C`: 6\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `CH2`: 2\n    *   `CH(CH3)`: 4\n    *   `CH2`: 2\n    *   `CH`: 1\n    *   `C(CH3)2`: 6\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms = 22**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert the reactants into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 moles of solid carbon are converted to gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 moles of H2 molecules are broken into gaseous atoms.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol (for the H-H bond) = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nNext, we determine the number and type of bonds in the C12H22 molecule to calculate the total energy released upon its formation from gaseous atoms.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The formula C12H22 indicates there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The notation `C=C` appears twice, so there are **2 C=C double bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds is the number of atoms minus 1. Here, 12 + 22 - 1 = 33 bonds. The number of C-C single bonds is the total bonds minus the C-H and C=C bonds: 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C single bonds**.\n\nNow, we calculate the total bond energy for the product molecule:\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product** = 8800 kJ + 1800 kJ + 600 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product's bonds.\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants) - (Total Bond Energy of Product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result using the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.01 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of Formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds:\n\n      CH3\n      |\nH3C - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n                         |              |\n                         CH3            CH3\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nBy examining the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   Two CH3 groups attached to the first C=C: 2 bonds\n    *   One bond between =CH- and -CH2-: 1 bond\n    *   One bond between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-: 1 bond\n    *   One bond from the main chain to the CH3 group: 1 bond\n    *   One bond between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-: 1 bond\n    *   One bond between -CH2- and -CH=: 1 bond\n    *   Two CH3 groups attached to the second C=C: 2 bonds\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔH_atom(compound)) is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n**ΔH_atom(C12H22) = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is from its elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants (ΣΔH_atom(reactants)) is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states.\nΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 12 × ΔH_atom(C) + 11 × BE(H-H)\n\nGiven:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H, BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΣΔH_atom(reactants) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 + 1100\n**ΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the enthalpy of atomization of the product (the compound).\n\nΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(reactants) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n**ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert the Answer to the Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g or kJ/mol. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check the options.\n*   A) 1900 kJ/g\n*   B) 11200 kJ/mol\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   D) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol is not directly listed with the correct units. Option A has the right number but wrong units. Option B is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g and see if it matches any option.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass ≈ (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\n**ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**2. List Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly interpret the chemical structure:** The condensed formula must be translated into a full structural formula to accurately count the bonds.\n*   **Determine the molecular formula:** Count the total number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to find the molecular formula (CxHy).\n*   **Accurately count all bonds:** Systematically count the number of C-H, C-C (single), and C=C (double) bonds in the molecule. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Understand the definition of enthalpy of formation:** The enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n    `x C(s, graphite) + (y/2) H2(g) → CxHy(g)`\n*   **Apply Hess's Law:** The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the given bond energies and enthalpy of atomization data via a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    `ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the product:** This is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms. For `x C(s)` and `(y/2) H2(g)`, this is `[x * ΔH_atom(C)] + [(y/2) * BE(H-H)]`.\n*   **Check the units:** The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. The initial calculation will yield a result in kJ/mol. If this doesn't match an option, it must be converted to kJ/g by dividing by the molar mass of the compound.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure, Molecular Formula, and Bond Count**\n\n*   **Structure:** Let's draw the molecule from the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    ```\n         CH3         CH3             CH3\n          |           |               |\n       H3C-C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C-CH3\n                          |\n                          CH3\n    ```\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=C<) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 1 (in CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C<) + 2 (in (CH3)2) = 12 Carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=CH-) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 3 (in CH3) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 6 (in (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom.

The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the elemental reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Types\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (at C=) + 1 (at =CH) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 2 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (at =CH) + 3 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 4 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in =CH) + 6 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of connections between the 12 carbon atoms in a non-cyclic molecule is 11 (n-1). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe formation of C12H22 from its elements in their standard state is represented by the equation:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of solid carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal sum of bond energies in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the sum of the bond energies of the product.\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 5: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options are given in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\n\nFirst, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Chemical Bonds\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule to calculate its total bond energy.\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C bonds.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds. Using the provided bond energies:\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Compound) = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard state (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy for 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen:** The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to form 2 moles of H atoms from 1 mole of H2. We need to form 22 moles of H atoms, which requires 11 moles of H2.\n    *   Energy for 22 moles of Hydrogen = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options provided include units of kJ/g. To compare our result, we convert it using the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option B matches our calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of covalent bond in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms, plus one for each double or triple bond. A simpler method is to count them directly from the structure. For a molecule with 12 carbons and 2 double bonds, there are a total of 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.

This is the energy to break one mole of H2 into two moles of H atoms. We need 22 moles of H atoms.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol (of H2) * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n**Total Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements)** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy of atomization of the elements minus the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements) - (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6.

Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔH_atom(compound)) is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n**ΔH_atom(C12H22) = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4.

Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**2. List Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly interpret the chemical structure:** The condensed formula must be translated into a full structural formula to accurately count the bonds.\n*   **Determine the molecular formula:** Count the total number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to find the molecular formula (CxHy).\n*   **Accurately count all bonds:** Systematically count the number of C-H, C-C (single), and C=C (double) bonds in the molecule. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Understand the definition of enthalpy of formation:** The enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n    `x C(s, graphite) + (y/2) H2(g) → CxHy(g)`\n*   **Apply Hess's Law:** The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the given bond energies and enthalpy of atomization data via a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    `ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the product:** This is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms. For `x C(s)` and `(y/2) H2(g)`, this is `[x * ΔH_atom(C)] + [(y/2) * BE(H-H)]`.\n*   **Check the units:** The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. The initial calculation will yield a result in kJ/mol.

The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the elemental reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Types\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (at C=) + 1 (at =CH) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 2 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (at =CH) + 3 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 4 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in =CH) + 6 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of connections between the 12 carbon atoms in a non-cyclic molecule is 11 (n-1). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe formation of C12H22 from its elements in their standard state is represented by the equation:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of solid carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal sum of bond energies in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the sum of the bond energies of the product.\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 5: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options are given in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\n\nFirst, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 12 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Chemical Bonds\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule to calculate its total bond energy.\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C bonds.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the energy required to break all of its bonds.

This is the energy to form 2 moles of H atoms from 1 mole of H2. We need to form 22 moles of H atoms, which requires 11 moles of H2.\n    *   Energy for 22 moles of Hydrogen = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization (Elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options provided include units of kJ/g.

Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon Atoms (C):** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 3 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Covalent Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of covalent bond in one molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each singly bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms, plus one for each double or triple bond. A simpler method is to count them directly from the structure. For a molecule with 12 carbons and 2 double bonds, there are a total of 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3.
