This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product).

The NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene**: **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **The Diels-Alder Reaction**: This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a bicyclic product. The reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride will produce a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n\n3.  **Stereoisomers (*Endo* and *Exo* Products)**: When a cyclic diene reacts with a dienophile, two diastereomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n    *   The *endo* product is generally the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This preference is due to \"secondary orbital interactions\" between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi-system of the diene in the transition state.\n    *   The *exo* product is typically the minor product. It is often more stable thermodynamically but forms more slowly.\n\n4.  **Product Structures**:\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene skeleton.\n    *   A CH₂ group from the diene forms the C7 bridge.\n    *   Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4).\n    *   Two methyl groups are on the newly formed double bond (C2 and C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6, with a proton at each of these positions.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major)**: The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. The two protons on the anhydride portion (H₅ and H₆) are oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge and are held underneath the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor)**: The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. The protons H₅ and H₆ are oriented *syn* to the C7 bridge.\n\n### NMR Analysis and NOESY Spectroscopy\n\n**NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is an NMR technique that detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected through bonds. A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n\nWe can distinguish between the *endo* and *exo* products by looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is present in one isomer but absent in the other.\n\n1.  **Proton Signal Assignments**: Based on typical chemical shifts for such structures:\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Vinylic methyl groups are more deshielded than saturated ones.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent protons (H₅ and H₆) on the anhydride part of the structure. Their proximity to the carbonyl groups causes a significant downfield shift.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**: This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n2.  **Spatial Relationships and NOESY Cross-Peaks**:\n    *   **In the Major (*Endo*) Product**: The H₅ and H₆ protons (~3.5 ppm) are located directly under the C2=C3 double bond. This places them very close to the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3 (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   **In the Minor (*Exo*) Product**: The H₅ and H₆ protons (~3.5 ppm) are pointed towards the C7 bridge. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm), so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, a cross-peak might be observed between the H₅/H₆ protons and the protons on the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on the stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction, the major product is the *endo* isomer. The unique spatial interaction in the *endo* isomer is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nThis corresponds to a NOESY cross-peak connecting:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons).\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyl protons).\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe analysis of the chemical reaction and the provided spectral data leads to the correct identification of the interacting protons. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identification of Reactants**:\n    *   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This specific set of spectral data points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Its Products**:\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n    *   This reaction typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is generally the major, kinetically favored product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product (C13H16O3) is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14).\n\n3.  **Structural Analysis of Products for NMR Interpretation**:\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n    *   There are four distinct types of protons in the product:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons**: Two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from the maleic anhydride double bond. Their chemical shift is typically around 3-4 ppm. The options suggest a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons**: Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring. Their chemical shift is expected around 1.7-2.0 ppm. The options suggest a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons**: Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Their chemical shift is expected to be further upfield, around 1.0-1.5 ppm. The options suggest a 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge CH2 Protons**: Two protons on the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers with NOESY**:\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), which is crucial for determining stereochemistry.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride part of the molecule is tucked underneath the double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride part points away from the double bond. Consequently, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak connecting the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major (*endo*) product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   The anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Thus, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (at 7 ppm) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (at 137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid.\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to its symmetry, it has only one type of proton (the two vinyl protons), which would appear as a singlet. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinyl protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups. It also has two types of carbons: the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). The peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinyl carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride.\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. The formation of a major and a minor product indicates the formation of *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n*   According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, the longest bridge is the C=C double bond, but the key interaction is with the C7 bridge. The *endo* product has the anhydride ring tucked under the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n*   The **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Major (*endo*) Product**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct and predict its ¹H NMR signals. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. This will be a **6H singlet**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be relatively downfield for methyl groups, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. This will be another **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n*   **Anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, which makes them significantly deshielded. This will be a **2H singlet** around **~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge are not equivalent. One is *syn* to the double bond, and the other is *anti*. They would likely appear as two separate signals, probably doublets due to geminal coupling. The *syn* proton is shielded by the π-system of the double bond and would appear more upfield, around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**4. Analyzing the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** but **absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's compare the spatial relationships in both isomers:\n\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the **anhydride protons** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the ***syn*-proton on the C7 bridge** (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The **anhydride protons** are now far away from the **C7 bridge protons**. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them. Instead, in the *exo* isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe NOE cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the *syn*-C7 bridge proton. Based on our chemical shift assignments:\n\n*   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   *syn*-C7 bridge proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nNow let's match this with the given options:\n\nA) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This matches our analysis perfectly. These are the *syn*-C7 proton and the anhydride protons, which are close in the *endo* adduct.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: These are the bridgehead methyls and the *syn*-C7 proton. They are close in both isomers.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: These are the bridgehead methyls and the vinyl methyls. They are close in both isomers.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: These are the vinyl methyls and the anhydride protons. They are far apart in the *endo* (major) product but close in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the opposite of what is described.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak observed in the major product connects the resonances described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single `1H NMR` peak at 7 ppm and two `13C NMR` peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The single `1H NMR` peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic (alkene) protons.\n    *   The two `13C NMR` peaks correspond to the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm). The fact that there are only two peaks indicates high symmetry, with the two alkene carbons being equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons being equivalent.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid).\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bond carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, the major product formed under kinetic control is the **endo** product, while the minor product is the **exo** product. The endo product is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3 (C9H14 from the diene + C4H2O3 from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products**\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system formed, the C7 carbon (from the CH2 group of the diene) forms a one-carbon bridge.\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is attached (let's call them `H_anhydride`) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (pointing away from the C7 bridge).\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face of the bicyclic system (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY NMR to Distinguish the Isomers**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the endo isomer but far apart in the exo isomer.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Spatially Close Protons in Each Isomer**\n\nLet's identify the key protons and their locations:\n*   `H_anhydride`: The two equivalent protons on the saturated part of the anhydride ring.\n*   `Me_bridgehead`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are on the *exo* face.\n*   `Me_vinyl`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). These are on the *endo* face.\n*   `H_bridge`: The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge. One is *syn* to the double bond (`H_syn`, on the *endo* face) and one is *anti* to the double bond (`H_anti`, on the *exo* face).\n\nNow, let's analyze the proximities:\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:**\n    *   The `H_anhydride` protons are on the *exo* face.\n    *   They are close to other protons on the *exo* face: `H_anti` and the `Me_bridgehead` groups.\n    *   They are far from protons on the *endo* face: `H_syn` and the `Me_vinyl` groups.\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:**\n    *   The `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face.\n    *   They are close to other protons on the *endo* face: `H_syn` and the `Me_vinyl` groups.\n    *   They are far from protons on the *exo* face: `H_anti` and the `Me_bridgehead` groups.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be between `H_anhydride` and either `H_anti` or `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n**Step 6: Assign NMR Signals and Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's assign the signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent `H_anhydride` protons, which are alpha to carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the `Me_vinyl` groups (methyls on a double bond).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This corresponds to the `Me_bridgehead` groups (methyls on saturated carbons, more shielded).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This corresponds to one of the C7 bridge protons (`H_syn` or `H_anti`). Given its proximity to other groups on the exo face in the major product, this is likely `H_anti`.\n\nNow, let's check the options against the expected NOE for the major product (`H_anhydride` <-> `H_anti` or `H_anhydride` <-> `Me_bridgehead`):\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`):** This interaction is strong in the *minor* (exo) product, not the major.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`):** These groups are on opposite faces of the molecule and would not show a strong, distinguishing NOE.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_anti`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`):** This corresponds to the `H_anti` <-> `H_anhydride` interaction. Both protons are on the *exo* face in the major (endo) product, so they are close. In the minor (exo) product, they are on opposite faces and far apart. This perfectly matches the description.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_anti`):** Both of these are on the *exo* face in both the major and minor isomers. An NOE would be expected in both products, so it is not a distinguishing cross-peak.\n\nThe only option that describes a cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to identify the reactants, predict the products of a Diels-Alder reaction, and then use our understanding of 3D structure and NOESY NMR to pinpoint a specific interaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n\n*   The starting material is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The simplest such acid is maleic acid.\n*   Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n*   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the NMR data:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak, which is consistent with the given data (a singlet at 7 ppm).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C). This is consistent with the two observed peaks. The chemical shifts are also appropriate: ~165 ppm for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride and ~137 ppm for an alkene carbon.\n*   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 3: The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **endo rule** in Diels-Alder reactions states that the product with the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) oriented \"under\" the newly formed double bond is kinetically favored and is thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the problem statement.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Predict the NOESY Correlation**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments in the Product:**\n    *   **Vinylic methyls:** Two methyl groups on the C=C bond. They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** Two methine protons on the bicyclic frame, adjacent to the anhydride carbonyls. They are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge protons:** Two protons on the CH₂ bridge. They are diastereotopic and would give complex signals, with one likely appearing as a doublet around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis:**\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons (2H, ~3.5 ppm)** very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (6H, ~1.7 ppm)**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointed away from the C=C double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is large. Therefore, no significant NOE cross-peak would be observed between them.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Analysis with the Given Options**\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). This interaction is not unique to the endo product.\nB) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).** This perfectly matches our analysis.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). While some interaction might exist, the one described in B is the most prominent and distinguishing feature between the endo and exo isomers.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not particularly close in either isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that describes the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which is characteristic of the major *endo* product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak at ~7 ppm for a molecule with a C=C double bond suggests two chemically equivalent vinylic protons. This high symmetry, combined with the description, points strongly to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's verify with the ¹³C NMR data. Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: the two vinylic carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O). The chemical shift for vinylic carbons is typically 100-150 ppm, and for carbonyl carbons in an anhydride, it's around 160-170 ppm. The given peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) perfectly match the structure of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclic diene with a five-membered ring. It has methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that two products (a major and a minor) are formed.\n    *   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer. This is the kinetic product, favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major (*endo*) Product for NOESY**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a NOE cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n        *   The C7 bridge is the CH₂ group from the original diene.\n        *   The double bond in the new six-membered ring has two methyl groups on it.\n        *   The bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) each have a methyl group.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C=C double bond bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are pointing towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two diastereotopic protons, one pointing towards the double bond (*syn*) and one pointing away (*anti*). In the *endo* geometry, the H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the *anti* proton of the C7 bridge.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, pointing away from the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. They are, however, closer to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The key spatial difference is the proximity between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. This distance is short in the major (*endo*) product and long in the minor (*exo*) product. Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak connecting these two types of protons will be strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product.\n\n4.  **Match Protons to NMR Signals and Options**\n\n    *   We need to identify the NMR signals corresponding to the H_anhydride protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n        *   **H_anhydride:** Due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule, the two H_anhydride protons are chemically equivalent. They are not coupled to other protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3-4 ppm) because they are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **C7 bridge protons:** These two protons are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic) and will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as two separate **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1-2 ppm range for bicyclic systems.\n\n    *   So, the distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between a **2H singlet** and a **1H doublet**.\n\n    *   Now let's examine the given options:\n        *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. The 1H doublet is one of the C7 bridge protons, and the 2H singlet is the H_anhydride protons. The chemical shifts are very reasonable for these respective protons.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This would be a methyl group and a C7 proton. These are not uniquely close in the major product.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be a methyl group and the H_anhydride protons. This interaction is expected to be strong in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major (*endo*) one.\n        *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups. This NOE would be present in both isomers and is not the distinguishing feature.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons and one of the 1H doublets of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: 137 ppm (characteristic of an alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, C=O).\n    *   The simplest structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (giving one ¹H signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons), which matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n    *Structure of Maleic Anhydride (the dienophile):*\n    ```\n        O\n       // \\\n      C   C=O\n      |   |\n      C   C=O\n       \\\\ /\n        O\n    ```\n    (With two H atoms on the double bond).\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n    *Structure of the Diene:*\n    ```\n          Me   Me\n          |    |\n       C1==C2\n      /      \\\n    H2C5        C3==C4\n              |    |\n              Me   Me\n    ```\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**3. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. In this case, it's a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n*   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** product and the ***exo*** product.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that the kinetically favored product is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented under the newly forming pi system of the diene. This is the ***endo*** **adduct**.\n    *   The ***exo*** **adduct** is sterically less hindered and is the thermodynamically favored product.\n    *   The problem states a **major** and a **minor** product are formed. In most Diels-Alder reactions under kinetic control, the ***endo*** **product is major** and the ***exo*** **product is minor**.\n\n*   **Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The product is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's analyze the key proton groups in the product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_alk):** Two methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. They are equivalent. **Signal: 6H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two methyl groups on the C1 and C4 bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. **Signal: 6H singlet**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (H_anhyd):** Two protons on C5 and C6, where the anhydride is fused. They are equivalent. **Signal: 2H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They will give two separate signals, likely complex multiplets or doublets.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent/weak in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *exo* adduct (minor).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships in the Isomers:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring (with H_anhyd) is tucked *under* the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_anhyd** protons very close to the **vinylic methyls (Me_alk)**.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge, pointing *away* from the C2=C3 double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhyd** protons are far from the **Me_alk** groups.\n\n*   **Conclusion from NOESY:** The cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons (H_anhyd)** and the **vinylic methyls (Me_alk)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton types to the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_alk):** Methyl groups on a double bond typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best match.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_anhyd):** These protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. They are significantly deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons. They are more shielded. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is a good fit.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** Protons on the methylene bridge. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these.\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n\n*   This corresponds to option **B**.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and H_bridge (~1.5 ppm): Their spatial relationship is similar in both isomers.\n*   C) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and Me_alk (~1.7 ppm): Their spatial relationship is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) H_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhyd (~3.5 ppm): These protons are close in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the only logical answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants**: Use the provided information (dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, dehydration, NMR data) to deduce the structure of the anhydride (the dienophile). The diene is explicitly named.\n2.  **Determine the products**: Draw the structures of the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products from the Diels-Alder reaction between the identified diene and dienophile.\n3.  **Analyze spatial proximity**: Compare the 3D structures of the *endo* and *exo* products to find a pair of protons that are close in space (< 5 Å) in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This proximity will cause the unique NOESY cross-peak.\n4.  **Assign NMR signals**: Match the proton signals described in the answer choices (e.g., 6H singlet at ~1 ppm) to the specific protons in the product structure based on chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity.\n5.  **Combine and conclude**: Combine the spatial analysis from step 3 with the signal assignments from step 4 to identify the two resonances connected by the cross-peak and select the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n*   **Dienophile**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The simplest such acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   The NMR data for the anhydride confirms this:\n        *   ¹H NMR: Maleic anhydride is symmetrical, so the two alkene protons are equivalent, giving a single peak (given as 7 ppm).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, giving two peaks (given as 137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene**: The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2 & 3: Determine Products and Analyze Spatial Proximity**\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. This reaction typically forms a major *endo* product (kinetic control) and a minor *exo* product (thermodynamic control). The key difference for NOESY analysis is the relative orientation of the anhydride ring and the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n*   **Major (Endo) Product**: The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are spatially close to the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge (the bridge proton pointing towards the anhydride).\n*   **Minor (Exo) Product**: The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. Here, the H_anhydride protons are far away from the C7 bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**Step 4: Assign NMR Signals**\nNow, let's assign the signals given in the options to the protons in the product structure.\n\n*   **Protons in the product**:\n    *   Two equivalent protons from the original maleic anhydride (H_anhydride).\n    *   Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinyl methyls).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n*   **Signal Assignments**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent **H_anhydride** protons. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, hence their downfield shift. They are a singlet due to symmetry.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is one of the **C7 bridge protons**. The two bridge protons are non-equivalent and split each other into doublets (geminal coupling). A shift of ~1.5 ppm is typical for such an aliphatic proton.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent **bridgehead methyl groups**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine and Conclude**\nFrom our analysis, the unique NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the H_anhydride protons with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   A C7 bridge proton corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThe cross-peak is between these two signals. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Breakdown of the Reaction and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n2.  **Product Formation**: This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n3.  **The \"Endo Rule\"**: In most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This preference is due to a stabilizing interaction between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n4.  **Identifying Endo vs. Exo**:\n    *   In the context of a cyclopentadiene diene, the bicyclic product has a one-carbon bridge (C7).\n    *   The **endo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the larger six-membered ring, on the opposite side of the one-carbon bridge. This places the anhydride protons close to the vinyl methyl groups on the newly formed double bond.\n    *   The **exo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side as the one-carbon bridge, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups.\n\n### Analyzing the NMR Data\n\n*   **Product Structure**: The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry, the molecule has:\n    *   Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion (H-5 and H-6).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinyl methyls).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (bridgehead methyls).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signals**:\n    *   The two anhydride protons (H-5, H-6) are adjacent to carbonyl groups and are in a rigid bicyclic system. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The six protons of the two vinyl methyl groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The six protons of the two bridgehead methyl groups are also equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**, but at a more shielded (lower) chemical shift, likely around ~1.0-1.2 ppm.\n\n*   **2D NOESY Spectrum**: This technique shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This key difference allows us to identify the major product's stereochemistry.\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups, so this cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\nBased on the typical chemical shifts:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to the anhydride protons.\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the vinyl methyl protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR spectrum. This spectroscopic data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single ¹H peak, and by symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the Alder endo rule, the **endo adduct is the major product** (formed faster, kinetic control), and the **exo adduct is the minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Structure and Proton Assignments of the Products:**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the resulting bicyclic structure and assign the signals given in the options:\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_C):** These are the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring fused to the main frame. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent. They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so they will be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to these protons.\n    *   **Alkene Methyl Protons (Me_alkene):** These are the four methyl groups from the C1, C2, C3, and C4 positions of the diene. In the product, two are on the new C=C double bond, and two are at the bridgehead carbons. The methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls) are less shielded than those on saturated carbons. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Me_bridgehead):** The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** This is the former C5-CH₂ group of the diene, which now forms the C7 bridge of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system. The two protons are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are coupled to each other, so they should appear as two doublets. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n4.  **NOESY Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons has this relationship.\n\n    *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the larger ring system.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_C, ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_C, ~3.5 ppm) are also close to the *syn* proton of the C7 methylene bridge (one of the protons around ~1.5 ppm).\n        *   Therefore, in the *endo* isomer, we expect to see NOE cross-peaks for both **(H_C ↔ Me_alkene)** and **(H_C ↔ H_bridge-syn)**.\n\n    *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the larger ring system.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_C, ~3.5 ppm) are now far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm) and the C7 bridge protons.\n        *   Instead, they are now close to the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead, ~1.0 ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peaks for **(H_C ↔ Me_alkene)** and **(H_C ↔ H_bridge-syn)** will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_C). This interaction is strong in the major (*endo*) product and weak/absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This is a possible answer.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers, so this peak would not distinguish them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_C). This interaction is strong in the major (*endo*) product and weak/absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This is also a possible answer.\n\n6.  **Choosing Between A and D:**\n    Both options A and D describe NOE correlations that correctly identify the major (*endo*) isomer. However, we must choose the best description. The intensity of a NOESY cross-peak is proportional to the number of protons involved and inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between them (1/r⁶).\n    *   Interaction A is between a 2H signal and a 1H signal.\n    *   Interaction D is between a 2H signal and a 6H signal.\n\n    Assuming the distances are comparably short in the *endo* adduct (which they are), the cross-peak for interaction D will be significantly more intense because it involves a larger number of protons (a 6H singlet vs. a 1H doublet). This strong, prominent cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is a classic and unambiguous indicator of the *endo* stereochemistry in this type of adduct. It is very likely \"the\" cross-peak the question refers to.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connecting the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, meaning all its protons are chemically equivalent. The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give the single ¹H NMR peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene, two carbonyl) give the two ¹³C NMR peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This molecule has a five-membered ring with double bonds between carbons 1-2 and 3-4, methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a CH₂ group at carbon 5.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is thermodynamically more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Structure and ¹H NMR Assignments of Products:**\n    The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. We can predict the approximate ¹H NMR signals based on the structure:\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the new six-membered ring. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead carbons (carbons where the rings are fused). They are also equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons from the original maleic anhydride are now part of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent and adjacent to the carbonyl groups. This gives a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons from the CH₂ group of the diene now form the one-carbon bridge (C7). They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). One is *syn* (closer to the double bond) and the other is *anti* (further from the double bond). They will appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Analysis:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak that is present in the **major (*endo*) product** but absent or weak in the **minor (*exo*) product**.\n\n5.  **Spatial Relationships in Endo vs. Exo Isomers:**\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the one-carbon bridge. In this orientation, the **anhydride protons** are spatially close to the ***anti* bridge proton**.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the one-carbon bridge. In this orientation, the **anhydride protons** are far from the *anti* bridge proton but are close to the *syn* bridge proton and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H):** These protons are relatively close in both isomers. This cross-peak would not be unique to the major product.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me):** These groups are far apart in both isomers. No significant cross-peak is expected.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H):** This proximity exists in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is described.\n    *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H):**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons are close to the *anti* bridge proton. This will produce a NOESY cross-peak.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the *anti* bridge proton (they are close to the *syn* proton instead).\n        *   Therefore, a cross-peak connecting the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and one specific bridge proton (~1.5 ppm, which must be the *anti* proton) will be present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum.\n\nThis analysis matches the experimental observation described in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that can be solved by identifying the reactants, predicting the reaction products, and using the principles of 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm (alkene protons), and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The *cis* configuration is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic compound.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* product.\n    *   According to the \"endo rule,\" the major product of a kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reaction is typically the **endo isomer**. This is because of a stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The minor product is the **exo isomer**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major (Endo) and Minor (Exo) Products:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In this isomer, the anhydride portion of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In this isomer, the anhydride portion points \"away\" from the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n4.  **Apply NOESY Spectroscopy Principles:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NMR Data and NOESY Cross-Peaks:**\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product and their expected NMR signals. Due to a plane of symmetry in the product, we expect:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the five-membered anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system, so their signal will be downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are no longer all equivalent. The two methyl groups attached to the remaining double bond are equivalent to each other. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are also equivalent to each other. Being on saturated carbons, they are more shielded (upfield). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are not equivalent and would appear as two 1H signals, likely doublets. One is mentioned as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) are tucked underneath the bicyclic system. This position brings them very close to the vinyl methyl groups (6H at ~1.7 ppm) which are also on the \"bottom\" face of the molecule.\n        *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride protons are on the \"top\" face of the molecule, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups. The distance between them is large.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** A strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons is expected for the major (*endo*) product, while this cross-peak would be absent or very weak for the minor (*exo*) product. This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\nThe two resonances connected by this cross-peak are therefore the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis correctly identifies the reactants as maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. Due to significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the *exo* isomer is the major product, while the *endo* isomer is the minor product.\n\nIn the major (*exo*) product, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicyclic system. This spatial arrangement brings the two protons on the anhydride ring (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the six protons of the two methyl groups attached to the double bond (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). This proximity results in a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.\n\nIn the minor (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, far from these methyl groups, so this cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Therefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n### Breakdown of the Chemical Puzzle\n\n1.  **The Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to its anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is known to produce a bicyclic product. When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n4.  **The Products (Major and Minor):** The reaction yields a major and a minor product, which are the *endo* and *exo* isomers. According to the \"endo rule\" for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. This is due to a stabilizing secondary orbital interaction in the transition state. The minor product is the *exo* isomer, which is often more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly.\n\n    *   **Structure:** The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n        *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge.\n        *   The four methyl groups are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   The maleic anhydride part forms a fused ring at positions C2 and C3. The two protons from the anhydride are now attached to C2 and C3.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the C5-C6 double bond. In this arrangement, the two protons on the anhydride portion (Hₐ) point away from the double bond and towards the C7 methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5-C6 double bond. Here, the Hₐ protons point towards the C5-C6 double bond.\n\n5.  **NMR Analysis and the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This allows us to distinguish the isomers.\n    *   **Proton Signal Assignments (based on typical chemical shifts):**\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons (Hₐ) on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the C5-C6 double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal corresponds to one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Specifically, it is the *syn* proton (Hₛᵧₙ), which is shielded by the π-electron cloud of the nearby C5-C6 double bond, causing it to appear at a higher field (lower ppm) than its partner. It appears as a doublet due to coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n    *   **Identifying the Crucial NOE:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons (Hₐ, ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (Hₛᵧₙ, ~1.5 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons (Hₐ, ~3.5 ppm) are far from the C7 bridge protons but are close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). A cross-peak would be expected between the signals at ~3.5 ppm and ~1.7 ppm for this isomer.\n\nSince the unique cross-peak is observed in the **major product**, it must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the *syn*-methylene bridge proton. This corresponds to the resonances at approximately 3.5 ppm (a 2H singlet) and 1.5 ppm (a 1H doublet).\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Incorrect. These protons are far apart.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Incorrect. This cross-peak would be characteristic of the *minor* product.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** **Correct.** This describes the interaction between the *syn*-C7 proton and the anhydride protons in the major *endo* adduct.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Incorrect. These methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring system and are not close enough for a significant NOE.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **Proposer:** The problem describes a Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The reaction produces two stereoisomers, a major and a minor product. These are the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The key to solving the problem is to identify the major product and then determine which protons are close enough in space to produce a NOESY cross-peak. Based on the symmetry of the reactants, the product will have a plane of symmetry, leading to three distinct proton signals: a 2H singlet for the protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H_anhydride), a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic), and a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated carbons (Me_alkyl). Based on typical chemical shifts, H_anhydride would be around 3.5 ppm, Me_vinylic around 1.7 ppm, and Me_alkyl around 1.0 ppm. The Alder-endo rule predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major kinetic product. In the *endo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the Me_alkyl protons. This would predict a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm. However, this is not among the options. I propose that due to the significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the Alder-endo rule is reversed, and the *exo* adduct is the major product. In the *exo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons are close to the Me_vinylic protons. This would result in a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This corresponds to option A. My proposed action is to search for evidence that Diels-Alder reactions with heavily substituted dienes can favor the *exo* product.\n\n*   **Skeptic:** Your hypothesis that steric hindrance reverses the normal *endo* selectivity is plausible. The four methyl groups on the diene create a very crowded environment, and the *exo* transition state would likely be less sterically hindered than the *endo* transition state. Your assignment of chemical shifts also seems reasonable. If your hypothesis is correct, then Option A is the logical answer. The search results confirm that while the *endo* product is the kinetic product in the classic cyclopentadiene + maleic anhydride reaction, the rule is not absolute and can be reversed by other factors, including steric hindrance. The search results also confirm the expected spatial relationships for NOESY analysis in *endo* and *exo* isomers. Although no direct example for 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene was found, the principle that severe steric hindrance can override the electronic preference for the *endo* product is well-established. Therefore, the conclusion that the *exo* product is major in this case is the most logical explanation that fits the provided options.\n\n*   **Decision:** The debate converges on the conclusion that steric hindrance makes the *exo* adduct the major product. In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet). This proximity will create a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

It is often more stable thermodynamically but forms more slowly.\n\n4.  **Product Structures**:\n    *   The reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene skeleton.\n    *   A CH₂ group from the diene forms the C7 bridge.\n    *   Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4).\n    *   Two methyl groups are on the newly formed double bond (C2 and C3).\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C5 and C6, with a proton at each of these positions.\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major)**: The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. The two protons on the anhydride portion (H₅ and H₆) are oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge and are held underneath the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor)**: The anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. The protons H₅ and H₆ are oriented *syn* to the C7 bridge.\n\n### NMR Analysis and NOESY Spectroscopy\n\n**NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** is an NMR technique that detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected through bonds. A cross-peak between two signals indicates spatial proximity.\n\nWe can distinguish between the *endo* and *exo* products by looking for a NOESY cross-peak that is present in one isomer but absent in the other.\n\n1.  **Proton Signal Assignments**: Based on typical chemical shifts for such structures:\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). Vinylic methyl groups are more deshielded than saturated ones.\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent protons (H₅ and H₆) on the anhydride part of the structure. Their proximity to the carbonyl groups causes a significant downfield shift.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**: This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n2.  **Spatial Relationships and NOESY Cross-Peaks**:\n    *   **In the Major (*Endo*) Product**: The H₅ and H₆ protons (~3.5 ppm) are located directly under the C2=C3 double bond. This places them very close to the vinylic methyl groups at C2 and C3 (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   **In the Minor (*Exo*) Product**: The H₅ and H₆ protons (~3.5 ppm) are pointed towards the C7 bridge. They are far from the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm), so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, a cross-peak might be observed between the H₅/H₆ protons and the protons on the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. Based on the stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction, the major product is the *endo* isomer. The unique spatial interaction in the *endo* isomer is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\nThis corresponds to a NOESY cross-peak connecting:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons).\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyl protons).\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe analysis of the chemical reaction and the provided spectral data leads to the correct identification of the interacting protons. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identification of Reactants**:\n    *   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that, upon dehydration, forms an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all its protons are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n    *   This specific set of spectral data points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Its Products**:\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring.\n    *   This reaction typically yields two major stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is generally the major, kinetically favored product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product (C13H16O3) is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H14).\n\n3.  **Structural Analysis of Products for NMR Interpretation**:\n    *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n    *   There are four distinct types of protons in the product:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons**: Two equivalent protons on the carbons originating from the maleic anhydride double bond. Their chemical shift is typically around 3-4 ppm. The options suggest a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons**: Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring. Their chemical shift is expected around 1.7-2.0 ppm. The options suggest a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons**: Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Their chemical shift is expected to be further upfield, around 1.0-1.5 ppm. The options suggest a 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge CH2 Protons**: Two protons on the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing *Endo* and *Exo* Isomers with NOESY**:\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), which is crucial for determining stereochemistry.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride part of the molecule is tucked underneath the double bond of the bicycloheptene system. This geometry brings the anhydride protons into close proximity with the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride part points away from the double bond. Consequently, the anhydride protons are far from the vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak connecting the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons will be present (or strong) in the spectrum of the major (*endo*) product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The cross-peak that distinguishes the major product is between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   The anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   The vinylic methyl protons correspond to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   Thus, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (at 7 ppm) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (at 137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid.\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to its symmetry, it has only one type of proton (the two vinyl protons), which would appear as a singlet. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinyl protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups. It also has two types of carbons: the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). The peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinyl carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride.\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. The formation of a major and a minor product indicates the formation of *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n*   According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, the longest bridge is the C=C double bond, but the key interaction is with the C7 bridge. The *endo* product has the anhydride ring tucked under the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n*   The **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Major (*endo*) Product**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct and predict its ¹H NMR signals. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. This will be a **6H singlet**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be relatively downfield for methyl groups, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. This will be another **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n*   **Anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, which makes them significantly deshielded. This will be a **2H singlet** around **~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge are not equivalent. One is *syn* to the double bond, and the other is *anti*. They would likely appear as two separate signals, probably doublets due to geminal coupling. The *syn* proton is shielded by the π-system of the double bond and would appear more upfield, around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**4. Analyzing the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** but **absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's compare the spatial relationships in both isomers:\n\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the **anhydride protons** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the ***syn*-proton on the C7 bridge** (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The **anhydride protons** are now far away from the **C7 bridge protons**. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them. Instead, in the *exo* isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe NOE cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the *syn*-C7 bridge proton. Based on our chemical shift assignments:\n\n*   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   *syn*-C7 bridge proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nNow let's match this with the given options:\n\nA) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This matches our analysis perfectly. These are the *syn*-C7 proton and the anhydride protons, which are close in the *endo* adduct.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: These are the bridgehead methyls and the *syn*-C7 proton. They are close in both isomers.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: These are the bridgehead methyls and the vinyl methyls. They are close in both isomers.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: These are the vinyl methyls and the anhydride protons. They are far apart in the *endo* (major) product but close in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the opposite of what is described.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak observed in the major product connects the resonances described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single `1H NMR` peak at 7 ppm and two `13C NMR` peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The single `1H NMR` peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic (alkene) protons.\n    *   The two `13C NMR` peaks correspond to the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm). The fact that there are only two peaks indicates high symmetry, with the two alkene carbons being equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons being equivalent.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid).\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bond carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, the major product formed under kinetic control is the **endo** product, while the minor product is the **exo** product. The endo product is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3 (C9H14 from the diene + C4H2O3 from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products**\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system formed, the C7 carbon (from the CH2 group of the diene) forms a one-carbon bridge.\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is attached (let's call them `H_anhydride`) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (pointing away from the C7 bridge).\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face of the bicyclic system (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY NMR to Distinguish the Isomers**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the endo isomer but far apart in the exo isomer.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Spatially Close Protons in Each Isomer**\n\nLet's identify the key protons and their locations:\n*   `H_anhydride`: The two equivalent protons on the saturated part of the anhydride ring.\n*   `Me_bridgehead`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are on the *exo* face.\n*   `Me_vinyl`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). These are on the *endo* face.\n*   `H_bridge`: The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge. One is *syn* to the double bond (`H_syn`, on the *endo* face) and one is *anti* to the double bond (`H_anti`, on the *exo* face).\n\nNow, let's analyze the proximities:\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:**\n    *   The `H_anhydride` protons are on the *exo* face.\n    *   They are close to other protons on the *exo* face: `H_anti` and the `Me_bridgehead` groups.\n    *   They are far from protons on the *endo* face: `H_syn` and the `Me_vinyl` groups.\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:**\n    *   The `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face.\n    *   They are close to other protons on the *endo* face: `H_syn` and the `Me_vinyl` groups.\n    *   They are far from protons on the *exo* face: `H_anti` and the `Me_bridgehead` groups.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be between `H_anhydride` and either `H_anti` or `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n**Step 6: Assign NMR Signals and Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's assign the signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent `H_anhydride` protons, which are alpha to carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the `Me_vinyl` groups (methyls on a double bond).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This corresponds to the `Me_bridgehead` groups (methyls on saturated carbons, more shielded).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This corresponds to one of the C7 bridge protons (`H_syn` or `H_anti`). Given its proximity to other groups on the exo face in the major product, this is likely `H_anti`.\n\nNow, let's check the options against the expected NOE for the major product (`H_anhydride` <-> `H_anti` or `H_anhydride` <-> `Me_bridgehead`):\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`):** This interaction is strong in the *minor* (exo) product, not the major.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`):** These groups are on opposite faces of the molecule and would not show a strong, distinguishing NOE.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_anti`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`):** This corresponds to the `H_anti` <-> `H_anhydride` interaction. Both protons are on the *exo* face in the major (endo) product, so they are close. In the minor (exo) product, they are on opposite faces and far apart. This perfectly matches the description.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_anti`):** Both of these are on the *exo* face in both the major and minor isomers. An NOE would be expected in both products, so it is not a distinguishing cross-peak.\n\nThe only option that describes a cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to identify the reactants, predict the products of a Diels-Alder reaction, and then use our understanding of 3D structure and NOESY NMR to pinpoint a specific interaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Dienophile**\n\n*   The starting material is a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The simplest such acid is maleic acid.\n*   Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n*   Let's check if maleic anhydride fits the NMR data:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons chemically equivalent. This would result in a single peak, which is consistent with the given data (a singlet at 7 ppm).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two types of carbons: the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O) and the two equivalent vinylic carbons (C=C). This is consistent with the two observed peaks. The chemical shifts are also appropriate: ~165 ppm for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride and ~137 ppm for an alkene carbon.\n*   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Diene**\n\n*   The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 3: The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. Because the dienophile can approach the diene from two different faces, two stereoisomers are possible: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **endo rule** in Diels-Alder reactions states that the product with the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) oriented \"under\" the newly formed double bond is kinetically favored and is thus the **major product**. The *exo* product is the **minor product**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the problem statement.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structures and Predict the NOESY Correlation**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n*   **Proton Assignments in the Product:**\n    *   **Vinylic methyls:** Two methyl groups on the C=C bond. They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyls:** Two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride protons:** Two methine protons on the bicyclic frame, adjacent to the anhydride carbonyls. They are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge protons:** Two protons on the CH₂ bridge. They are diastereotopic and would give complex signals, with one likely appearing as a doublet around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis:**\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. This brings the **anhydride protons (2H, ~3.5 ppm)** very close to the **vinylic methyl groups (6H, ~1.7 ppm)**. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointed away from the C=C double bond. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is large. Therefore, no significant NOE cross-peak would be observed between them.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Analysis with the Given Options**\n\nThe unique cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   Vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). This interaction is not unique to the endo product.\nB) **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).** This perfectly matches our analysis.\nC) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). While some interaction might exist, the one described in B is the most prominent and distinguishing feature between the endo and exo isomers.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are not particularly close in either isomer.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that describes the spatial proximity between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons, which is characteristic of the major *endo* product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   A single ¹H NMR peak at ~7 ppm for a molecule with a C=C double bond suggests two chemically equivalent vinylic protons. This high symmetry, combined with the description, points strongly to **maleic anhydride**.\n        *   Let's verify with the ¹³C NMR data. Maleic anhydride has two types of carbon atoms: the two vinylic carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O). The chemical shift for vinylic carbons is typically 100-150 ppm, and for carbonyl carbons in an anhydride, it's around 160-170 ppm. The given peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) perfectly match the structure of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃).\n\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclic diene with a five-membered ring. It has methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product should be the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The problem states that two products (a major and a minor) are formed.\n    *   According to the **Alder-endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer. This is the kinetic product, favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The *exo* isomer is the minor product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major (*endo*) Product for NOESY**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a NOE cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This means we need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n        *   The C7 bridge is the CH₂ group from the original diene.\n        *   The double bond in the new six-membered ring has two methyl groups on it.\n        *   The bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) each have a methyl group.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused to the bicyclic system.\n\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C=C double bond bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are pointing towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two diastereotopic protons, one pointing towards the double bond (*syn*) and one pointing away (*anti*). In the *endo* geometry, the H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the *anti* proton of the C7 bridge.\n\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, pointing away from the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the H_anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. They are, however, closer to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The key spatial difference is the proximity between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons. This distance is short in the major (*endo*) product and long in the minor (*exo*) product. Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak connecting these two types of protons will be strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product.\n\n4.  **Match Protons to NMR Signals and Options**\n\n    *   We need to identify the NMR signals corresponding to the H_anhydride protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n        *   **H_anhydride:** Due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule, the two H_anhydride protons are chemically equivalent. They are not coupled to other protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift will be relatively high (~3-4 ppm) because they are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   **C7 bridge protons:** These two protons are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic) and will couple to each other (geminal coupling), appearing as two separate **1H doublets**. Their chemical shifts are typically in the 1-2 ppm range for bicyclic systems.\n\n    *   So, the distinguishing NOESY cross-peak in the major product is between a **2H singlet** and a **1H doublet**.\n\n    *   Now let's examine the given options:\n        *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches our analysis. The 1H doublet is one of the C7 bridge protons, and the 2H singlet is the H_anhydride protons. The chemical shifts are very reasonable for these respective protons.\n        *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This would be a methyl group and a C7 proton. These are not uniquely close in the major product.\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This would be a methyl group and the H_anhydride protons. This interaction is expected to be strong in the minor (*exo*) product, not the major (*endo*) one.\n        *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be an interaction between the two different sets of methyl groups. This NOE would be present in both isomers and is not the distinguishing feature.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the 2H singlet of the anhydride protons and one of the 1H doublets of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of alkene protons.\n    *   The anhydride's ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: 137 ppm (characteristic of an alkene carbon, C=C) and 165 ppm (characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, C=O).\n    *   The simplest structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (giving one ¹H signal) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons), which matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n    *Structure of Maleic Anhydride (the dienophile):*\n    ```\n        O\n       // \\\n      C   C=O\n      |   |\n      C   C=O\n       \\\\ /\n        O\n    ```\n    (With two H atoms on the double bond).\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n    *Structure of the Diene:*\n    ```\n          Me   Me\n          |    |\n       C1==C2\n      /      \\\n    H2C5        C3==C4\n              |    |\n              Me   Me\n    ```\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**3. Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. In this case, it's a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n*   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the ***endo*** product and the ***exo*** product.\n    *   The **endo rule** states that the kinetically favored product is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride part) are oriented under the newly forming pi system of the diene. This is the ***endo*** **adduct**.\n    *   The ***exo*** **adduct** is sterically less hindered and is the thermodynamically favored product.\n    *   The problem states a **major** and a **minor** product are formed. In most Diels-Alder reactions under kinetic control, the ***endo*** **product is major** and the ***exo*** **product is minor**.\n\n*   **Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The product is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's analyze the key proton groups in the product. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_alk):** Two methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. They are equivalent. **Signal: 6H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Two methyl groups on the C1 and C4 bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent. **Signal: 6H singlet**.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (H_anhyd):** Two protons on C5 and C6, where the anhydride is fused. They are equivalent. **Signal: 2H singlet**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They will give two separate signals, likely complex multiplets or doublets.\n\n**4. Analyze the NOESY Spectra**\n\n*   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent/weak in the minor product**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *exo* adduct (minor).\n\n*   **Spatial Relationships in the Isomers:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring (with H_anhyd) is tucked *under* the C2=C3 double bond. This brings the **H_anhyd** protons very close to the **vinylic methyls (Me_alk)**.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge, pointing *away* from the C2=C3 double bond. In this arrangement, the **H_anhyd** protons are far from the **Me_alk** groups.\n\n*   **Conclusion from NOESY:** The cross-peak that is unique to the major product must be between the **anhydride protons (H_anhyd)** and the **vinylic methyls (Me_alk)**.\n\n**5. Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option**\n\n*   Now we need to match these proton types to the chemical shifts and integrals given in the options.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls (Me_alk):** Methyl groups on a double bond typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the best match.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_anhyd):** These protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained bicyclic system. They are significantly deshielded. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is a very reasonable assignment.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls (Me_bh):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons. They are more shielded. The **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** is a good fit.\n    *   **Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** Protons on the methylene bridge. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these.\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak connects the vinylic methyls (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm) and the anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n\n*   This corresponds to option **B**.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and H_bridge (~1.5 ppm): Their spatial relationship is similar in both isomers.\n*   C) Me_bh (~1 ppm) and Me_alk (~1.7 ppm): Their spatial relationship is similar in both isomers.\n*   D) H_bridge (~1.5 ppm) and H_anhyd (~3.5 ppm): These protons are close in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the only logical answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants**: Use the provided information (dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, dehydration, NMR data) to deduce the structure of the anhydride (the dienophile). The diene is explicitly named.\n2.  **Determine the products**: Draw the structures of the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products from the Diels-Alder reaction between the identified diene and dienophile.\n3.  **Analyze spatial proximity**: Compare the 3D structures of the *endo* and *exo* products to find a pair of protons that are close in space (< 5 Å) in the major (*endo*) product but far apart in the minor (*exo*) product. This proximity will cause the unique NOESY cross-peak.\n4.  **Assign NMR signals**: Match the proton signals described in the answer choices (e.g., 6H singlet at ~1 ppm) to the specific protons in the product structure based on chemical environment, integration, and multiplicity.\n5.  **Combine and conclude**: Combine the spatial analysis from step 3 with the signal assignments from step 4 to identify the two resonances connected by the cross-peak and select the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n*   **Dienophile**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The simplest such acid is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride.\n    *   The NMR data for the anhydride confirms this:\n        *   ¹H NMR: Maleic anhydride is symmetrical, so the two alkene protons are equivalent, giving a single peak (given as 7 ppm).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: There are two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons, giving two peaks (given as 137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene**: The problem states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**Step 2 & 3: Determine Products and Analyze Spatial Proximity**\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. This reaction typically forms a major *endo* product (kinetic control) and a minor *exo* product (thermodynamic control). The key difference for NOESY analysis is the relative orientation of the anhydride ring and the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n\n*   **Major (Endo) Product**: The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are spatially close to the *anti*-proton on the C7 bridge (the bridge proton pointing towards the anhydride).\n*   **Minor (Exo) Product**: The anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. Here, the H_anhydride protons are far away from the C7 bridge protons.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the H_anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n**Step 4: Assign NMR Signals**\nNow, let's assign the signals given in the options to the protons in the product structure.\n\n*   **Protons in the product**:\n    *   Two equivalent protons from the original maleic anhydride (H_anhydride).\n    *   Two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge.\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinyl methyls).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n*   **Signal Assignments**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent **H_anhydride** protons. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, hence their downfield shift. They are a singlet due to symmetry.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is one of the **C7 bridge protons**. The two bridge protons are non-equivalent and split each other into doublets (geminal coupling). A shift of ~1.5 ppm is typical for such an aliphatic proton.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent **vinyl methyl groups**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent **bridgehead methyl groups**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine and Conclude**\nFrom our analysis, the unique NOESY cross-peak in the major product connects the H_anhydride protons with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n\n*   H_anhydride protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   A C7 bridge proton corresponds to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nThe cross-peak is between these two signals. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Breakdown of the Reaction and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n2.  **Product Formation**: This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n3.  **The \"Endo Rule\"**: In most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This preference is due to a stabilizing interaction between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n4.  **Identifying Endo vs. Exo**:\n    *   In the context of a cyclopentadiene diene, the bicyclic product has a one-carbon bridge (C7).\n    *   The **endo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the larger six-membered ring, on the opposite side of the one-carbon bridge. This places the anhydride protons close to the vinyl methyl groups on the newly formed double bond.\n    *   The **exo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side as the one-carbon bridge, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups.\n\n### Analyzing the NMR Data\n\n*   **Product Structure**: The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry, the molecule has:\n    *   Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion (H-5 and H-6).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinyl methyls).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (bridgehead methyls).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signals**:\n    *   The two anhydride protons (H-5, H-6) are adjacent to carbonyl groups and are in a rigid bicyclic system. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The six protons of the two vinyl methyl groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The six protons of the two bridgehead methyl groups are also equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**, but at a more shielded (lower) chemical shift, likely around ~1.0-1.2 ppm.\n\n*   **2D NOESY Spectrum**: This technique shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This key difference allows us to identify the major product's stereochemistry.\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups, so this cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\nBased on the typical chemical shifts:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to the anhydride protons.\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the vinyl methyl protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR spectrum. This spectroscopic data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, leading to a single ¹H peak, and by symmetry, there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   Two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. According to the Alder endo rule, the **endo adduct is the major product** (formed faster, kinetic control), and the **exo adduct is the minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Structure and Proton Assignments of the Products:**\n    Let's analyze the protons in the resulting bicyclic structure and assign the signals given in the options:\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_C):** These are the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring fused to the main frame. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent. They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so they will be downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to these protons.\n    *   **Alkene Methyl Protons (Me_alkene):** These are the four methyl groups from the C1, C2, C3, and C4 positions of the diene. In the product, two are on the new C=C double bond, and two are at the bridgehead carbons. The methyl groups on the double bond (vinylic methyls) are less shielded than those on saturated carbons. The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Me_bridgehead):** The **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm** corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead carbons.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** This is the former C5-CH₂ group of the diene, which now forms the C7 bridge of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system. The two protons are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are coupled to each other, so they should appear as two doublets. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these protons.\n\n4.  **NOESY Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). We need to find which pair of protons has this relationship.\n\n    *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the larger ring system.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_C, ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_C, ~3.5 ppm) are also close to the *syn* proton of the C7 methylene bridge (one of the protons around ~1.5 ppm).\n        *   Therefore, in the *endo* isomer, we expect to see NOE cross-peaks for both **(H_C ↔ Me_alkene)** and **(H_C ↔ H_bridge-syn)**.\n\n    *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the larger ring system.\n        *   The anhydride protons (H_C, ~3.5 ppm) are now far from the alkene methyl groups (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm) and the C7 bridge protons.\n        *   Instead, they are now close to the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead, ~1.0 ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peaks for **(H_C ↔ Me_alkene)** and **(H_C ↔ H_bridge-syn)** will be absent or very weak.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_C). This interaction is strong in the major (*endo*) product and weak/absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This is a possible answer.\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers, so this peak would not distinguish them.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H_bridge). The distance between these groups is similar in both isomers.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_alkene) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_C). This interaction is strong in the major (*endo*) product and weak/absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This is also a possible answer.\n\n6.  **Choosing Between A and D:**\n    Both options A and D describe NOE correlations that correctly identify the major (*endo*) isomer. However, we must choose the best description. The intensity of a NOESY cross-peak is proportional to the number of protons involved and inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between them (1/r⁶).\n    *   Interaction A is between a 2H signal and a 1H signal.\n    *   Interaction D is between a 2H signal and a 6H signal.\n\n    Assuming the distances are comparably short in the *endo* adduct (which they are), the cross-peak for interaction D will be significantly more intense because it involves a larger number of protons (a 6H singlet vs. a 1H doublet). This strong, prominent cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl groups is a classic and unambiguous indicator of the *endo* stereochemistry in this type of adduct. It is very likely \"the\" cross-peak the question refers to.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connecting the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, meaning all its protons are chemically equivalent. The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The two equivalent protons on the double bond give the single ¹H NMR peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene, two carbonyl) give the two ¹³C NMR peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This molecule has a five-membered ring with double bonds between carbons 1-2 and 3-4, methyl groups on each of these four carbons, and a CH₂ group at carbon 5.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction typically produces two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the **major product** under kinetic control. The *exo* product is thermodynamically more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Structure and ¹H NMR Assignments of Products:**\n    The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework. We can predict the approximate ¹H NMR signals based on the structure:\n    *   **Vinylic Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the double bond of the new six-membered ring. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. This gives a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are at the bridgehead carbons (carbons where the rings are fused). They are also equivalent. This gives a **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** The two protons from the original maleic anhydride are now part of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent and adjacent to the carbonyl groups. This gives a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons from the CH₂ group of the diene now form the one-carbon bridge (C7). They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). One is *syn* (closer to the double bond) and the other is *anti* (further from the double bond). They will appear as two distinct signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. One of these is the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Analysis:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak that is present in the **major (*endo*) product** but absent or weak in the **minor (*exo*) product**.\n\n5.  **Spatial Relationships in Endo vs. Exo Isomers:**\n    *   ***Endo* Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the main bicyclic framework, on the same side as the one-carbon bridge. In this orientation, the **anhydride protons** are spatially close to the ***anti* bridge proton**.\n    *   ***Exo* Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the one-carbon bridge. In this orientation, the **anhydride protons** are far from the *anti* bridge proton but are close to the *syn* bridge proton and the vinylic methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H):** These protons are relatively close in both isomers. This cross-peak would not be unique to the major product.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me):** These groups are far apart in both isomers. No significant cross-peak is expected.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Vinylic Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H):** This proximity exists in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) product. This is the opposite of what is described.\n    *   **D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridge H) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Anhydride H):**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons are close to the *anti* bridge proton. This will produce a NOESY cross-peak.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the *anti* bridge proton (they are close to the *syn* proton instead).\n        *   Therefore, a cross-peak connecting the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and one specific bridge proton (~1.5 ppm, which must be the *anti* proton) will be present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum.\n\nThis analysis matches the experimental observation described in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a multi-step chemical puzzle that can be solved by identifying the reactants, predicting the reaction products, and using the principles of 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm (alkene protons), and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The *cis* configuration is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic compound.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* product.\n    *   According to the \"endo rule,\" the major product of a kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reaction is typically the **endo isomer**. This is because of a stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The minor product is the **exo isomer**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major (Endo) and Minor (Exo) Products:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In this isomer, the anhydride portion of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In this isomer, the anhydride portion points \"away\" from the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n4.  **Apply NOESY Spectroscopy Principles:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NMR Data and NOESY Cross-Peaks:**\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product and their expected NMR signals. Due to a plane of symmetry in the product, we expect:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the five-membered anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system, so their signal will be downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are no longer all equivalent. The two methyl groups attached to the remaining double bond are equivalent to each other. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are also equivalent to each other. Being on saturated carbons, they are more shielded (upfield). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are not equivalent and would appear as two 1H signals, likely doublets. One is mentioned as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) are tucked underneath the bicyclic system. This position brings them very close to the vinyl methyl groups (6H at ~1.7 ppm) which are also on the \"bottom\" face of the molecule.\n        *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride protons are on the \"top\" face of the molecule, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups. The distance between them is large.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** A strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons is expected for the major (*endo*) product, while this cross-peak would be absent or very weak for the minor (*exo*) product. This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\nThe two resonances connected by this cross-peak are therefore the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis correctly identifies the reactants as maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. Due to significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the *exo* isomer is the major product, while the *endo* isomer is the minor product.\n\nIn the major (*exo*) product, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicyclic system. This spatial arrangement brings the two protons on the anhydride ring (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the six protons of the two methyl groups attached to the double bond (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). This proximity results in a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.\n\nIn the minor (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, far from these methyl groups, so this cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Therefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n### Breakdown of the Chemical Puzzle\n\n1.  **The Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to its anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is known to produce a bicyclic product. When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n4.  **The Products (Major and Minor):** The reaction yields a major and a minor product, which are the *endo* and *exo* isomers. According to the \"endo rule\" for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. This is due to a stabilizing secondary orbital interaction in the transition state. The minor product is the *exo* isomer, which is often more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly.\n\n    *   **Structure:** The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n        *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge.\n        *   The four methyl groups are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   The maleic anhydride part forms a fused ring at positions C2 and C3. The two protons from the anhydride are now attached to C2 and C3.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the C5-C6 double bond. In this arrangement, the two protons on the anhydride portion (Hₐ) point away from the double bond and towards the C7 methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5-C6 double bond. Here, the Hₐ protons point towards the C5-C6 double bond.\n\n5.  **NMR Analysis and the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This allows us to distinguish the isomers.\n    *   **Proton Signal Assignments (based on typical chemical shifts):**\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons (Hₐ) on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the C5-C6 double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal corresponds to one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Specifically, it is the *syn* proton (Hₛᵧₙ), which is shielded by the π-electron cloud of the nearby C5-C6 double bond, causing it to appear at a higher field (lower ppm) than its partner. It appears as a doublet due to coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n    *   **Identifying the Crucial NOE:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons (Hₐ, ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (Hₛᵧₙ, ~1.5 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons (Hₐ, ~3.5 ppm) are far from the C7 bridge protons but are close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). A cross-peak would be expected between the signals at ~3.5 ppm and ~1.7 ppm for this isomer.\n\nSince the unique cross-peak is observed in the **major product**, it must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the *syn*-methylene bridge proton. This corresponds to the resonances at approximately 3.5 ppm (a 2H singlet) and 1.5 ppm (a 1H doublet).\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Incorrect. These protons are far apart.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Incorrect. This cross-peak would be characteristic of the *minor* product.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** **Correct.** This describes the interaction between the *syn*-C7 proton and the anhydride protons in the major *endo* adduct.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Incorrect. These methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring system and are not close enough for a significant NOE.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **Proposer:** The problem describes a Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The reaction produces two stereoisomers, a major and a minor product. These are the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The key to solving the problem is to identify the major product and then determine which protons are close enough in space to produce a NOESY cross-peak. Based on the symmetry of the reactants, the product will have a plane of symmetry, leading to three distinct proton signals: a 2H singlet for the protons on the anhydride ring (let's call them H_anhydride), a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (Me_vinylic), and a 6H singlet for the two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated carbons (Me_alkyl). Based on typical chemical shifts, H_anhydride would be around 3.5 ppm, Me_vinylic around 1.7 ppm, and Me_alkyl around 1.0 ppm. The Alder-endo rule predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major kinetic product. In the *endo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons are spatially close to the Me_alkyl protons. This would predict a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm. However, this is not among the options. I propose that due to the significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the Alder-endo rule is reversed, and the *exo* adduct is the major product. In the *exo* adduct, the H_anhydride protons are close to the Me_vinylic protons. This would result in a cross-peak between the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This corresponds to option A. My proposed action is to search for evidence that Diels-Alder reactions with heavily substituted dienes can favor the *exo* product.\n\n*   **Skeptic:** Your hypothesis that steric hindrance reverses the normal *endo* selectivity is plausible. The four methyl groups on the diene create a very crowded environment, and the *exo* transition state would likely be less sterically hindered than the *endo* transition state. Your assignment of chemical shifts also seems reasonable. If your hypothesis is correct, then Option A is the logical answer. The search results confirm that while the *endo* product is the kinetic product in the classic cyclopentadiene + maleic anhydride reaction, the rule is not absolute and can be reversed by other factors, including steric hindrance. The search results also confirm the expected spatial relationships for NOESY analysis in *endo* and *exo* isomers. Although no direct example for 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene was found, the principle that severe steric hindrance can override the electronic preference for the *endo* product is well-established. Therefore, the conclusion that the *exo* product is major in this case is the most logical explanation that fits the provided options.\n\n*   **Decision:** The debate converges on the conclusion that steric hindrance makes the *exo* adduct the major product. In the *exo* isomer, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm, 2H singlet) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm, 6H singlet). This proximity will create a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
