    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core concept**: The question is about the Mott-Gurney equation, which describes Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). The fundamental idea behind SCLC is that when you inject a large number of charge carriers into an insulator or semiconductor, these carriers themselves (the \"space charge\") limit the flow of more carriers. The current is not limited by the material's intrinsic conductivity or the ability of the contact to inject carriers, but by this space charge repulsion within the bulk of the material.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Mott-Gurney Equation**:\n    $ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\n    *   The equation shows that current (J) is driven by Voltage (V). The mechanism for charges moving under a voltage-induced electric field is **drift**. Therefore, **drift current must be dominant**, and any statement suggesting negligible drift current is incorrect.\n    *   The equation includes mobility ($\\mu$) for a single type of carrier. This implies the model is developed for a **single-carrier device**.\n    *   The proportionality constant ($\\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu$) does not contain any terms related to charge traps. This specific form of the equation is the simplest case and assumes a **trap-free** material. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, and the J-V relationship would be different (often with a voltage exponent greater than 2 in certain regimes, as described by the Mark-Helfrich law).\n    *   The model assumes that the injecting contact can supply as many carriers as needed to build up the space charge. This means there is no energy barrier to injection. This type of contact is called an **Ohmic contact** or is described as having **no carrier injection barrier**. This is a crucial condition; if the contact were injection-limited (like a Schottky contact), the physics would be governed by the contact, not the bulk space charge.\n    *   The derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation starts from the Poisson equation and the drift current equation, explicitly **neglecting the diffusion current component**. This is a valid approximation when the applied voltage is sufficiently high.\n\n3.  **Evaluate each option based on the deconstruction**:\n\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   *Incorrect*. The standard Mott-Gurney law is derived for a **single-carrier** (unipolar) device.\n\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   *Correct*. This statement accurately lists the key assumptions:\n            *   **Trap-free**: Matches the simple $V^2$ form.\n            *   **Single-carrier**: Matches the unipolar nature of the derivation.\n            *   **No carrier injection barrier**: This is the definition of the ideal Ohmic contact needed for SCLC.\n            *   **Negligible diffusion current**: Matches the assumption that drift current dominates.\n\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n        *   *Incorrect*. SCLC is fundamentally a **drift-dominated** current. Negligible drift current contradicts the entire physical basis of the phenomenon.\n\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n        *   *Incorrect*. A **Schottky contact** is a rectifying contact that creates an energy barrier for charge injection. This would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current. The Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier) that can supply an abundance of carriers.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: Option B is the only one that correctly combines all the necessary conditions for the validity of the simple Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
