    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents performs an alpha-bromination reaction on the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. One of the alpha-hydrogens on the methyl group of acetic acid is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile that displaces the bromide leaving group in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a tandem alkylation-cyclization reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (an enolate). The protons on the carbon between the cyano and ester groups are particularly acidic.\n        [NC-CH(-)-COOEt]⁻Na⁺\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane chain, displacing a bromide ion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic alpha-proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        [NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻Na⁺\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The carbanion now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, displacing the second bromide and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate. We assume rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature.\n\nThe molecule's structure is a cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and a -COOCH2CH3 group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **-OCH2-:** These two methylene protons are adjacent to the ester's oxygen atom, which is bonded to the prochiral C1 carbon of the ring. The complex and bulky environment at C1 can restrict rotation or create asymmetry, making these two protons chemically different (diastereotopic). This results in **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 protons total):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Assuming rapid chair-flipping, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester linkage. This means C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6 (4H):** The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation). The same is true for the protons on C6. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two \"upper\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" protons are also equivalent. This gives **2 signals** for these four protons.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5 (4H):** The reasoning is the same as for C2/C6. The four protons give rise to **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4 (2H):** The two protons on C4 are interchanged by reflection through the molecule's plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons have the same chemical shift. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   Ethyl group: 1 (for -CH3) + 2 (for -OCH2-) = 3 signals\n*   Cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 1 (for C4) = 5 signals\n*   **Total = 3 + 5 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<B>>>"
