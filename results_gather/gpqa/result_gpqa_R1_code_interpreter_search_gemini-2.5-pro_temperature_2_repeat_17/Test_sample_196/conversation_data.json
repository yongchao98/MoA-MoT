    "**1. Deconstruct the Input Data to Identify Compound X**\n\n*   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The broad peak from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The sharp, strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded (shifted downfield). The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (The substituent at the para-position):**\n        *   We have four signals left for this group: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) group. Its downfield shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methine group (the -CH- at 2.9 ppm). This forms a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is the methylene (-CH₂-) group. It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm (which makes the methyl group a triplet) and the methine group at 2.9 ppm. This forms a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **Putting it all together:** The benzylic carbon (-CH- at 2.9 ppm) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃ at 1.4 ppm) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃ at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm). This complete structure is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (Red P) and Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl groups, including those in carboxylic acids, down to methylene (-CH₂-) or methyl (-CH₃) groups. It is a more potent version of the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring itself will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: The -COOH group is replaced by a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product Name: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**3. Match with Options**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted final product.\n*   B) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is structurally incorrect.\n*   C) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** The starting material contains a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group. No rearrangement would occur.\n*   D) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
