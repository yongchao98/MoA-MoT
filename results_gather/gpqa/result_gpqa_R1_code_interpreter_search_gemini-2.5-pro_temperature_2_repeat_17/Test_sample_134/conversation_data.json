    "The problem asks for the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of $m_X = 6$ GeV. The interaction Lagrangian that describes the coupling of the boson X to fermions is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left(y\\right)=-\\lambda{f}\\bar{\\psi}{f}\\left(y\\right)\\left(\\upsilon+X\\left(y\\right)\\right)\\psi_{f}\\left(y\\right) $$\nThis Lagrangian can be expanded into two parts:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(y) = -\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\nThe first term, $-\\lambda_f \\upsilon \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, is the mass term for the fermion $f$. By comparing this to the standard mass term in the Lagrangian, $-m_f \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, we can identify the mass of the fermion $f$ as $m_f = \\lambda_f \\upsilon$.\n\nThe second term, $-\\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$, describes the interaction between the boson X and a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction term allows for the decay of the boson X into a fermion $f$ and its corresponding antifermion $\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay process to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the final state particles. In this case, for the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$:\n$$ m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}} $$\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$$ m_X > 2m_f $$\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV, the condition for a kinematically allowed decay is:\n$$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f $$\n$$ m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nThis means that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than 3 GeV. We need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to determine which decays are allowed.\n\n**Quark Masses:**\n*   Up quark (u): $m_u \\approx 2.2$ MeV = 0.0022 GeV. Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n*   Down quark (d): $m_d \\approx 4.7$ MeV = 0.0047 GeV. Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is allowed.\n*   Strange quark (s): $m_s \\approx 95$ MeV = 0.095 GeV. Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed.\n*   Charm quark (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV. Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   Bottom quark (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** allowed.\n*   Top quark (t): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** allowed.\n\n**Lepton Masses:**\n*   Electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.511$ MeV = 0.000511 GeV. Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7$ MeV = 0.1057 GeV. Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV. Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   Neutrinos ($\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$): Neutrinos have very small but non-zero masses, all well below the 3 GeV threshold. Thus, decays to neutrino-antineutrino pairs are kinematically allowed. However, these channels are not listed in the options provided, and in many models extending the Standard Model, the coupling to neutrinos is assumed to be negligible or zero. We will focus on the charged fermions listed in the options.\n\nCombining the allowed decay channels for charged fermions, we get:\n$X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$\n\nNow, we compare this list with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes forbidden $t\\bar{t}$ decay)\nB) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ decay and omits allowed $c\\bar{c}$ decay)\nC) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ decay and omits allowed $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays)\nD) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct, this list exactly matches our derived set of allowed decays)\n\n<<<D>>>"
