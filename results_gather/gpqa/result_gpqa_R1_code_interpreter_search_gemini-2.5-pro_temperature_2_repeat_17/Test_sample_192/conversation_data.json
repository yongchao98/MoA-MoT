    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given an empirical relationship for the number of stars, `N`, in a specific region of the sky. This number varies with the stellar parallax, `plx`. The relationship is given as `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, `r`, depends on that distance. This quantity is the differential number count, mathematically represented as `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   Stellar parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. For small angles, it is inversely proportional to the distance.\n    *   The standard formula is `r = 1/plx`, where if `plx` is in arcseconds, `r` is in parsecs. This means `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Relation:**\n    *   The statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" needs interpretation. In astronomy, star counts are often expressed as a cumulative number, i.e., the total number of stars satisfying a certain criterion (e.g., brighter than a certain magnitude, or closer than a certain distance).\n    *   A classic result for a uniform distribution of stars in space is that the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r` is `N(<r) ∝ r^3`. Using the relation `r ∝ 1/plx`, this becomes `N(>plx) ∝ (1/plx)^3`.\n    *   The problem gives a similar power-law relationship, `N ∝ 1/plx^5`. It is most likely that this `N` also refers to a cumulative count. Specifically, `N(>plx)` would be the total number of stars observed with a parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n    *   So, we interpret the given relation as `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n4.  **Translate the Relation to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the number of stars as a function of distance `r`.\n    *   `N(>plx)` represents the number of stars with parallax `p ≥ plx`. Since `r = 1/plx`, this corresponds to stars with distance `d ≤ r`. So, `N(>plx)` is the same as `N(<r)`, the cumulative number of stars within distance `r`.\n    *   Now substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the given relation:\n        `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n        `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at distance `r` with thickness `dr`, divided by `dr`. This is precisely the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   We need to calculate `dN/dr`.\n    *   We have the proportionality `N(<r) ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`: `N(<r) = k * r^5`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n        `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n    *   This result shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   So, `dN/dr ∝ r^4`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The derived relationship `dN/dr ∝ r^4` corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
