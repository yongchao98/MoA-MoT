    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Such compounds are called meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The IUPAC name provides specific stereochemical descriptors: (3aR, 7aS) for stereocenters and (E) for the double bond geometry.\n    *   The naming of a specific stereoisomer with R/S and E/Z notation indicates that we are dealing with a single, defined isomer.\n    *   A specific stereoisomer is optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound. A meso compound must have internal symmetry. While the core structure might possess symmetry, the combination of multiple stereocenters (`3aR,7aS`) and an unsymmetrically placed substituent (`(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`) makes it extremely unlikely for the molecule as a whole to possess a plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the rest of the molecule).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the (R,S) and (S,R) combination results in a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it achiral despite having chiral centers. This can be visualized in a Newman projection which shows a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is a meso compound, which is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso form discussed above.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Since (2R,3R) is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   Carbon-1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH2-CH=CH- (path around the ring one way), and -CH2-CH2-CH= (path around the ring the other way).\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This nomenclature usually refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The all-cis isomer can have all three OH groups in axial positions or all three in equatorial positions.\n    *   In either conformation, the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry (Ïƒv) that pass through each C-OH bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. No carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. For example, C3 of the butanoyl chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule also has no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the C=O group and can be aligned with symmetry planes within the isobutyl and cyclopentyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active: #2, #4, #5\n*   Not optically active: #1, #3, #6, #7\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>"
