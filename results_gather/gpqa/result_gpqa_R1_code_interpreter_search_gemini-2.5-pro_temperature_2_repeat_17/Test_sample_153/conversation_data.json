    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes. So, the molecular weight (MW) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The intensity ratio of the M+ peak (m/z=156) to the M+2 peak (m/z=158) is 100:32, or approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a classic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n    *   The peak at m/z=156 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁵Cl isotope.\n    *   The peak at m/z=158 corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the very broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the molecule is a **carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly diagnostic for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** It is a singlet, meaning it is not coupled to any adjacent protons, which is typical for an acidic proton that rapidly exchanges.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It represents one proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8.5 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity & Integration:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts arise because the two substituents on the ring are different, making the two sets of protons (those ortho to substituent 1, and those ortho to substituent 2) chemically non-equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NMR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### **4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The compound contains one **chlorine** atom.\n*   It has a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **para (1,4)** arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde/phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Its NMR would show an aldehyde proton (~10 ppm) and a phenolic proton, and the aromatic splitting pattern would be more complex (not two doublets). **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate. It lacks the O-H group for the broad IR peak and the acidic proton in the NMR. Its C=O stretch in the IR would be at a much higher frequency (~1780 cm⁻¹). **Incorrect.**\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular ion (with ³⁵Cl) of 156. **Correct.**\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid. **Correct.**\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a para-disubstituted benzene ring, which gives the characteristic two-doublet NMR pattern. **Correct.**\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, its ortho-substitution pattern would result in a more complex multiplet for the 4 aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets. **Incorrect.**\n\nTherefore, the only plausible structure for the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
