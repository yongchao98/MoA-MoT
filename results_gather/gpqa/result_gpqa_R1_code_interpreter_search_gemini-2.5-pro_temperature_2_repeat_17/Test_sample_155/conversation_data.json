    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2       H\n              \\     /\n               C = C\n              /     \\\n             H       CH3CH2CH2\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This is a peroxy acid that performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition across the double bond. Since the starting alkene is trans, epoxidation from either face of the double bond will result in a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen (backside attack). This results in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to an anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemistry of such reactions on symmetrical alkenes: **Anti-addition to an E (trans)-alkene results in a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this. Starting with the racemic epoxide mixture:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. These are two names for the same meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Attack at C4 (inversion) gives (4R,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 (inversion) gives (4S,5R)-diol. Again, this is the same meso compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH3CH2CH2\n              \\     /\n               C = C\n              /     \\\n             H       H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), resulting in an anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for this case is: **Anti-addition to a Z (cis)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Let's verify this. The intermediate from mCPBA is the meso-epoxide, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   meso-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → The two carbons of the epoxide (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic. Attack at one carbon gives one enantiomer of the diol, and attack at the other gives the other enantiomer.\n        *   Attack at C4 leads to the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 leads to the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nRelationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe problem assumes theoretically perfect resolution.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral chromatography separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will have different retention times, so they can be separated. The meso-diol will separate from the other two.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   This results in a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The enantiomers form temporary diastereomeric complexes with the chiral phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture can be separated from each other.\n    *   The chromatogram will show:\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   This results in a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard (achiral) HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
