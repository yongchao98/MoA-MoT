    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial for determining the correct order of reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which often sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe question asks for a high-yield synthesis starting from benzene. This implies that each step should proceed with high regioselectivity, favoring one major product. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the lone pair of the amino group acts as a Lewis base and coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n*   The numbering and order of reagents seem garbled. For example, `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is listed before `Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine, which is required for diazotization). A valid reaction sequence cannot have diazotization before the amine is formed. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ... vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on a diazonium salt ...**\n*   Let's trace the first few steps:\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the bulky t-Bu group directs para).\n    *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (both groups direct to this position).\n    *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → Diazonium salt.\n    *   vi) Reaction of the diazonium salt with HNO₃/H₂SO₄. This is not a standard, recognized reaction for transforming a diazonium group. Sandmeyer reactions (e.g., using CuNO₂) are used to replace the diazonium group with -NO₂, not reaction with the nitrating mixture itself. This step is chemically invalid. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n*   This sequence is the only one remaining. Let's analyze it step-by-step, assuming we proceed with the major product at each stage to ensure a \"high-yield\" path.\n\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **Step ii: tert-Butylbenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the para product is formed in much higher yield (~75-85%) than the ortho product. We proceed with the major isomer, **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    *   **Step iii: p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → p-tert-butylaniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n\n    *   **Step iv: p-tert-butylaniline + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director.\n        *   The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 directs incoming electrophiles to C3 and C5.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs incoming electrophiles to C2 and C6 (which are equivalent to C3 and C5 relative to the -NH₃⁺ group).\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the tert-butyl group. This reaction is highly regioselective and gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** as the major product.\n\n    *   **Step v: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO₂/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride.** Standard diazotization of the primary amino group.\n\n    *   **Step vi: Diazonium salt + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid.\n\n    *   **Step vii: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace bromide from ethyl bromide.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Option A:** This sequence of reactions (i-vii) is chemically sound, and each step produces a single major product in high yield. The reagents `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄` are extraneous to this main pathway. The final product of this synthesis is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which has a 1,2,4 substitution pattern.\n\n**Final Consideration**\nThe target molecule was named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,3-substituted isomer. However, none of the provided reaction sequences can produce this isomer in high yield. The sequence in Option A is the only one that is chemically viable from start to finish with high regioselectivity, and it produces the 1,2,4-isomer. It is highly probable that the name of the target compound in the question prompt contains a typo, and the question is actually asking for the synthesis of the 1,2,4 isomer. Based on the analysis of the options, sequence A represents the only logical and high-yield synthesis possible with the given reagents.\n\n<<<A>>>"
