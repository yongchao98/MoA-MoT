    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I'll first break down the information provided in the question.\n    *   **System:** Two stars, star_1 and star_2.\n    *   **Observation:** We are looking at the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of these stars.\n    *   **Key Relationship:** The number of excited iron atoms (in a specific energy level) in star_1 is twice the number in star_2. Let's denote the number of atoms in the excited state as `N_excited` and in the ground state as `N_ground`. The term \"twice as excited\" implies that the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms is twice as large in star_1 as in star_2.\n        *   So, `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2`.\n    *   **Energy Value:** The energy difference between the ground state and the excited state is `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    *   **Assumption:** The stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a crucial piece of information, as it allows me to use statistical mechanics equations like the Boltzmann equation.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars, `T_1` and `T_2`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principle:** The assumption of LTE immediately points to the **Boltzmann equation**. This equation relates the population of different energy levels of an atom to the temperature of the system. The Boltzmann equation is:\n\n    `N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k_B * T))`\n\n    where:\n    *   `N_i` and `N_j` are the number of atoms in energy states `i` (excited) and `j` (ground), respectively.\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of those states.\n    *   `E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states, which is our `ΔE`.\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star:**\n\n    *   **For star_1 (temperature T_1):**\n        `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))`\n\n    *   **For star_2 (temperature T_2):**\n        `(N_excited / N_ground)_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n    Note that `g_excited`, `g_ground`, `ΔE`, and `k_B` are constants that are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations using the Given Ratio:**\n    The problem states `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2`. I can rewrite this as:\n\n    `(N_excited / N_ground)_1 / (N_excited / N_ground)_2 = 2`\n\n    Now, I'll substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this ratio:\n\n    `[ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ] = 2`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n\n    *   The statistical weight term `(g_excited / g_ground)` cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n        `exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) = 2`\n\n    *   Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n        `exp[ (-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ] = 2`\n        `exp[ (ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) ] = 2`\n\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k_B`:\n        `exp[ (ΔE / k_B) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2`\n\n6.  **Isolate the Temperatures:**\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides to remove the `exp`:\n        `ln(2) = (ΔE / k_B) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n        `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    *   Substitute this back into the equation:\n        `ln(2) = (ΔE / k_B) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Constant Factor `(ΔE / k_B)`:**\n    The problem gives specific values for `ΔE` and implies we should use the known value of the Boltzmann constant `k_B`.\n\n    *   `ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   `k_B ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\n    The values given seem intentionally chosen to make their ratio simple. Let's calculate it. I'll use Python to be precise.\n    ```python\n    delta_E = 1.38e-23  # Joules\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23 # Joules per Kelvin\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio\n    ratio = delta_E / k_B\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    0.9995300007460037\n    ```\n    The ratio is extremely close to 1. The numbers were clearly chosen so that `ΔE / k_B ≈ 1 K`.\n\n8.  **Finalize the Equation:**\n    Substituting `ΔE / k_B = 1` into my derived equation:\n\n    `ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Now I compare this final result with the multiple-choice options.\n\n    *   A) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n    *   B) `ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]`\n    *   C) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]`\n    *   D) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\n    My derived equation exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
