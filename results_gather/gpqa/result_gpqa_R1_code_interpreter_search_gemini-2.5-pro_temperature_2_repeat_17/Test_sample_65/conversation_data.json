    "*   **Analyze the problem:** The question asks which fundamental symmetries are required to be preserved by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n*   **Deconstruct SMEFT:** SMEFT is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. It is an effective field theory, which means it describes physics at a certain energy scale (typically the electroweak scale) without specifying the underlying high-energy physics (the \"UV completion\"). The key assumption of SMEFT is that the new physics at high energies still respects the fundamental principles of quantum field theory and the gauge symmetries of the Standard Model.\n\n*   **Evaluate each symmetry:**\n\n    1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All known fundamental laws of physics are Lorentz-invariant. Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), which are the language of particle physics, are built upon the principle of Lorentz invariance. The SMEFT is a local QFT, and its operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, **Lorentz symmetry must be respected.** Models that violate Lorentz symmetry exist (like the Standard-Model Extension, or SME), but they are distinct from the standard construction of SMEFT.\n\n    2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, comprising Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational pillar of QFT. The action in QFT is required to be invariant under Poincare transformations. Thus, **Poincare symmetry must be respected** in SMEFT.\n\n    3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry (e.g., through a complex phase in the CKM matrix, responsible for CP violation in kaon and B-meson decays). SMEFT is designed to parametrize all possible new physics effects, including new sources of CP violation. Many dimension-6 operators in the SMEFT basis explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, **CP symmetry is not required to be respected** by all SMEFT operators.\n\n    4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result that states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is automatically symmetric under the combined transformation of C, P, and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must obey the CPT theorem. Therefore, **CPT symmetry must be respected.**\n\n*   **Synthesize the results:**\n    *   Symmetry 1 (Lorentz): Must be respected.\n    *   Symmetry 2 (Poincare): Must be respected.\n    *   Symmetry 3 (CP): Is not required to be respected.\n    *   Symmetry 4 (CPT): Must be respected.\n\n*   **Match with options:** The symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
