    "*   **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better target for observation. The final answer should be a comparison of these probabilities.\n\n*   **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit, this is:\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n*   **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`Prob_1`) to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (`Prob_2`).\n    `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    The ratio is:\n    `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\n*   **Incorporate Given Information into the Ratio:**\n    1.  We are told that both host stars have the same radius: `R_s1 = R_s2`. Let's call this `R_s`.\n    2.  Substituting this into the ratio formula simplifies it:\n        `Ratio = (R_s / a_1) / (R_s / a_2) = a_2 / a_1`\n    So, the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. To find this, we must relate the semi-major axes.\n\n*   **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law provides the relationship between a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The law states:\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s`\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_s`\n    `a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`):**\n    Using the proportionality from Kepler's Law, we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Substitute Known Relationships from the Problem Statement:**\n    1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n    2.  The mass of Star_1 is twice the mass of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / ((P_2 / 3)^2 * (2 * M_s2)) ]^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / ((P_2^2 / 9) * 2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)`\n    The `P_2^2` and `M_s2` terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ 9 / 2 ]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n*   **Compute the Final Value:** The ratio of the probabilities is equal to this value. We will use a calculator to find the cube root of 4.5.\n```python\nimport math\nratio = math.pow(4.5, 1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.650964024563816\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is approximately 1.65. This means that Planet_1 has a probability of transiting that is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since `Prob_1` is significantly higher than `Prob_2`, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its host star is proportional to the ratio of the stellar radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (P_transit ∝ R_star / a).\n\nWe want to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 (P1) to that of Planet_2 (P2). The ratio of their probabilities is:\n\nRatio = P1 / P2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)\n\nWhere:\n- R_s1 and R_s2 are the radii of the host stars.\n- a_1 and a_2 are the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the host stars have the same radii:\nR_s1 = R_s2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of probabilities simplifies to:\nRatio = a_2 / a_1\n\nTo find the relationship between the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law:\nP^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star\nRearranging for the semi-major axis (a), we get:\na^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star\na ∝ (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the planets' orbital periods (P) and their host stars' masses (M_star):\n\na_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / (P_1^2 * M_s1) ]^(1/3)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following relationships:\n- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P_1 = P_2 / 3.\n- The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2.\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / ( (P_2 / 3)^2 * (2 * M_s2) ) ]^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2^2 * M_s2) / ( (P_2^2 / 9) * 2 * M_s2 ) ]^(1/3)\n\nThe terms P_2^2 and M_s2 cancel out, leaving:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\na_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities (P1 / P2) is equal to this value. Calculating the cube root of 4.5:\n\n(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65\n\nSo, P1 / P2 ≈ 1.65. This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
