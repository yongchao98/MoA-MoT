    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The first critical clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    *   T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is characteristic of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Substance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is typical behavior for a metal hydroxide, which dehydrates upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. Since D₂O is released, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. The decomposition reaction is: M(OD)n (s) → Metal Oxide + D₂O (g). The fact that G is a precipitate narrows down the possibilities for the metal M.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's check common small molecules.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule D₂ has **2 protons and 2 neutrons** (Yes).\n        *   N₂: Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule N₂ has **14 protons and 14 neutrons** (Yes).\n        *   CO: C has 6p, 6n; O has 8p, 8n. The molecule CO has **14 protons and 14 neutrons** (Yes).\n    *   Given that the system clearly involves deuterium (from B = D₂O), the most plausible candidate for the gas W is **D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + G(s).\n    *   To produce D₂ gas, the deuterium atoms must come from the reactants. This points to a reaction between a deuteride donor (like a D⁻ source) and a deuterium acceptor (like a D⁺ source).\n    *   The classic violent reaction of this type is a metal hydride with water. To produce D₂ gas, a metal deuteride must react with a deuterated protic solvent, like D₂O.\n    *   Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction becomes: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → D₂ (W) + Metal Deuteroxide (G). This is a consistent and logical reaction pathway.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have more clues about X:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (we've established this is Deuterium, D).\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" (the non-deuterated version) is also used.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups must be reduced to alcohols (forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This requires a very strong reducing agent, as weaker ones (like sodium borohydride) would not reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   A very common, strong reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly. It's a strong reducing agent, its analog is common, it's a metal deuteride.\n    *   Let's check if it forms a precipitate. The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, as aluminium hydroxide is insoluble. Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and 3D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Identified by the lowest atomic number (Z). Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Identified by the highest atomic number. Aluminium (Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   The question states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes present (D=²H, so mass number = 2; Al=²⁷Al, so mass number = 27).\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 instances of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D).\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 instance of aluminium.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated for the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
