    "This question asks us to identify which of the four given mutations is most likely to inactivate a gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to inactivate a gene is to introduce a mutation that prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. We will read the DNA in groups of three (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon. We can use a standard codon table for translation.\n\n**1. Intact (Wild-Type) Gene Sequence:**\n\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine (Start) - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nThis is the sequence of the functional protein we want to disrupt.\n\n**2. Analyze Mutant 1:**\n\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... -3’\n*   **Comparison to Intact:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). There's also a silent mutation in the second codon (`TTT` to `TTC`, both code for Phenylalanine).\n*   **Resulting Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n*   **Type of Mutation:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid (Leucine) for another (Tyrosine). While this *might* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n**3. Analyze Mutant 2:**\n\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT... -3’\n*   **Comparison to Intact:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   **Resulting Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**.\n*   **Type of Mutation:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the cell's machinery to terminate protein synthesis. This mutation will result in a severely truncated protein that is only two amino acids long. A protein this short will be completely non-functional.\n\n**4. Analyze Mutant 3:**\n\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC... -3’\n*   **Comparison to Intact:** This sequence has two changes. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n*   **Resulting Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val**...\n*   **Type of Mutation:** These are two **missense mutations**. As with Mutant 1, these changes might inactivate the protein, but there is no guarantee.\n\n**5. Analyze Mutant 4:**\n\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT GCT ACT TCT... -3’\n*   **Comparison to Intact:** Comparing the sequence of Mutant 4 to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...`), we can see that the sequence `GGT` (the fifth codon) has been deleted.\n*   **Resulting Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Thr... (The Glycine is missing).\n*   **Type of Mutation:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of three nucleotides, which removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein. The reading frame for subsequent codons is preserved. Deleting an amino acid can be disruptive, but if it's from a non-critical part of the protein, the function might be retained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the four options, the **nonsense mutation** in **Mutant 2** is the most likely to result in a complete loss of function. By introducing a premature stop codon so early in the sequence, it prevents the synthesis of the vast majority of the protein, ensuring that the anti-nutritional compound cannot be produced. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) lead to less predictable outcomes and carry a higher risk of the protein retaining some or all of its function.\n\n<<<C>>>"
