    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem asks about a decay from the hydrogen atom state |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via a two-step dipole transition. This means there's a cascade decay involving an intermediate state.\n    The path is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{photon 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The \"dipole transition\" refers to the electric dipole (E1) transition, which is the most dominant type of transition.\n\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules for the First Transition:**\n    The selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n    For the first transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$) to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m'$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   For a decay (emission), the energy of the initial state must be higher than the final state. In the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, energy $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$. So we need $n' < 3$.\n    *   From the options provided, the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is consistent with $n'<3$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules for the Second Transition:**\n    Let's check if the transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$) is allowed.\n    *   For any intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (with $l'=1$):\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   For the change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$.\n        *   If $m'= -1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed. Path: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   If $m'= 0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed. Path: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   If $m'= 1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed. Path: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    All three routes are valid according to the selection rules. The options list these valid routes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that decay channel.\n    The total probability of the route is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n    $P(\\text{route via } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n    *   **Second Step:** The state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state) can only decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (1s) state via a single-photon E1 transition. All other transitions are forbidden or highly suppressed. Therefore, once the atom is in the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state, it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with a probability of 1. So, $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **First Step:** The probability now depends only on the branching ratio of the first transition. The probability of the atom taking the route via a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle)}$\n        where $\\Gamma$ is the transition rate.\n\n    *   The total decay rate from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state is the sum of the rates to the three possible intermediate states (as decay to other states like 1s is forbidden and M1/E2 transitions are negligible).\n        $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) + \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\n    *   The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle n',l',m'|\\mathbf{r}|n,l,m\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means the transition rates to each of the magnetic sublevels $m'$ of the final $l'=1$ state must be equal.\n    *   So, $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n    *   Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_0$. Then $\\Gamma_{total} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n    *   The probability for any one of these channels is $\\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability for any of the three possible decay routes is $1/3$.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n    *   Route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n    D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$  and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability and typo)\n\n    Option C provides a valid route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\nTo verify the equality of transition rates, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import S\n\n# According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the rates for the first transition,\n# |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m_prime>, are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan\n# coefficient <l,m; k,q | l',m'>^2 where l=0, m=0, k=1, l'=1, and q = m_prime.\n# The radial integral part of the matrix element is the same for all m_prime.\n\n# Calculate the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the three possible transitions\n# to m_prime = -1, 0, 1 (q = -1, 0, 1)\n\ncg_sq_minus_1 = CG(S(0), S(0), S(1), S(-1), S(1), S(-1)).doit()**2\ncg_sq_0 = CG(S(0), S(0), S(1), S(0), S(1), S(0)).doit()**2\ncg_sq_plus_1 = CG(S(0), S(0), S(1), S(1), S(1), S(1)).doit()**2\n\n# Since all three squared CG coefficients are equal to 1, the transition rates are equal.\n# The total rate is the sum of three equal rates.\n# So the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\nprob = 1/3\n\nprint(f\"Squared CG for q=-1: {cg_sq_minus_1}\")\nprint(f\"Squared CG for q=0: {cg_sq_0}\")\nprint(f\"Squared CG for q=+1: {cg_sq_plus_1}\")\nprint(f\"The rates for transitions to m'=-1, 0, 1 are proportional to the squared CGs, which are all equal.\")\nprint(f\"Thus, the probability for each channel is {prob}.\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state through a two-step electric dipole transition. This means the atom first decays to an intermediate state, which then decays to the final state.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nWe need to identify the allowed intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ and calculate the probability of that specific decay path.\n\n### Step 1: Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n1.  $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n3.  For emission, the energy of the initial state must be higher than the final state. In the hydrogen atom, energy depends on the principal quantum number $n$ as $E_n \\propto -1/n^2$, so $n$ must decrease for spontaneous emission.\n\n#### Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Applying energy conservation: $n'$ must be less than 3. The options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options in the question correctly identify an intermediate state with $n'=2, l'=1$.\n\n#### Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\nLet's check if a transition from our potential intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   Initial state (intermediate): $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n*   Final state: $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: $l_{final} - l_{initial} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: $m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0 - m'$. This value is $\\{-(-1), -0, -1\\} = \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, all of which are allowed.\n\nConclusion: All three pathways are allowed by the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe overall probability of a specific decay route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) is the only possible E1 decay route from the 2p state, so its probability is 1.\n\nWe need to calculate the relative probabilities of the three decay channels in the first step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate ($\\Gamma$) is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element: $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle n',l',m'|\\vec{r}|n,l,m\\rangle|^2$.\n\n**Symmetry Argument:**\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, when it decays, there is no reason to prefer one of the final magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) over the others. All three final states are equally likely.\n\nSince there are three possible and equally likely decay channels, the probability for any single channel is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Formal Argument (using Wigner-Eckart Theorem):**\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem separates the matrix element into a part that depends on the geometry (Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and a part that does not (reduced matrix element).\n$|\\langle 2,1,m'|\\vec{r}|3,0,0\\rangle|^2 \\propto |\\langle 0,0;1,m'|1,m'\\rangle|^2$\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0;1,q|1,q \\rangle$ is equal to 1 for all possible values of $q$.\nThis means the transition rate to each of the $m'=-1, 0, 1$ states is identical.\n\nLet the rate for one channel be $\\Gamma_0$. The total rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma_{m'} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\nThe probability (or branching ratio) for any one route is:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### Step 3: Match with the Options\nWe are looking for a valid route with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Probability is incorrect)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Probability is incorrect)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Route and probability are correct)\nD) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Typo in state, and probability is incorrect)\n\nOption C provides a valid decay path with the correct probability.\n\n<<<C>>>"
