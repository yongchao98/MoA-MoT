    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The \"7-oxa\" indicates the oxygen is atom 7, part of a three-membered ring with carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   It is substituted with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R,3R,4R,6S).\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate. The question provides two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  The attack occurs with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Starting Material**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n\n*   The molecule has a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. Such a fusion forces the cyclohexane part into a strained, half-chair conformation.\n*   The epoxide oxygen can be considered 'up' (beta face) or 'down' (alpha face). Let's assume it's on the beta face (wedged bond representation).\n*   The stereochemistry given is (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). Based on applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, we can deduce the orientation of the substituents:\n    *   **At C1 (R):** For the configuration to be R, the methyl group must be on the opposite side of the epoxide oxygen. So, with a beta epoxide, the Me at C1 is alpha (dashed).\n    *   **At C6 (S):** For the configuration to be S, the hydrogen atom must be on the opposite side of the epoxide oxygen. So, H at C6 is alpha (dashed).\n    *   **At C3 (R) and C4 (R):** The analysis shows that for these configurations to be correct, the methyl groups at C3 and C4 must be on the same side as the epoxide oxygen, i.e., beta (wedged).\n\nSo, the reactant has the epoxide oxygen, the C3-Me, and the C4-Me on the beta face (\"up\"), while the C1-Me and the C6-H are on the alpha face (\"down\").\n\n**3. Identify the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n\n*   The nucleophile Me⁻ must attack one of the two epoxide carbons: C1 or C6.\n*   According to the rule, attack occurs at the **less hindered** carbon.\n    *   **C1** is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   **C6** is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon.\n*   Furthermore, the attack occurs via a backside mechanism (S_N2-like). The nucleophile approaches from the face opposite the C-O bond. Since the epoxide is on the beta face, the attack comes from the alpha face.\n    *   Approaching C1 from the alpha face is blocked by the alpha methyl group already present on C1.\n    *   Approaching C6 from the alpha face is only hindered by the small alpha hydrogen atom.\n*   Therefore, the attack of the Me⁻ nucleophile will occur at **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Ring Opening:** The Me⁻ attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The epoxide oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **New Substituent:** A new methyl group is added to C6. Since the attack is from the alpha face, the new methyl group at C6 is in the alpha position.\n*   **Stereochemical Changes:**\n    *   **At C6:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration. The initial configuration was (S). It inverts to **(R)**.\n    *   **At C1:** This carbon is not attacked. The C1-O bond is cleaved, but the configuration at the stereocenter C1 is **retained**. It remains **(R)**.\n    *   **At C3 and C4:** These stereocenters are not involved in the reaction. Their configurations are retained as **(R)** and **(R)** respectively.\n\nThe resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. The OH is at the position of the original C1. The methyl groups are at the original positions C1, C3, C4, and a new one is at C6.\n\n**5. Name the Product According to IUPAC Rules**\n\n*   The functional group with the highest priority is the alcohol (-OH). The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as **new C1**. So, old C1 becomes new C1.\n*   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locant numbers. The substituents are at old C1, C3, C4, and C6.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from new C1 (old C1): We encounter the new methyl group at old C6 (which is **new C2**), then the methyl at old C4 (**new C4**), and the methyl at old C3 (**new C5**). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from new C1: We would get the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   Comparing {1,2,4,5} and {1,3,4,6}, the first set is lower. So, the counter-clockwise numbering is correct.\n*   The product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n**6. Final Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nNow we map the stereochemical descriptors to the new numbering system:\n\n*   **New C1** (is old C1): Configuration was (R) and is retained. So, it is **1R**.\n*   **New C2** (is old C6): Configuration was (S) and is inverted. So, it is **2R**.\n*   **New C4** (is old C4): Configuration was (R) and is retained. So, it is **4R**.\n*   **New C5** (is old C3): Configuration was (R) and is retained. So, it is **5R**.\n\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
