    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine (Br) atom at position 1 and a deuterium (D) atom at position 2. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen (H). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base (the active species being the amide ion, NH2-).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The strong base, NH2-, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        1.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n        2.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   The base can abstract either the deuterium from C2 or the hydrogen from C6. This leads to two parallel reaction pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n        1.  The NH2- base removes the deuteron (D+) from C2, creating a carbanion at C2.\n        2.  This carbanion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        3.  The result is the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The intermediate is benzyne. Since the deuterium was removed, the resulting benzyne has only hydrogen atoms attached to the ring carbons not involved in the triple bond.\n        4.  This pathway involves breaking a C-D bond, which is stronger than a C-H bond. Due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE), this pathway is slower than the alternative.\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n        1.  The NH2- base removes the proton (H+) from C6, creating a carbanion at C6.\n        2.  This carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C1.\n        3.  The result is the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        4.  Since this pathway involves breaking the weaker C-H bond, it is kinetically favored and will be the major pathway.\n\n    *   So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed: **Benzyne** (from Path A) and **3-deuterobenzyne** (from Path B).\n\n*   **Step 3: The Addition Step - Formation of Final Products**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH2-), now attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to give the final aniline products.\n\n    *   **Reaction of Benzyne (from Path A)**\n        1.  The NH2- ion can attack either C1 or C2 of the triple bond. Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, both attacks lead to the same carbanion.\n        2.  Protonation of the carbanion by NH3 yields a single product. Since the original deuterium was removed in the elimination step, this product is regular **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n        *   **Product 1: Aniline**\n\n    *   **Reaction of 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path B)**\n        1.  The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The NH2- ion can attack either C1 or C6. These two positions are not equivalent because of the deuterium at C2.\n        2.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2- adds to C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. After protonation at C6, the final product has the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Product 2: 2-deuterioaniline**\n        3.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2- adds to C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. After protonation at C1, the final product has the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When we number the ring starting from the -NH2 group, this is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Product 3: 3-deuterioaniline**\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The reaction proceeds through two different benzyne intermediates. One intermediate leads to one product, and the other intermediate leads to two distinct products. Therefore, there are a total of three possible organic products that can be formed.\n\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
