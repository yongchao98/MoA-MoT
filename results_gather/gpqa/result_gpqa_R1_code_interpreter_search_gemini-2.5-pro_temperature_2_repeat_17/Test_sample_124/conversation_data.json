    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the System**\n\nThe problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential energy is given by:\n$V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\nwhere $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This means the potential is the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2$\n\n**2. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by $E_i = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i$ is a non-negative integer quantum number.\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\n**3. Identifying the Energy Levels**\n\nWe need to find the energy of the *third excited state*. Let's list the energy levels starting from the lowest one:\n*   **Ground State:** This is the state with the lowest possible energy. It corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$, which is $n=0$ (when $n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0$).\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next highest energy level, corresponding to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have that same energy. For the energy level $E_n$, we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that add up to $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to have $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Let's list them:\n*   Combinations with a 3 and two 0s: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — **3 states**\n*   Combinations with a 2, a 1, and a 0: (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — **6 states**\n*   Combination with three 1s: (1, 1, 1) — **1 state**\n\nThe total number of states is the sum:\nTotal states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nTherefore, the third excited state has an energy of $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 — Incorrect energy formula (this is for an infinite spherical well).\n*   B) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10 — Matches our calculated energy and degeneracy.\n*   C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 — Incorrect degeneracy.\n*   D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 — Incorrect energy formula and degeneracy.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
