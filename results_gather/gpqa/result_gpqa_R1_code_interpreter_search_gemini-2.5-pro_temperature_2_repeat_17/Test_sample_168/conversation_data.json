    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\n*   **Original Decay:** The process is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`. The final state consists of six particles. However, for energy distribution purposes, we can think of it as three groups of particles sharing the available energy: the two B particles, the two E particles, and the two V particles.\n*   In any particle decay, if there are three or more particles in the final state, the total released energy (Q-value) is shared among them in a variable way, constrained only by the conservation of energy and momentum. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for each of the decay products. The problem statement confirms this by stating that the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous.\n*   **Variant Decay:** The new process is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`. In this case, the final state consists of five particles, which can be grouped into the B particles, the E particles, and the M particle.\n*   Since there are still three groups of particles (B's, E's, M) sharing the decay energy, the energy distribution will remain variable. The E particles will not receive a fixed amount of energy in every decay. Therefore, their total energy spectrum will also be **continuous**.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options A and D, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Endpoint of the Energy Spectrum\n\n*   The endpoint of the energy spectrum represents the maximum possible kinetic energy the E particles can carry away. This value is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value.\n*   The Q-value is calculated as the difference between the total mass of the initial particles and the total mass of the final particles, converted to energy via E=mc².\n    `Q = (mass_initial - mass_final) * c²`\n*   Let's calculate the Q-value for both decays. Let `m_X` be the mass of particle X.\n\n    *   **Q-value of the Original Decay (Q_orig):**\n        *   `mass_initial = 2 * m_A`\n        *   `mass_final = 2 * m_B + 2 * m_E + 2 * m_V`\n        *   `Q_orig = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)) * c²`\n\n    *   **Q-value of the Variant Decay (Q_variant):**\n        *   `mass_initial = 2 * m_A`\n        *   `mass_final = 2 * m_B + 2 * m_E + m_M`\n        *   The problem states that particle M is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n        *   `Q_variant = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 0)) * c²`\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   Let's compare `Q_orig` and `Q_variant`.\n        `Q_variant = (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E) * c²`\n        `Q_orig = (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E - 2*m_V) * c²`\n    *   The difference between them is `Q_variant - Q_orig = (2*m_V) * c²`.\n    *   The problem describes the V particles as \"much lighter particles,\" which implies they have a non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`).\n    *   Therefore, `(2*m_V) * c²` is a positive quantity, which means `Q_variant > Q_orig`.\n*   The total energy released in the variant decay is greater than in the original decay. This is because the rest mass energy required to create two massive V particles (`2*m_V*c²`) is now available as kinetic energy for the final products in the variant decay.\n*   A higher total released energy (Q-value) means that the maximum possible energy for the E particles—the endpoint of their spectrum—will be higher. Thus, the **endpoint increases**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1.  The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n2.  The endpoint **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
