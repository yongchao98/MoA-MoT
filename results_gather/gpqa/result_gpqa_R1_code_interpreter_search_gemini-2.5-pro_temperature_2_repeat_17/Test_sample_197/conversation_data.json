    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation process to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Define the Chemical System**\n\nThe solution contains a central metal ion, Co(II) (`Co^2+`), and a ligand, thiocyanate (`SCN-`). They form a series of complexes. The equilibria for the formation of these complexes are described by the overall stability constants (β).\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]2-]`\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the fraction (`α_2`) of `[Co(SCN)2]` relative to `c(Co)`:\n`α_2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nTo calculate this, we can express all cobalt species' concentrations in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN-]`. The problem states `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`. In complexation problems, it is common to assume that a given ligand concentration, especially when in excess, represents the free (unbound) ligand concentration at equilibrium.\n\nUsing the stability constant definitions:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1[Co^2+][SCN-]) + (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) + (β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3) + (β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNow we can write the expression for the fraction `α_2`:\n`α_2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α_2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nThis powerful result shows that the fractional distribution of complexes depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants, not on the total metal concentration.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow we plug the given values into the formula.\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nTo make it easier, let's calculate each term in the expression:\n*   **Numerator**: `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   `Term 0 (for Co^2+)`: 1\n    *   `Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]+)`: `β1 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)2])`: `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)3]-)`: `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)4]2-)`: `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α_2`:\n`α_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation can be done with a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Define the given constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator and denominator terms for the fraction alpha_2\nnumerator = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * SCN_conc**1) + (beta2 * SCN_conc**2) + (beta3 * SCN_conc**3) + (beta4 * SCN_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n16.91618032648228\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System of Equilibria**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (`βn`):\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]+` with `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]` with `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]-` with `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2-` with `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Define the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n**3. Express Concentrations in Terms of a Common Species**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN-]` using the stability constants:\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n**4. Formulate the Fraction of the Target Complex**\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which we'll call `α2`, is the concentration of `[Co(SCN)2]` divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNow substitute these into the fraction formula for `α2`:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNotice that the final calculation only depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants, not the total metal concentration.\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`, `β2 = 40`, `β3 = 63`, `β4 = 16`\n\nCalculate the numerator:\nNumerator = `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the denominator:\nDenominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nCalculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the calculation from the code output (16.916%). Comparing this result with the given options, the closest is 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
