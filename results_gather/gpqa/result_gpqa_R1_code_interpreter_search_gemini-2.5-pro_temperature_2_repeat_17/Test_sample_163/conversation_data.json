    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (M_total = m1 + m2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n        *   Exhibits eclipses.\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n        *   Exhibits eclipses.\n\n3.  **Select the Relevant Physical Law:** The relationship between the masses of stars in a binary system and their orbital properties is described by Kepler's Third Law. For a spectroscopic binary, this can be expressed in terms of the observable quantities: the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mass Equation:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (m1 + m2) can be calculated using the following formula, assuming circular orbits (implied by sinusoidal radial velocity curves):\n    M_total = m1 + m2 = (P / (2πG)) * (v1 + v2)³\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   v1 and v2 are the orbital velocities of the stars.\n\n5.  **Relate Observables to Physical Velocities:** The observed quantities are the *amplitudes* of the radial velocities (K), not the true orbital velocities (v). They are related by the inclination angle (i) of the orbit:\n    K = v * sin(i)\n    Therefore, v = K / sin(i).\n    Substituting this into the mass equation gives:\n    M_total = (P / (2πG)) * [(K1 + K2) / sin(i)]³\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\n6.  **Use the \"Eclipse\" Information:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is crucial because it tells us that the orbits are viewed edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   If i = 90°, then sin(i) = 1, and sin³(i) = 1.\n    This simplifies the mass equation significantly for both systems:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2πG)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Masses:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    *   M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2πG)\n    *   M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2πG)\n\n    When we take the ratio, the constant term (1 / 2πG) cancels out:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n8.  **Substitute the Numerical Values:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n    Plugging these into the ratio equation:\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432. This is approximately 0.4.\n\nTo verify the arithmetic, we can use a short Python script.\n```python\nP1 = 2.0  # Period of system 1 in years\nP2 = 1.0  # Period of system 2 in years\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes for system 1 in km/s\nK1_sum = 10.0 + 5.0\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes for system 2 in km/s\nK2_sum = 15.0 + 10.0\n\n# The ratio of total masses M1/M2 is given by (P1/P2) * (K1_sum/K2_sum)^3\n# The formula for total mass M is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3 for eclipsing binaries.\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.432, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final calculation yields a ratio of approximately 0.432. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.7\n*   B) ~ 0.4\n*   C) ~ 0.6\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
