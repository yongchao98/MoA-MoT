    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule is a derivative of a benzene ring. It contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde/Formyl (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. The priority order for these groups is:\nCarboxylic acid > Cyano > Carbaldehyde > Hydroxyl > Amino > Ether (Methoxy)\n\nTherefore, the **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is the principal functional group. This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned locant **C1**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of Substituents\n\nLet's place the substituents on the benzene ring based on the description, starting with C1 as the attachment point for the -COOH group.\n\n*   **Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.**\n    *   The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, a **methoxy (-OCH3) group is at C4**.\n\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino.**\n    *   The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, a **hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at C2 and C6**. We don't yet know which is at C2 and which is at C6.\n\n*   **A carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another.**\n    *   This implies a 1,3,5 substitution pattern. Since -COOH is at C1, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   **The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.**\n    *   This is the key piece of information to resolve the ambiguities. The nitrile (-CN) group is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the position of the cyano group:\n\n    **Case A: The cyano (-CN) group is at C3.**\n    *   The substituents ortho to C3 are at C2 and C4.\n    *   The description states the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   We already placed methoxy at C4, which is indeed ortho to C3. This is consistent.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group must be at the other ortho position, which is C2.\n    *   If -OH is at C2, then the dimethylamino group must be at C6 (as C2 and C6 have one of each).\n    *   If -CN is at C3, then the carbaldehyde (-CHO) must be at C5 (as C3 and C5 have one of each).\n\n    This leads to the following structure (Structure I):\n    *   **C1: -COOH**\n    *   **C2: -OH (hydroxy)**\n    *   **C3: -CN (cyano)**\n    *   **C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)**\n    *   **C5: -CHO (formyl)**\n    *   **C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)**\n\n    **Case B: The cyano (-CN) group is at C5.**\n    *   The substituents ortho to C5 are at C4 and C6.\n    *   The description states methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile.\n    *   Methoxy is at C4, which is ortho to C5. Consistent.\n    *   This means the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n    *   This would place the dimethylamino group at C2 and the carbaldehyde at C3. This gives Structure II.\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nWe have two potential structures (I and II) that fit the description. They are constitutional isomers. However, IUPAC rules provide a unique name. Let's analyze the numbering. C1 is fixed. We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\nThe substituents are at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} in both cases. When the set of locants is identical, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The lowest locants are assigned to the substituents cited first in the name (i.e., first alphabetically).\n\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Now let's see which position the first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, gets in each numbering scheme.\n    *   In the numbering that gives **Structure I**, the **cyano** group is at **C3**.\n    *   In the numbering that gives **Structure II**, the **cyano** group is at **C5**.\n\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme that leads to **Structure I is the correct one.**\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nWe use the correct structure (Structure I) and its numbering.\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents and positions:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-dimethylamino\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nFinally, we arrange the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n\n1.  3-cyano\n2.  6-(dimethylamino)\n3.  5-formyl\n4.  2-hydroxy\n5.  4-methoxy\n\nCombining these gives the final name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.*\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Correct numbering, but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes in the name.*\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
