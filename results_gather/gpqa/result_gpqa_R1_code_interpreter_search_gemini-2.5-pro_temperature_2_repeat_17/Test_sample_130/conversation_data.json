    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid anhydride derived from a *cis*-alkene. Its ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This perfectly matches the spectral data for **maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃)**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, giving a singlet at ~7 ppm. The two alkene carbons are equivalent (~137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (~165 ppm).\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄)**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system (double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and methyl groups attached to each of these four carbons. The C5 position is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic product.\n    *   The problem states that two products, a major and a minor one, are formed. In Diels-Alder reactions, this typically corresponds to the formation of *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers. According to the endo rule, the *endo* adduct is usually the kinetically favored (major) product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structures and NMR Signals:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between these two reactants forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n    *   The CH₂ group of the cyclopentadiene becomes the one-carbon bridge (C7) of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The four methyl groups from the diene are now located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and the vinylic positions (C2, C3) of the new product.\n    *   The anhydride moiety is fused to carbons C5 and C6. The two protons originally on the maleic anhydride are now on C5 and C6.\n    *   Both the *endo* and *exo* products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2=C3 bond, the C7 bridge, and the anhydride group. This symmetry has important consequences for the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   The two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4) are equivalent and will appear as a single 6H singlet. These are on sp³ carbons and would be upfield, around **~1 ppm**. Let's call them **Me_b**.\n        *   The two vinylic methyl groups (at C2 and C3) are equivalent and will appear as a single 6H singlet. These are on sp² carbons and would be more downfield, around **~1.7 ppm**. Let's call them **Me_v**.\n        *   The two protons on the anhydride-fused part (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. They are not coupled to adjacent protons (C1 and C4 have methyl groups, not protons). They will appear as a 2H singlet. Being adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group, they will be significantly downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**. Let's call them **H5/H6**.\n        *   The two protons on the C7 bridge (H7) are diastereotopic (one is *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond, one is *anti*). They will appear as two distinct signals, likely two 1H doublets due to geminal coupling. They are on a saturated carbon, so their chemical shifts would be in the aliphatic region, plausibly around **~1.5 ppm** for one of them. Let's call them **H7_syn** and **H7_anti**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between nuclei that are close in space (< 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n    *   Major product = *endo* adduct.\n    *   Minor product = *exo* adduct.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n5.  **Compare Spatial Proximities in *Endo* and *Exo* Adducts:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct:** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C2=C3 double bond. The protons H5 and H6 are in the *exo* position, meaning they point away from the double bond and towards the C7 bridge. In this orientation, the *exo*-H5/H6 protons are close to the *anti*-H7 proton (the one on the C7 bridge that also points away from the double bond).\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge, pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond. The protons H5 and H6 are in the *endo* position, pointing \"under\" the C1-C6/C4-C5 bonds towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, H5/H6 are now far from the *anti*-H7 proton but are close to the *syn*-H7 proton and the vinylic methyls (Me_v).\n\n    **Conclusion:** The key differentiating NOE is the one between **H5/H6** and the ***anti*-H7 proton**. This NOE will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or very weak in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n6.  **Match the Finding to the Answer Choices:**\n    *   The interacting protons are H5/H6 and one of the H7 protons (specifically H7_anti).\n    *   The resonance for H5/H6 is the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   The resonance for one of the H7 protons is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_b) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_v): An NOE between these is expected in both isomers.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_v) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H5/H6): An NOE is expected for the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) one.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_b) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H7 proton): An NOE is plausible in both isomers between Me_b and H7_anti.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H7 proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H5/H6): This corresponds to the H7_anti to H5/H6 interaction that is uniquely strong in the *endo* (major) product.\n\nThis perfectly matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
