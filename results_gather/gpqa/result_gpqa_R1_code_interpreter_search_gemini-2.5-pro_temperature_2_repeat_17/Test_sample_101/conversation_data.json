The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background.

    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental design.**\n    *   The goal is to study a ligand-receptor pair from neural crest cells.\n    *   A mouse model is created with a special bicistronic DNA construct. This construct is designed to be \"conditionally active.\"\n    *   The construct's promoter is CBA, a strong and widely active promoter. This means that in any cell containing this construct, the machinery to transcribe it into mRNA is likely present.\n    *   The construct is designed to produce two proteins from one mRNA molecule, thanks to the IRES (Internal Ribosomal Entry Site).\n        1.  **First protein:** Ligand, which is supposed to be fused to mCherry (a red fluorescent protein).\n        2.  **Second protein:** Receptor, which is supposed to be fused to eGFP (a green fluorescent protein).\n    *   Both fusions are conditional. They are initially blocked by \"STOP\" cassettes flanked by specific DNA sequences (loxP and lox2272).\n        *   Ligand -> [loxP-STOP-loxP] -> mCherry\n        *   Receptor -> [lox2272-STOP-lox2272] -> eGFP\n    *   To activate the construct, a specific enzyme called Cre recombinase is needed. Cre recognizes the loxP and lox2272 sites and cuts out the DNA between them, including the STOP sequence.\n    *   To ensure this happens only in the cells of interest (neural crest cells and their derivatives), the mouse with the construct is crossed with a SOX10-Cre mouse. SOX10 is a gene active in neural crest cells, so Cre recombinase will only be produced in these cells.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the outcome of the experiment.**\n    *   In the offspring that have both the construct and the SOX10-Cre gene, the following should happen in neural crest-derived cells:\n        1.  The CBA promoter drives the transcription of the construct's mRNA.\n        2.  Cre recombinase is expressed from the SOX10 promoter.\n        3.  Cre removes the [loxP-STOP-loxP] cassette. This should result in a single translatable open reading frame (ORF) for Ligand-mCherry. The cells should become red.\n        4.  Cre also removes the [lox2272-STOP-lox2272] cassette. This should result in a single translatable ORF for Receptor-eGFP. The cells should become green.\n    *   The expected result is that neural crest-derived cells in the offspring should be both red and green.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the observed result and evaluate the potential causes.**\n    *   **Observed Result:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\" This means the Receptor-eGFP protein is not being produced or is not fluorescent.\n    *   Let's evaluate the given options:\n\n        *   **A) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.** The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it is synthesized in the ER and trafficked through the Golgi. If it were stuck in the Golgi, the eGFP would still be synthesized, correctly folded, and fluorescent. A confocal microscope would detect this fluorescence, although it would be located inside the cell (in a Golgi-like pattern) rather than at the cell membrane. The observation is a *complete absence* of signal, not a mislocalized signal. So, this is unlikely.\n\n        *   **B) The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.** This addresses what happens to the DNA sequence *after* Cre recombination. The process is as follows:\n            *   Before recombination: `...Receptor ORF]...` -> `[lox2272]-[STOP]-[lox2272]` -> `...[eGFP ORF]...`\n            *   After recombination, the [STOP] cassette is removed, but one copy of the lox2272 site remains: `...Receptor ORF]...` -> `[lox2272]` -> `...[eGFP ORF]...`\n            *   A standard lox site (like loxP or lox2272) is 34 base pairs (bp) long.\n            *   For a protein fusion to work, the two parts (Receptor and eGFP) must be in the same \"reading frame.\" Since proteins are read in codons of 3 base pairs, any insertion or deletion of bases that is not a multiple of 3 will shift the reading frame.\n            *   The insertion of the remaining 34 bp lox2272 site will cause a frameshift (34 is not divisible by 3; 34 = 3 * 11 + 1).\n            *   This means that after the ribosome translates the Receptor ORF, it will read through the lox2272 sequence and then enter the eGFP sequence in the wrong frame. This will result in a garbled amino acid sequence and, almost certainly, a premature stop codon. A functional, fluorescent eGFP protein will not be made. This perfectly explains the complete absence of a green signal. This is a common and critical mistake in designing such constructs.\n\n        *   **C) Ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.** A paracrine relationship describes how cells communicate (a cell signals a nearby cell). This is a biological function, not a molecular mechanism of gene expression. The type of signaling relationship has no bearing on whether the Receptor-eGFP protein is successfully synthesized inside the cell. Therefore, this cannot explain the lack of a green signal.\n\n        *   **D) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.** An enhancer is a regulatory DNA sequence that boosts transcription. In this experiment, the native enhancer/promoter of the gene is irrelevant because expression is driven by the very strong, provided CBA promoter. The specificity is achieved by the SOX10-Cre system, not by the promoter on the construct itself. Therefore, a missing native enhancer is not the problem.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the most likely reason.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the frameshift caused by the residual 34 bp lox2272 site after recombination is the most direct and certain reason for the failure to produce a functional eGFP protein, leading to a lack of green signal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
