    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basic Concepts**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This assumption means that the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant throughout space. That is, the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is an apparent shift of a nearby star's position against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is `plx = k/d`, where `k` is a constant. For simplicity in astrophysics (using parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax), this relationship is simply `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Number of Stars within a certain Distance**\n    *   Let's find the total number of stars, `N(d)`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N(d)` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to consider how the number of stars changes as parallax changes. It's easier to first find how the number of stars changes with distance and then convert to parallax.\n    *   Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume of the sphere with respect to its radius `d`:\n        `dV/dd = d/dd [ (4/3)πd³ ] = 4πd²`\n        So, `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is the density times the shell's volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    *   This equation gives us the number of stars found at a distance `d` within a small distance range `dd`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Differential in Distance (`dd`) to the Differential in Parallax (`d(plx)`)**\n    *   We have the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find how `dd` relates to `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = -d(plx) / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars, we can consider the magnitude: `|dd| = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n5.  **Substitute Distance and `dd` with Parallax and `d(plx)`**\n    *   Now we take our expression for `dN` and replace all the terms involving distance (`d` and `dd`) with terms involving parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   Original expression: `dN = 4πρd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = d(plx) / plx²` (ignoring the negative sign as we care about the magnitude):\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (d(plx) / plx²) `\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can simply divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    *   In this final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
