    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A C3 axis of rotation: Rotation by 120° about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n2.  A σh horizontal mirror plane: A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**D) Quinuclidine** (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)\n*   **Structure**: This is a cage-like molecule with a nitrogen atom and a CH group at the two bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and bisect one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   There is **no** horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. A plane in the middle of the cage would not reflect the top half onto the bottom half.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes but no σh plane defines the **C3v** point group. Thus, quinuclidine is not C3h.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone** (Mellitic trianhydride)\n*   **Structure**: This molecule consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups (-C(O)-O-C(O)-) on alternating sides. The formula is C12O9. The molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   Being planar, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   In addition to these, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, each passing through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of opposite bonds of the central ring.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D point group family.\n*   **Point Group**: A C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane define the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains the C3h symmetry elements (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. Usually, questions about point groups ask for the highest possible point group describing the molecule's entire symmetry.\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This molecule has a triphenylene core, which is a planar D3h molecule. Three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically onto the outer rings of the triphenylene structure.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: Like the triphenylene core, the resulting large molecule is also planar. The high symmetry is preserved. It possesses:\n    *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   A σh horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane).\n    *   Three C2 axes within the plane.\n*   **Point Group**: Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule has **D3h** symmetry. It is of a higher symmetry order than C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-O-CH(CH3)2). The arrangement around the boron atom is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements**: We need to consider possible conformations.\n    *   The lowest energy conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape, where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction to minimize steric hindrance. This conformation has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes, giving it a C3 point group.\n    *   However, it is possible to envision an idealized, higher-energy conformation that exhibits C3h symmetry. In this conformation:\n        1.  The boron atom, the three oxygen atoms, the three adjacent carbons (methine carbons), and their attached hydrogens lie in a single plane. This plane can act as the σh mirror plane.\n        2.  For each isopropyl group, one methyl group (-CH3) is positioned above this plane, and the other is below it.\n        3.  The molecule has a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n    *   This specific conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. Does it have other symmetry elements, like the perpendicular C2 axes that would raise it to D3h? No. Because the B-O-C bond is bent (not 180°), the isopropyl groups are \"cranked\" relative to the B-O bonds. If you attempt a C2 rotation along one B-O bond, the other two isopropyl groups do not map onto each other.\n*   **Point Group**: Therefore, triisopropyl borate is the only molecule on the list for which **C3h** is its highest possible point group (even if it's for an idealized conformation).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMolecules A and C have D3h symmetry. Molecule D has C3v symmetry. Molecule B is the only one that fits the C3h point group without belonging to a higher symmetry group. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
