    "An essential principle in quantum mechanics is the normalization of the wave function. The total probability of finding a particle in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. This probability is determined by integrating the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over the specified region.\n\n1.  **Define the Wave Function:**\n    The wave function is given as a complex function:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density Function:**\n    The probability density, |ψ(x)|², is found by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate. For a complex number z = Re + i\\*Im, its magnitude squared is |z|² = Re² + Im².\n    In our case:\n    *   Real part: Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    *   Imaginary part: Im(ψ) = -0.5\n    So, the probability density is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Apply the Normalization Condition:**\n    The problem states that the particle is only found between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must equal 1.\n    ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    ∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral:**\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   The first part:\n        ∫₁³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n        = a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n        = a² (ln(4) - ln(2))\n        = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2)\n\n    *   The second part:\n        ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n        = 0.25(3) - 0.25(1)\n        = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n    *   Combining the parts:\n        a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for the constant 'a'.\n    a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use the known value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215) ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is very close to 0.85. To confirm, let's calculate it precisely.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\na = math.sqrt(0.5 / math.log(2))\nprint(a)\n```\n> executing ...\n> 0.8493264639915993\n\nThe calculated value of \"a\" is approximately 0.849, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
