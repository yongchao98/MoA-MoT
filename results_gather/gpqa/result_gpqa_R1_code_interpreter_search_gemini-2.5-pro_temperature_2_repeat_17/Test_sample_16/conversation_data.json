    "The user wants to find the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$) can be represented by the following equilibrium:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The question provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The problem starts with the product ($CaY^{2-}$), so it is more convenient to use the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$   | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    *Note*: The problem states \"pH is ideal\", which means we can assume EDTA exists fully as $Y^{4-}$ and do not need to consider its protonated forms. This allows us to use the given absolute formation constant directly.\n\n4.  **Solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Since $K_f$ is very large, $K_d$ is very small. This indicates that the dissociation is minimal, and thus 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now, the equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.02 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-11})$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is 'x'. Therefore, $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n5.  **Using Python for Calculation**: Let's confirm the calculation precisely. The equation to solve is $x^2 = \\frac{[\\text{Initial Ca-EDTA}]}{K_f}$\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ninitial_concentration = 0.02\nK_formation = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium expression for dissociation is Kd = x^2 / (initial_concentration - x)\n# Where Kd = 1/K_formation.\n# We approximate initial_concentration - x as initial_concentration.\n# So, x^2 / initial_concentration = 1 / K_formation\n# x^2 = initial_concentration / K_formation\n# x = sqrt(initial_concentration / K_formation)\n\nx = math.sqrt(initial_concentration / K_formation)\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code yields the result `6.32e-07`, which represents $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 6.3x10^-7 M\nD) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($[Ca^{2+}]$) in a solution prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    The Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$, where Y⁴⁻ represents the EDTA tetra-anion) dissociates into its constituent ions. The reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    The equilibrium is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate Formation and Dissociation Constants:**\n    The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    Since our reaction is dissociation, we should use the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    The problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the calculation by allowing us to ignore the protonation of EDTA and use the given absolute formation constant.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table:**\n    Let's track the concentrations of the species. We start with 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex and no free Ca²⁺ or EDTA. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$   | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n5.  **Apply Simplification:**\n    Because the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is extremely small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for a valid approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x:**\n    Now, we solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.02 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-11})$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\n    The python code confirms this calculation: `6.32e-07`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option C.\n\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 2.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
