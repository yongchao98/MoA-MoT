    "*   **Analyze the wild-type protein:** The protein functions as a dimer. A single subunit (monomer) must first be activated by phosphorylation, then pair up with another subunit (dimerize), and then the dimer moves to the nucleus to activate transcription. Both dimerization and transactivation domains must be functional.\n\n*   **Analyze Mutation X:** This is a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain. \"Recessive\" means that in a heterozygote (WT/X), there is enough functional protein produced from the wild-type (WT) allele to maintain a normal phenotype. The mutant X protein is produced but is non-functional (it likely can't activate transcription). It doesn't interfere with the WT protein. The cell can make functional WT-WT dimers, and this is sufficient for its needs. A loss-of-function phenotype is only seen in an X/X individual where no functional protein can be made.\n\n*   **Analyze Mutation Y:** This is a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.\n    *   **\"Dominant\"** means it exerts its effect even when a wild-type allele is present (in a WT/Y heterozygote).\n    *   **\"Negative\"** means the effect is a loss of function.\n    *   **\"Dominant-Negative\" mechanism:** This occurs when a mutant protein not only loses its own function but also actively interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced by the other allele. This is common with proteins that form multimers (dimers, trimers, etc.).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The cell produces both WT and Y subunits. The mutation is in the dimerization domain, but for it to be dominant-negative, the mutant Y subunit must still be able to dimerize with the WT subunit. If it couldn't dimerize at all, it couldn't interfere, and the mutation would be recessive (like in option C).\n    *   **The outcome:** The Y subunit dimerizes with the WT subunit, forming a WT-Y heterodimer. This dimer is non-functional because the Y subunit is defective. By \"trapping\" the WT subunit in a useless complex, the Y subunit prevents the WT subunit from forming a functional WT-WT dimer. This effectively reduces the amount of functional protein far below the necessary threshold, causing a loss-of-function phenotype even in a heterozygote. This interference is described as causing a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele's product\".\n\n*   **Evaluate the options based on this understanding:**\n\n    *   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most accurate description. The mutant Y protein's interference with the wild-type protein leads to a loss of function of the wild-type protein product. The resulting malformed WT-Y dimers may also be recognized by the cell's quality control systems and targeted for protein degradation. This option correctly identifies the key feature of a dominant-negative mutation: antagonism of the wild-type allele's function.\n\n    *   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While some mutations cause aggregation, the defining mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein is interference by forming non-functional heterodimers, not necessarily large-scale aggregation. This option is less specific and potentially inaccurate.\n\n    *   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** If the mutation caused a total loss of dimerization ability, the mutant protein couldn't interfere with the wild-type. The wild-type proteins would be free to form functional WT-WT dimers. This would result in a *recessive* mutation and a wild-type phenotype in a heterozygote, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\n    *   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This describes the opposite of a dominant-negative mutation. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the molecular phenotype of a dominant-negative mutation in this dimeric protein is the interference with, and consequent loss of function of, the protein from the wild-type allele.\n\n<<<A>>>"
