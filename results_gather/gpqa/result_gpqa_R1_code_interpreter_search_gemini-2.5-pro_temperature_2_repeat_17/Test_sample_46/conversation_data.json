    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\nThe formula for DoU is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nwhere C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n\nFor C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is too high for an amide (typically 1630-1690 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly for a **conjugated ester (C=O)**. An ester conjugated with an aromatic ring usually appears between 1715-1730 cm⁻¹.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can conclude the molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this group is adjacent to a group with n=2 protons, i.e., a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   This triplet at ~1.2 ppm strongly suggests the `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, characteristic of a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** According to the n+1 rule, this group is adjacent to a group with n=3 protons, i.e., a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group. Such a shift is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, specifically in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we can confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group as part of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. A 2H broad singlet strongly supports the presence of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which is consistent with our IR analysis.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Chemical Shift & Multiplicity:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The two sets of protons are chemically different because they are ortho to different substituents. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOR ester group).\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's assemble the fragments we've identified:\n1.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring that connects them.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester (contradicts IR C=O stretch). The aromatic substitution pattern would be 1,3-(meta), not 1,4-(para).\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has an O-CO-CH₂CH₃ group. The -CH₂- group would be next to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. All features perfectly match the IR and NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
