    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region, indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The relatively high shift (deshielded) suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it is coupled to (i.e., adjacent to) only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. A large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) for vinylic protons is characteristic of a **trans** relationship across the double bond.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region, indicating another proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm). The \"quartet\" part means it's coupled to three equivalent adjacent protons (typically a methyl, -CH3, group).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the protons of an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon). This confirms the acetate fragment: -O-C(=O)-CH3.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the alkyl/allylic region.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, which means this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with a single proton (a -CH group).\n\n### **2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  An acetate group: **-O-C(=O)-CH3** (from the 3H singlet at 2.1 ppm).\n2.  A trans double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the two vinylic signals, with J=16.0 Hz confirming *trans*).\n3.  A methyl group attached to one of the vinylic protons: **CH3-CH=** (from the 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm being coupled to the 1H vinylic proton, which must be the one showing quartet splitting at 5.5 ppm).\n\n### **3. Construct the Final Structure**\n\nLet's put the fragments together:\n\n*   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). This proton is on the double bond (`=CH-`), is split by one other proton across the double bond (the doublet), and is split by a methyl group (the quartet). This corresponds to the **CH3-CH=** fragment.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet. This proton is on the double bond (`=CH-`) and is only split by the other vinylic proton. This proton is also highly deshielded, indicating it's attached to the carbon bonded to the acetate's oxygen. This corresponds to the **=CH-O-** fragment.\n*   The J-value of 16.0 Hz confirms these two vinylic protons are in a *trans* configuration.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n```\n      H(5.5 ppm)    O\n      |            //\nCH3-C ------- C-O-C-CH3(2.1 ppm)\n(1.6 ppm)    |\n             H(7.0 ppm, J=16.0 Hz)\n```\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data:\n*   **Trans** double bond protons with J=16.0 Hz.\n*   An **acetate methyl group** as a singlet.\n*   A **methyl group on the double bond** appearing as a doublet.\n*   The correct multiplicities for both vinylic protons.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate & D) Cis-butenyl acetate:** These structures would contain an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-) instead of the methyl group attached to the double bond. This would result in different signals (e.g., a triplet and a multiplet for the ethyl group), which are not present in the given spectrum. Therefore, the butenyl acetate options are incorrect.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This would have a smaller coupling constant (J â‰ˆ 6-12 Hz) between the vinylic protons. The observed J=16.0 Hz rules out this isomer.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure and stereochemistry perfectly match the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
