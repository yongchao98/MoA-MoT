    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Fundamental Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum State:** In this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number *n* (or energy level), where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number *m_s*, which can be spin-up (+1/2) or spin-down (-1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The system is a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy for a single particle in the *n*-th level is:\n    $E_n = n^2 * \\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n    So, $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$, $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$, $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$, and so on.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 × $E_1$ = 2 × E = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contribution = 2 × $E_2$ = 2 × (4E) = 8E.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** We sum the energies of all four particles.\n    *   $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### **3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest total energy after the ground state. We create this by promoting a particle with the smallest possible energy increase. This typically involves moving a particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Promotion:** We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles → Energy = 2 × $E_1$ = 2E\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle → Energy = 1 × $E_2$ = 4E\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle → Energy = 1 × $E_3$ = 9E\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy promotions from the ground state and find the second smallest total energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from promoting n=2 → n=3)\n\nLet's examine other possible excitations from the ground state:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × $E_1$) + (2 × $E_2$) + (1 × $E_3$) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × $E_1$) + (2 × $E_3$) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 × $E_1$) + (1 × $E_2$) + (1 × $E_4$) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the total energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    *   $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
