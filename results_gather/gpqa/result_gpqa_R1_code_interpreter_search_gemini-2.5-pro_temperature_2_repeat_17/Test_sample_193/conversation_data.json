    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System and its States:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n    Each spin can take one of two values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n    The total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 2³ = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):**\n    The partition function is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for each state:\n    Z = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\n    where β = 1/(kT) and E_i is the energy of the i-th state.\n    If multiple states have the same energy (degeneracy), we can group them:\n    Z = Σ_levels g_j * e^(-βE_j)\n    where g_j is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_j.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy for Each State:**\n    The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n    We need to calculate this energy for all 8 possible states. Let's list the states and their corresponding energies.\n\n    *   **State 1: All spins up**\n        (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n        E₁ = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n        There is only one state like this.\n\n    *   **State 2: Two spins up, one spin down**\n        There are three such combinations:\n        a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        b) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J[ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three of these states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n    *   **State 3: One spin up, two spins down**\n        There are three such combinations:\n        a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        b) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J[ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = J\n        All three of these states also have the same energy, E = J.\n\n    *   **State 4: All spins down**\n        (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n        E₈ = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = -3J\n        There is only one state like this.\n\n4.  **Identify Energy Levels and their Degeneracies:**\n    From the calculations above, we can identify two distinct energy levels:\n    *   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:** This energy occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). So, the degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n    *   **Energy Level E₂ = J:** This energy occurs for the six remaining states (3 states with two spins up, and 3 states with one spin up). So, the degeneracy g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6.\n    The total number of states accounted for is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    Now, we plug the energy levels and their degeneracies into the formula for Z:\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\n    B) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n    C) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\n    D) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n\n    Our calculated partition function, Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ), matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
