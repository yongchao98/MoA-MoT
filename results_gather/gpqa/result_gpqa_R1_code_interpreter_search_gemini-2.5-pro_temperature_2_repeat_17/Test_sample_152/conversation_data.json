These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "*   **Analysis of Reaction A**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate (`CH₂(CO₂Me)₂`). In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the highly acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n        *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n        *   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is the base, and ethanol (EtOH) is the solvent.\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n        1.  The malonate enolate `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂` acts as a nucleophile.\n        2.  It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        3.  The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH).\n    *   **Product Formation:**\n        *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   Donor C: `-CH(CO₂Me)₂`\n        *   Acceptor C skeleton: `p-tolyl-C(β)-C(α)-CO₂Me`\n        *   Product structure after attack and protonation: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂)-CH₂(α)-CO₂Me`\n    *   **Product Naming (A):**\n        *   Let's analyze the name given in options C and D: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n        *   This name implies a propane (3-carbon) backbone.\n        *   At C1: two `CO₂Me` groups (`-CH(CO₂Me)₂`)\n        *   At C2: a `p-tolyl` group (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`)\n        *   At C3: one `CO₂Me` group (`-CH₂-CO₂Me`)\n        *   Connecting these gives the structure: `MeO₂C-CH₂(3)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH(CO₂Me)₂(1)`.\n        *   This structure exactly matches the one we derived from the reaction mechanism: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n        *   Therefore, the product A is correctly named trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction B**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which is a nitrogen analog of an enolate and is nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 position of the original cyclohexanone). This reaction type is known as the Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael addition mechanism.\n        *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n        *   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) as a solvent, followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n        2.  This forms an iminium ion and a carbanion (nitrile-stabilized).\n        3.  The carbanion is protonated.\n        4.  The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone).\n    *   **Product Formation:**\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is regenerated.\n        *   A new substituent is attached at the α-carbon (C2) of the cyclohexanone.\n        *   The substituent is derived from but-2-enenitrile, `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n        *   The final product is 2-substituted cyclohexanone: a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   **Product Naming (B):**\n        *   Let's analyze the name given in options C and D: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n        *   The parent chain is butanenitrile (`NC-C-C-C`).\n        *   `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`.\n        *   At position C3, there is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent.\n        *   This structure is identical to the one we derived. The final product is a ketone, not the enol form listed in options A and B, because the acidic workup ensures hydrolysis and tautomerization to the more stable keto form.\n        *   Therefore, product B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. This is consistent with options C and D.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction C**\n    *   **Reactants & Product:**\n        *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n        *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n        *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n        *   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a base, and water (H₂O) as the solvent.\n    *   **Retrosynthetic Analysis:**\n        1.  The Michael reaction forms a C-C bond between the donor and the acceptor. We need to identify this bond in the product to deduce the donor.\n        2.  The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core and a `3-oxobutyl` side chain (`-CH₂CH₂C(=O)CH₃`) at position 2.\n        3.  The `3-oxobutyl` group comes from the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one, after it accepts the nucleophile and gets protonated.\n        4.  Therefore, the nucleophile (Michael donor) must be the enolate of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core.\n        5.  Reactant C is deprotonated by KOH at the highly acidic C2 position (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n        6.  This enolate then attacks the MVK to form the product.\n    *   **Identity of C:**\n        *   Reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n        *   Option C states that C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n        *   Option D states that C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is not the correct starting material.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n    *   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n    *   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
