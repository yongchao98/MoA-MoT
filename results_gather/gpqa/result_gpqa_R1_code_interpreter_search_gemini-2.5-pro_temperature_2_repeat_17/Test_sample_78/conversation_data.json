    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Provided Information**\n    *   **Reactant:** Compound X, with molecular formula C11H12O.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent at a high temperature (403 K = 130 °C). These conditions suggest a base-catalyzed thermal rearrangement or isomerization, as the molecular formula of the product should be the same as the reactant (C11H12O).\n    *   **Product Spectroscopy Data:** We are given the ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR data for the final product. Our goal is to deduce the structure of this product, and then work backward to identify the starting material, Compound X.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Structure of the Product from NMR Data**\n\n    *   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a **carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, specifically from a ketone or an aldehyde.\n        *   The total number of carbons accounted for is 1 (21.3) + 1 (28.4) + 2 (126.9) + 1 (127.1) + 2 (129.1) + 1 (130.3) + 1 (141.5) + 1 (144.1) + 1 (197.7) = 11 carbons. This matches the molecular formula C**11**H12O.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   The total number of protons is 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 protons. This matches the molecular formula C11**H12**O.\n        *   **δ 9-10 ppm region:** There are no signals in this range, which rules out the presence of an aldehyde. Therefore, the carbonyl group at δ 197.7 ppm must be a **ketone**.\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split only by their ortho neighbors.\n        *   **Alkyl Region:** The two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** indicate two methyl (-CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (i.e., they are attached to quaternary carbons or carbonyl groups).\n        *   **Vinylic Region:** The two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** suggest two protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). They are coupled to each other, appearing as doublets.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        1.  We have a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n        2.  We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        3.  We have two methyl groups. A methyl group on a benzene ring (a tolyl group) typically shows a signal around δ 2.3 ppm. This matches one of the methyl singlets (e.g., δ 2.31). The other methyl singlet (δ 2.28) is likely attached to the ketone, forming an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃). A methyl ketone proton signal is typically found around δ 2.1-2.4 ppm.\n        4.  Combining these pieces: We have a *p*-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-) and an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n        5.  The remaining pieces are the two vinylic protons (-CH=CH-).\n        6.  Let's assemble all the fragments: `p-tolyl` - `CH=CH` - `ketone-methyl`. This gives the structure: **CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃**.\n        7.  This structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, commonly known as *p*-methylbenzylideneacetone.\n        8.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR data:\n            *   **p-tolyl-CH₃:** Singlet, 3H (matches δ 2.31).\n            *   **Acetyl-CH₃:** Singlet, 3H (matches δ 2.28).\n            *   **p-tolyl aromatic protons:** Two doublets, 2H each (matches δ 7.08 and 7.71).\n            *   **Vinylic protons (-CH=CH-):** Two doublets, 1H each (matches δ 6.75 and 7.68). The large coupling constant expected for a trans double bond is consistent with a doublet splitting pattern.\n        9.  The deduced structure is fully consistent with all NMR data.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound X by Proposing a Reaction Mechanism**\n\n    *   The reaction converts Compound X (C11H12O) into 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This is an isomerization.\n    *   The starting materials listed in the options are all **vinyloxiranes** (also known as vinyl epoxides). The reaction of a vinyloxirane with a base like DABCO at high temperatures is a known rearrangement that forms α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n    *   **The Mechanism:** The accepted mechanism proceeds as follows:\n        a.  The base removes the most acidic proton, which is the allylic proton on the carbon attached to the epoxide ring.\n        b.  This generates a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n        c.  The carbanion undergoes a concerted rearrangement where the epoxide ring opens to form a stable conjugated enolate.\n        d.  The enolate tautomerizes to the final, more stable, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl product.\n        \n        **Generic Reaction:** `R-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-R'` → `R-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂R'`\n\n    *   **Testing the Options:** Let's apply this mechanism to the candidates:\n\n        *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** `[Ph-CH=C(CH₃)]-CH(O)CH₂`. This would rearrange to `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-C(=O)CH₃`. The product lacks a p-tolyl group and has no vinyl protons. Incorrect.\n\n        *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** `[Ph-CH=CH]-CH(O)CH-CH₃`. This would rearrange to `Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₂CH₃` (an ethyl ketone). The product has a phenyl group, not p-tolyl, and would show ethyl group signals (a quartet and a triplet), not a methyl singlet. Incorrect.\n\n        *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** `[p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH]-CH(O)CH₂`. Let's trace the mechanism:\n            1.  Deprotonation gives the anion: `[p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH]-C(-)(O)CH₂`.\n            2.  Rearrangement gives the enolate: `[p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH]-C(O⁻)=CH₂`.\n            3.  Tautomerization gives the final ketone: `[p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH]-C(=O)CH₃`.\n            This product is **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**, which perfectly matches the structure we deduced from the NMR spectra. **This is the correct answer.**\n\n        *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is a common name for 2-styryloxirane, `[Ph-CH=CH]-CH(O)CH₂`. The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula C₁₁H₁₂O for compound X. Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n\n    Compound X is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**, which undergoes a base-catalyzed rearrangement to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, the product whose NMR data was provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
