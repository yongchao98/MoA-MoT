    "This question asks to identify which of the given physical theories does not require a procedure called \"regularization\" to handle infinities that arise at high energies (or, equivalently, short distances). Let's analyze each option.\n\n### **1. Classical Electrodynamics (D)**\nThis theory describes the interactions of electric charges and currents using Maxwell's equations. In its classical form, if you treat charged particles like electrons as mathematical points with zero size, the energy of the particle's own electric field (its self-energy) becomes infinite. This is a short-distance/high-energy problem. To \"fix\" this, one might impose a small, non-zero radius for the particle, which is a form of regularization. However, this is generally seen as a sign that the classical theory is incomplete and breaks down at small scales, where quantum mechanics becomes important. The problem is properly addressed within Quantum Electrodynamics. So, classical theory does have an infinity problem at its high-energy limit that would require regularization to solve within the theory's own framework.\n\n### **2. Quantum Field Theories: QED (A) and QCD (C)**\nQuantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the quantum theory of electromagnetism, and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force. Both are Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) that describe particles as point-like excitations of fields.\n\nWhen calculating physical quantities in QFT, such as the probability of a particle scattering event, we use a method involving diagrams called Feynman diagrams. Some of these diagrams, known as \"loop diagrams,\" represent the effects of virtual particles. The calculations for these loops often involve integrating over all possible momenta of these virtual particles, up to infinity. These integrals frequently \"diverge\" (go to infinity) at the high-momentum (high-energy) end, a problem known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\".\n\nTo handle these infinite results and extract finite, meaningful physical predictions, physicists use a two-step process:\n1.  **Regularization**: The divergent integral is temporarily made finite by introducing a mathematical parameter called a \"regulator\" (e.g., an energy cutoff). This makes the infinities manageable.\n2.  **Renormalization**: The infinities, which are now controlled by the regulator, are systematically absorbed into the \"bare\" parameters of the theory (like the bare mass and charge of the particle), redefining them to match their experimentally observed values.\n\nBoth QED and QCD are \"renormalizable\" theories, meaning this procedure works consistently. However, the crucial point is that they both inherently contain these high-energy divergences and **absolutely require** the process of regularization and renormalization to make physical sense. Therefore, options A and C are incorrect.\n\n### **3. Superstring Theory (B)**\nSuperstring Theory is a candidate for a unified theory of physics, including quantum gravity. Unlike QFTs, the fundamental objects in string theory are not point-like particles but tiny, one-dimensional vibrating \"strings\".\n\nA key motivation for and feature of string theory is that it appears to be free of the ultraviolet (UV) divergences that plague QFTs. The extended nature of the strings, as opposed to points, naturally \"smears\" out interactions at very short distances. This smearing effect acts as a natural, built-in regulator, taming the high-energy behavior that would lead to infinities in a point-particle theory.\n\nAs a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory are expected to yield finite results without the need for the *ad hoc* procedure of regularization and renormalization used in QED and QCD. For this reason, string theory is often described as \"UV finite\". While a complete proof for all situations is still a subject of research, this property is a cornerstone of the theory.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n-   QED and QCD are point-particle quantum theories that require regularization.\n-   Classical Electrodynamics has a high-energy/short-distance infinity problem (self-energy) that requires regularization, highlighting the theory's limitations.\n-   Superstring Theory is specifically designed to resolve this problem by replacing point particles with strings, and is believed to be \"UV finite,\" thereby not requiring regularization for high-energy divergences.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the theory on the list that is proposed to never require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
