    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Annihilation Process:**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    The reaction is: $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, this is a standard way to say that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate the initial system as being at rest.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The kinetic energies are considered to be zero.\n        *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is effectively at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) of the system is zero.\n        *   $P_i = 0$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_{A^+} = m_{A^-} = m_A$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   From the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must be zero. This means they must fly apart in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the problem, we can assume that the total available energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Therefore, each particle $A$ will have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v_A$).\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Energy Principle:**\n    The total initial energy must equal the total final energy ($E_f$).\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n        $m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need the rest mass energy of a proton. A proton and an antiproton have the same mass. The standard value for the proton's rest mass energy is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Now, we substitute the known values into our energy conservation equation:\n        $2 \\times (938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 4 \\times (\\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV})$\n        $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n    *   Solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.56378$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44558}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.40889} = \\sqrt{0.59111}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c = 0.7688c$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (annihilation at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy is 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a particle physics problem involving annihilation and the conservation of energy. Here is the reasoning and the steps to solve it.\n\n**1. Understand the physical process**\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The annihilation products are two particles of type $A^{+}$ and two antiparticles of type $A^{-}$.\nThe reaction is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation)**\n*   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a standard approximation in such problems to mean its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the system is effectively at rest.\n*   The initial momentum of the system is therefore zero.\n*   The initial total energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times (938.27 \\text{ MeV}) = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation)**\n*   The system consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n*   Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. This implies the particles will fly apart from the point of annihilation.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the process, the available energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Therefore, each of the four particles will have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v_A$).\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**5. Equate Initial and Final Energies to Find the Velocity**\nUsing the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nNow, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nFinally, we find the velocity $v$ from the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v_A \\approx 0.7688c$.\n\n**6. Compare with the options**\nThe calculated value $v_A \\approx 0.77c$ matches option C.\n\nThe Python code generated in the first step confirmed this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (annihilation at rest)\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy is 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total energy of the initial particles (proton and antiproton) is converted into the total energy of the final particles (four A particles).\n\n2.  **Initial Energy Calculation:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible.
