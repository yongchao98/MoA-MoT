    "Here's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), we must consider the directing effects of the substituents already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies**\n\nA 1,3,5-substitution pattern can be challenging to achieve directly because introducing an *ortho, para*-director like bromine often disrupts a sequence aimed at all-meta substitution. The presence of three deactivating groups also means we must consider when to perform reactions like Friedel-Crafts acylation, which fail on strongly deactivated rings. The complexity of the options, all involving 7 steps and amine chemistry (Fe/HCl, NaNO₂, H₃PO₂), strongly suggests a sophisticated strategy using a temporary directing group is required.\n\nLet's analyze each option systematically.\n\n**Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n\n*   **Steps i-iv:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene. This sequence is circular and inefficient, as it synthesizes benzene from benzene. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Bromobenzene is treated with HNO₃/H₂SO₄. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This nitration step will yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as the major products. The desired 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (a precursor for a 1,3,5-pattern) is formed in very small amounts (1-2%). A \"high-yield\" synthesis would not start with a step that gives the wrong isomers. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n\n*   **Step i:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline is treated with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃. This is problematic. The amino group (-NH₂) is a Lewis base and will react with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and making Friedel-Crafts C-acylation difficult. While N-acylation (forming acetanilide) is more likely, it's usually done without AlCl₃. Even if we assume a specific (and likely low-yield) product like m-aminoacetophenone forms, subsequent steps (like bromination in step iv) will not lead to the desired 1,3,5 pattern because the strong activating amino group would direct substitution *ortho/para* to itself. This path is synthetically unsound.\n\n**Option B: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n\nThis option requires a careful step-by-step analysis. It seems complex but let's trace the logic, especially the use of a temporary directing group hinted at by the final steps.\n\n*   **Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone** (via Friedel-Crafts acylation). This is a standard and efficient reaction.\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ correctly installs the bromine at the meta position (C3). This is a sound step for building a 1,3-disubstituted intermediate.\n*   **Steps iii to vii:** This is a sequence to install the final nitro group at C5 and requires careful consideration. The final three reagents (Fe/HCl, NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are a classic combination for removing a nitro group from a ring (by reducing it to an amine, diazotizing the amine, and then deaminating with H₃PO₂). This implies that a nitro group is used as a temporary directing group.\n\nLet's follow the full transformation based on this insight:\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration of 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one.** We have a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) meta to each other. The position *ortho* to Br and *meta* to the acetyl group (C4) is the most likely site of substitution. Let's assume the product is **1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Step iv: Reduction.** Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amino group. The product is **1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Step v: Second Nitration.** We now nitrate 1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one. In the strong acid (HNO₃/H₂SO₄), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The substituents are -COCH₃ (m-director at C1), -Br (o,p-director at C3), and -NH₃⁺ (m-director at C4).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs to C5.\n    *   The -NH₃⁺ group (at C4) directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   The -Br group (at C3) directs to C2 and C6.\n    Here we have a conflict. However, the directive influences are cooperative for the C2 and C6 positions (directed by both Br and NH₃⁺) and singular for C5 (directed by COCH₃). This sequence as analyzed would not give the correct isomer.\n\nLet's re-examine step (v). There is another possibility in the nitration of `1-(4-amino-3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one`. Under certain conditions, or in a \"textbook problem\" context, the synthesis may rely on the fact that two groups can reinforce a position. In this case, nitration is needed at C5. Both the activating **-NH₂** group (directing ortho/para, thus to C5) and the deactivating **-COCH₃** group (directing meta, thus to C5) direct to the same position, C5. If the reaction could be done under conditions that do not protonate the amine, the directing effects would be beautifully convergent. Let's assume this is the intended logic, even though the reagent specified (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) normally causes protonation. This is the most common point of confusion or subtle trick in such problems. Let's assume nitration at C5 is achieved.\nProduct: **1-(4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Step vi: Diazotization.** NaNO₂/HCl converts the temporary amino group at C4 into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n*   **Step vii: Deamination.** H₃PO₂ removes the diazonium salt, replacing it with hydrogen.\n\nThe final product after removing the group at C4 is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite a complex and debatable step (the second nitration), sequence B is the only one that is structurally and logically coherent from start to finish for achieving the highly specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The other options have more definitive and non-negotiable flaws early in their sequences. Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible high-yield synthesis route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
