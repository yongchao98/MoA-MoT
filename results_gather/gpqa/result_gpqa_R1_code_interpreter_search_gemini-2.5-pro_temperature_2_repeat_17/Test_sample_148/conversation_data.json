    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information piece by piece:**\n    *   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptide. Peptides are made of amino acids linked by amide (peptide) bonds.\n    *   **Â¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two peaks for a single alpha-proton. An alpha-proton is the proton on the alpha-carbon of an amino acid residue. Having two peaks for what should be one proton means that this proton exists in two distinct chemical environments.\n        *   Similar chemical shifts: The two environments are structurally similar but not identical.\n        *   Roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H): The two species giving rise to these peaks are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   Not spin-spin coupling: This rules out a simple explanation for peak splitting (like a doublet, triplet, etc.). The two peaks are singlets (or whatever their expected pattern is, duplicated).\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Elevated temperature: This is a key detail. Some processes, like the interconversion of conformers, can be accelerated by heat. If the peaks are still separate at high temperatures, it implies a significant energy barrier between the two species.\n        *   Two clearly defined peaks: This confirms the presence of two different species that can be physically separated by liquid chromatography.\n        *   Equal intensities: This reinforces the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   Same mass spectrum: This is crucial. It means the two species have the exact same molecular formula and molecular weight.\n        *   Mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule: This tells us we are not looking at a contaminant with a different chemical formula (like a precursor or a side product with a different structure).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the provided options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This means an extra amino acid was added. For example, instead of Gly-Ala, the product is Gly-Ala-Ala.\n        *   This would result in a molecule with a higher mass.\n        *   The MS data shows that both peaks have the *same mass* as the *expected molecule*, not a higher mass.\n        *   Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and mass but different spatial arrangements. Crucially, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they have different properties, diastereoisomers give different NMR spectra. A specific proton, like an alpha-proton, will be in a different electronic environment in each diastereomer, leading to two distinct peaks. This fits the observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This would lead to two peaks in the LC. This fits the observation. Since they have the same formula, they will have the same mass spectrum. This also fits.\n        *   **How could they form in a peptide?**\n            1.  **Cis/trans isomerism:** The amide bond in a peptide has partial double-bond character, which restricts rotation. This can lead to *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are diastereomers of each other (specifically, a type of atropisomer). While the *trans* form is usually highly favored, for bonds preceding a proline residue (X-Pro), the energy difference is small, and significant amounts of both *cis* and *trans* isomers can coexist at equilibrium, often in nearly equal ratios. The barrier to rotation is high, meaning they interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale (giving separate peaks) and can often be separated by LC, even at elevated temperatures. This is a very common phenomenon.\n            2.  **Racemic starting material:** If the synthesis used a racemic amino acid (a 50:50 mix of D and L forms) and coupled it to an existing chiral part of the peptide, it would produce a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. For example, L-Ala + D/L-Phe -> L-Ala-D-Phe + L-Ala-L-Phe. These are diastereomers.\n        *   This option is highly consistent with all observations.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. A 50:50 mixture is called a racemic mixture.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical NMR spectra. You would see only one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Enantiomers cannot be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. They would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Both the NMR and LC data contradict this option. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor (starting material) would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product.\n        *   The MS data shows two peaks with the *same mass*, and this mass matches the *expected product*. This directly rules out contamination by a precursor.\n        *   Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence (two NMR peaks, two LC peaks, same mass for both peaks corresponding to the target molecule) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The most likely chemical reason for this in a peptide is the presence of *cis* and *trans* isomers around an amide bond, which are a type of diastereomer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
