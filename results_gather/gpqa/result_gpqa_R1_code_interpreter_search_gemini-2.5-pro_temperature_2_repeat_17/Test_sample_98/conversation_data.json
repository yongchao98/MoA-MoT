    "**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a hallmark of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns reported in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. For complex molecules with multiple sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes multiplicative (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n*   **Given Signals:**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n*   **Interpretation of Splitting Patterns:**\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different sets of protons:\n        *   One proton (1H) causing the doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent protons (2H) causing the triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Three equivalent protons (3H) causing the quartet (q) splitting.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton responsible for this signal must be adjacent to three different sets of protons:\n        *   One proton (1H) causing the doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent protons (2H) causing the first triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Another set of two equivalent protons (2H) causing the second triplet (t) splitting.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce these specific splitting patterns for its protons. The protons on chiral centers (`CH`) are the most likely candidates for such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C4 (1H, gives doublet) and CH₂ on C2 (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match.\n    *   H on C4: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the six protons of the two methyl groups (6H, gives septet). The splitting is a **doublet of septets**. This does not match.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(2)(C₂H₅)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C2 (1H, gives doublet), the CH₂ on C4 (2H, gives triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the signals.\n    *   H on C2: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This structure has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it's not the correct answer.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(2)(CH₃)-COOH(1)`\n    *   H on C2: Neighbors are H on C3 (1H, gives doublet) and the three protons of the C2-methyl group (3H, gives quartet). The splitting is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This does not match.\n    *   H on C3: Neighbors are H on C2 (1H, gives doublet) and the CH₂ on C4 (2H, gives triplet). The splitting is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n    The chemical formula is best interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid. Let's verify this interpretation.\n    `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-...` means a `sec-butyl` group fragment: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`.\n    The full structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    Let's number the carbon chain from the carboxylic acid (C1):\n    `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    Now, let's analyze the protons on the two chiral centers, C3 and C4.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton (`H-C3`) is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C4 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons on C2 (2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The two protons of its own ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → gives another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting splitting pattern for the proton at C3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton (`H-C4`) is coupled to:\n        *   The proton on C3 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons on C5 (2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The three protons of its own methyl group (3H) → gives a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   The resulting splitting pattern for the proton at C4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, has two protons with the exact complex splitting patterns (dtq and dtt) described in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
