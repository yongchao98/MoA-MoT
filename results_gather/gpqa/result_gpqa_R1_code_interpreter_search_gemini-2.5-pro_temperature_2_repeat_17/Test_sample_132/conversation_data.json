    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-):\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical species in the solution:**\n    *   `KH2PO4` is a salt that dissociates completely in water to form potassium ions (`K+`) and dihydrogen phosphate ions (`H2PO4-`).\n    *   `Na2HPO4●2H2O` is a hydrated salt that dissociates completely in water to form sodium ions (`Na+`), hydrogen phosphate ions (`HPO4^2-`), and water molecules.\n    *   Therefore, the solution initially contains a mixture of the weak acid `H2PO4-` and its conjugate base `HPO4^2-`. This constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is V = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of `H2PO4-` from `KH2PO4`:\n        *   Molar mass of `KH2PO4` = 136.09 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles.\n        *   Concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Moles of `HPO4^2-` from `Na2HPO4●2H2O`:\n        *   Molar mass of `Na2HPO4●2H2O` = 177.99 g/mol.\n        *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles.\n        *   Concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:**\n    *   The pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which involves `H2PO4-` and `HPO4^2-`.\n    *   The equilibrium reaction is: `H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-`\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is `Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8`.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: `Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]`.\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: `[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])`.\n    *   Since the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are significant and the Ka is small, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations with the initial concentrations we calculated.\n    *   `[H+] ≈ (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion, `PO4^3-`, is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, `HPO4^2-`.\n    *   The equilibrium reaction is: `HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-`\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is `Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12`.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: `Ka3 = ([H+][PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]`.\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for `[PO4^3-]`: `[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])`.\n    *   Using the values calculated in the previous steps:\n        *   `[PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)`.\n        *   `[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24 x 10^-7 M`.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\n# Given values\nV = 0.200  # Volume in L\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial molar concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / V\n\nmoles_HPO4 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4 = moles_HPO4 / V\n\n# Step 2: Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4 = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is: {conc_PO4:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is: 6.24e-07 M\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (`PO4^3-`).\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:** First, we need to determine the molar concentrations of the two salts dissolved in the solution.\n    *   Volume of the solution: V = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   `KH2PO4` dissociates into `K+` and `H2PO4-`.\n        *   Moles of `H2PO4-` = (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 moles\n        *   Concentration of `H2PO4-` = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = **0.03674 M**\n    *   `Na2HPO4●2H2O` dissociates into `2Na+` and `HPO4^2-`.\n        *   Moles of `HPO4^2-` = (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 moles\n        *   Concentration of `HPO4^2-` = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = **0.02809 M**\n\n2.  **Determine the pH and [H+] of the Buffer:** The solution contains a weak acid (`H2PO4-`) and its conjugate base (`HPO4^2-`), which forms a buffer system. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by `Ka2`.\n    *   Equilibrium: `H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-`\n    *   Equilibrium constant expression: `Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]`\n    *   We can rearrange the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka expression to find the hydrogen ion concentration, `[H+]`.\n    *   `[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])`\n    *   `[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)`\n    *   `[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Concentration:** Now we can find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (`PO4^3-`) using the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by `Ka3`.\n    *   Equilibrium: `HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-`\n    *   Equilibrium constant expression: `Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `[PO4^3-]`:\n    *   `[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])`\n    *   `[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)`\n    *   `[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.236 x 10^-7 M`\n\nRounding the result gives 6.24 x 10^-7 M, which corresponds to option C.\n\nThe Python code executed in the background confirms this calculation:\n`The concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4^3-] is: 6.24e-07 M`\n\n<<<C>>>"
