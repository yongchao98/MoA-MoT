    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reagents, A and B.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the carbonyl carbon. This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by sodium cyanide (NaCN), acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   The pi bond of the carbonyl group (C=O) breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated (gain an H⁺) to form the final neutral product, the cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ ---> CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n\n3.  **Determine the role and identity of reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to complete the reaction.\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: This represents an acidic aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water) and is an excellent source of protons. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is a reagent used to form bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones. It is not used to provide the proton in a cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This process is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**. The rest of the molecule (the large organic scaffold) remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (H₂O), which is indicated in the problem.\n    *   The reaction is typically very slow and must be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. It often requires heating as well.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄), the nitrile is protonated, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. This proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH), the hydroxide ion attacks the nitrile carbon. This also proceeds through an amide intermediate to form a carboxylate salt, which is then protonated in a final acidic workup step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine the role and identity of reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B must act as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is not an effective or standard reagent for this transformation. A strong acid is required for efficient hydrolysis.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, the reagent **A** must be **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, the reagent **B** must be **HCl**.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n\nA) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\nB) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\nC) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\nD) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n\nThe correct combination is found in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
