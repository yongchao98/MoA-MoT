    "*   **Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two or more interconvertible constitutional isomers, usually involving the migration of a proton. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom attached to an alpha-carbon, which is the carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This alpha-carbon must be sp³ hybridized.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the given compounds:\n        1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone)**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups opposite each other. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized and do not have the characteristics required for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n        2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons is sp³ hybridized and is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (-CH₂-). The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the given compounds:\n        1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n            *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n                1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n                2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n                3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n                4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n            *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism** (it has two enantiomers, R and S).\n\n        2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n            *   The molecule has a center of inversion symmetry in the middle of the C=C double bond.\n            *   It has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n            *   Molecules with a center of inversion are achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Determination**:\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
