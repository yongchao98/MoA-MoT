    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm3\n*   Final Volume (V2) = Initial Volume + Volume of water added = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3\n\nUsing the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n*   M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\n*   M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3\n*   M2 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Titration Reaction and Initial Moles**\n\nThe reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH, a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, a strong base) is:\nCH3COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH3COONa (aq) + H2O (l)\n\nLet's find the initial moles of acetic acid in the 40.00 cm3 solution:\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = **0.001 mol**\n\n### **Step 3: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   Moles of NaOH added = 0.25 × Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COONa formed = 0.00025 mol (this is the conjugate base, A⁻)\n*   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol (this is the weak acid, HA)\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\nNow, substitute the molar ratio into the equation (since they are in the same volume, the ratio of moles is equal to the ratio of concentrations):\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n*   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477\n*   pH ≈ 4.253\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 4: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH3COONa), in water. The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) will hydrolyze, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\nCH3COO⁻ (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ CH3COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.\n*   Moles of CH3COO⁻ formed = Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol\n*   Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3\n*   Total volume of solution = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L\n*   Concentration of CH3COO⁻ [A⁻] = Moles / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\nNext, we calculate the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion:\n*   Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 °C)\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n\nAssuming [CH3COOH] = [OH⁻] = x, and the initial concentration of [CH3COO⁻] is 0.02 M:\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nSince Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02:\n5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\nx² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\nx = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\nNow, calculate pOH and then pH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05 # M\ninitial_acid_vol = 20.00 / 1000 # L\ndilution_water_vol = 20.00 / 1000 # L\nNaOH_conc = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\n# Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution\nfinal_acid_vol = initial_acid_vol + dilution_water_vol\ninitial_moles_acid = initial_acid_conc * initial_acid_vol\ndiluted_acid_conc = initial_moles_acid / final_acid_vol\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% titration ---\n# At 25% titration, we have a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n# pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# The ratio of concentrations [A-]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of moles.\n# moles of A- = 0.25 * initial_moles_acid\n# moles of HA = 0.75 * initial_moles_acid\n# Ratio = (0.25 * initial_moles_acid) / (0.75 * initial_moles_acid) = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# At the equivalence point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate).\n# The solution contains only CH3COONa.\n# First, find the total volume at the equivalence point.\nmoles_NaOH_at_equiv = initial_moles_acid\nvol_NaOH_at_equiv = moles_NaOH_at_equiv / NaOH_conc\ntotal_vol_at_equiv = final_acid_vol + vol_NaOH_at_equiv\n\n# Second, find the concentration of the acetate ion ([A-]).\nmoles_A_minus_at_equiv = initial_moles_acid\nconc_A_minus_at_equiv = moles_A_minus_at_equiv / total_vol_at_equiv\n\n# Third, calculate Kb for the acetate ion's hydrolysis.\nKb = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# Fourth, calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH-] from hydrolysis: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-].  Solving for [OH-]: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-]).\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_at_equiv)\n\n# Fifth, calculate pOH and then pH.\npOH_at_equiv = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_equiv = 14 - pOH_at_equiv\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations have been performed.\n1.  The initial 0.05 M acetic acid solution was diluted to a concentration of 0.025 M.\n2.  The pKa of acetic acid was calculated as -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73.\n3.  The pH at 25% titration was determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.25/0.75) = 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.26.\n4.  The pH at the equivalence point was determined by considering the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.02 M in a total volume of 50.00 cm³. The Kb was calculated, and from that, the [OH⁻] was found, leading to a pOH and finally a pH of approximately 8.52.\n\nThe Python code executed these same calculations and provided the results:\n*   pH at 25% titration: 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThese results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
