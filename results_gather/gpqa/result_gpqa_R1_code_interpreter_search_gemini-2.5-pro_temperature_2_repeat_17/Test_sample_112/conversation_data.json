    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic spectroscopic feature. A broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer, where the broadness is caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretching vibration, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is a direct confirmation of the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogen atoms attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺. Its mass is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment is very common for carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From FTIR and Mass Spec, we have strong evidence for a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**. This functional group contains two oxygen atoms and a C=O double bond.\n    *   From FTIR and ¹H NMR, we have confirmed the presence of a **C=C double bond**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   A C=C double bond contributes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) contributes another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total **Degree of Unsaturation of 2**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    Let's calculate the DoU for each of the proposed chemical formulas using the formula: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a molecular formula like 'C6H10O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    C = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str).group(1))\n    H = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str).group(1))\n    # Formula for DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 - X/2 + 1\n    # For CH O compounds, it simplifies to C - H/2 + 1\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H12O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Analysis of options based on a required DoU of 2 and the presence of 2 Oxygen atoms:\")\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    num_oxygens = 2 if \"O2\" in formula else 1 if \"O\" in formula and \"O2\" not in formula else 0\n    \n    match_dou = \"Yes\" if dou == 2 else \"No\"\n    match_oxygen = \"Yes\" if num_oxygens == 2 else \"No\"\n    \n    print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}:\")\n    print(f\"  - Calculated DoU = {dou} (Required: 2 -> Match: {match_dou})\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of Oxygens = {num_oxygens} (Required: 2 -> Match: {match_oxygen})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n```\nExecution Results:\n```\nAnalysis of options based on a required DoU of 2 and the presence of 2 Oxygen atoms:\nOption A) C6H10O2:\n  - Calculated DoU = 2 (Required: 2 -> Match: Yes)\n  - Number of Oxygens = 2 (Required: 2 -> Match: Yes)\n--------------------\nOption B) C6H12O:\n  - Calculated DoU = 1 (Required: 2 -> Match: No)\n  - Number of Oxygens = 1 (Required: 2 -> Match: No)\n--------------------\nOption C) C6H10O:\n  - Calculated DoU = 2 (Required: 2 -> Match: Yes)\n  - Number of Oxygens = 1 (Required: 2 -> Match: No)\n--------------------\nOption D) C6H12O2:\n  - Calculated DoU = 1 (Required: 2 -> Match: No)\n  - Number of Oxygens = 2 (Required: 2 -> Match: Yes)\n--------------------\n```\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 2. It has two oxygen atoms. This is fully consistent with a molecule containing one C=C bond and one carboxylic acid group.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 1. This DoU is too low, and it only has one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 2. While the DoU is correct, it only has one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 1. The DoU is too low. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which would not have a C=C bond or vinyl-hydrogens.\n\nBased on the analysis, only C₆H₁₀O₂ fits all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Final Conclusion:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Evidence:**\n    *   Broad peak ~3000 cm⁻¹ + Strong peak ~1700 cm⁻¹ → **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH)** group. This requires **two oxygen atoms** and accounts for **one degree of unsaturation** (from the C=O bond).\n    *   Strong peak ~1650 cm⁻¹ → **Alkene (C=C)** double bond. This accounts for a **second degree of unsaturation**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Evidence:**\n    *   Vinyl-hydrogens → Confirms the presence of the **Alkene (C=C)** double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spec Evidence:**\n    *   Fragment at m/z = 45 → Consistent with the **[COOH]⁺ fragment**, further supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid containing a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   This requires **two oxygen atoms** and a total **degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the options (as confirmed by the code execution):**\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = **2**. This matches all criteria.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** Has 1 oxygen. DoU = 1. This is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₀O:** Has 1 oxygen. DoU = 2. This is incorrect (not enough oxygen).\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 1. This is incorrect (not enough unsaturation).\n\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the collected data is **C₆H₁₀O₂**. An example of such a compound would be hex-2-enoic acid or 4-methylpent-2-enoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
