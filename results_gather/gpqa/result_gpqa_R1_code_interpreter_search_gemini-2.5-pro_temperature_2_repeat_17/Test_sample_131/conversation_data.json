    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR spectral data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that each compound has aromatic protons.\n    *   The protons within each molecule must be chemically equivalent to each other to appear as a single singlet.\n    *   The two compounds are different, so their aromatic singlets appear at slightly different chemical shifts.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds and tells us that each compound contributes the same number of aromatic protons to its respective signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals being singlets indicates that the protons are not coupled to any neighboring non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of methyl groups (-CH3) attached to a quaternary carbon, like on an aromatic ring.\n    *   We need to find a combination of two compounds that, when mixed 1:1, will produce three methyl signals in this specific 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the structures and predict the 1H NMR spectra for each option:**\n\nFirst, let's verify the molecular formula C10H14 for all candidate compounds.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. All three fit.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. This also fits.\n\nNow let's predict the spectrum for each compound, paying close attention to symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. However, the ethyl groups would show coupling. We would expect a triplet for the -CH3 protons and a quartet for the -CH2- protons. Since the problem states all signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.** This also eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This gives **two aliphatic singlets (one for 6H, one for 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Methyl protons: The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the plane of symmetry). The methyl group at C5 is also unique (on the plane of symmetry). This gives **three aliphatic singlets (one for 6H, one for 3H, one for 3H)**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixture options:**\n\nWe need to find the pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, matches the observed spectrum. We already confirmed that any 1:1 pair of the three tetramethylbenzenes will give two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio, as they each have one 2H aromatic singlet. The key is to match the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined: This would produce **four** aliphatic singlets. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Combined: This produces **three** aliphatic singlets, with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Aliphatic signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined: Even with a coincidental overlap of one 6H signal from each compound, this would result in four signals with integrations (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
