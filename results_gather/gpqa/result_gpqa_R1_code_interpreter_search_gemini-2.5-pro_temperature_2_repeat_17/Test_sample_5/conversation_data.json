    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often best to work in a coordinate system where the potential is separable. Let's convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n2.  **Coordinate Transformation:**\n    The standard relations between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\n    Since x = r cos(θ), we can replace `r cos(θ)` with `x`:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    Now, group the terms with x and y:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n4.  **Recognize the Separable Potential:**\n    The potential in Cartesian coordinates is now a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where:\n    *   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n    *   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n    This is the potential of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is separable. The total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y dimensions, E = E_x + E_y. We need to solve the 1D Schrödinger equation for each dimension.\n    The standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2, and its energy spectrum is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy for the x-dimension:**\n    We compare V_x(x) with the standard QHO potential form:\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2\n    Solving for ω_x:\n    m(ω_x)^2 = 4k\n    (ω_x)^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-dimension are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n7.  **Calculate the Energy for the y-dimension:**\n    Similarly, we compare V_y(y) with the standard QHO potential form:\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2 = 1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2\n    Solving for ω_y:\n    m(ω_y)^2 = k\n    (ω_y)^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-dimension are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of the individual energies:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    Factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option B.\n    A) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
