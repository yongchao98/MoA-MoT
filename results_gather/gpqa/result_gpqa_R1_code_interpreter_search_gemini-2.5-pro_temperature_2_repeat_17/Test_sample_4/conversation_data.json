    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the normalized eigenvector.\n\n**1. Define the Operators**\n\nThe components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ are given in terms of the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, often denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n**2. Determine the Operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nWe need to find the operator representing the spin projection along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$. This is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in spherical coordinates is given by $(\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (from the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (from the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n\nSince $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The unit vector becomes:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we compute the dot product:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\sin\\theta)P_x + (0)P_y + (\\cos\\theta)P_z$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\sin\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, with the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the $\\hbar/2$ factor from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**4. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components is 1.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$\n\nSubstitute $b$ in terms of $a$. We can choose $a$ to be real for simplicity.\n$a^2 + (a \\tan(\\theta/2))^2 = 1$\n$a^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$a^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$a^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n$a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (Choosing the positive real root)\n\nNow, find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect form and trigonometric arguments.\n*   B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless states, and these values are constant.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect. Contains $\\hbar$ and incorrect constants.\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our derived result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
