    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is maintained at a constant value, which we can take as V = 0. We need to find the total electrostatic potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, which are created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charge on the sphere, can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced charge with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the surface of the sphere) is met.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is located along the same line as the original charge, at a distance `b` from the center. The standard results for these are:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    These values ensure that the potential created by both `q` and `q'` sums to zero at any point on the surface of the sphere (where the distance from the center is `r=R`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** There are two common and reliable methods to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n    **Method 1: Work Done to Assemble the System**\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` against the electric force from the sphere. This force is due to the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this force is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\n    *   Let the real charge `q` be at an arbitrary position `x` from the center (`x >= R`).\n    *   The image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The force on `q` is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance between them)^2`.\n    *   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R) / (x * (x - R^2/x)^2) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    *   The work done by an external agent to move the charge from infinity to `d` is `W = -integral(F(x) dx)` from `infinity` to `d`.\n    *   `U = W = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n    *   `U = ∫[d to ∞] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve this integral, let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, which means `x dx = du/2`.\n    *   The limits of integration become: when `x=d`, `u = d^2-R^2`; when `x->∞`, `u->∞`.\n    *   `U = -k * q^2 * R * ∫[d^2-R^2 to ∞] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n    *   `U = -(k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/u ]` from `d^2-R^2` to `∞`.\n    *   `U = -(k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ (-1/∞) - (-1/(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n    *   `U = -(k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ 0 + 1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the `U = (1/2) qV` formula**\n    A more direct method uses the formula for energy `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n    *   In our original system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The sphere has V=0, so it does not contribute to this sum.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_other`, where `V_other` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere.\n    *   The potential from the induced charge on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   So, we need to find the potential created by `q'` at the location of `q` (which is at distance `d` from the center).\n    *   `V_other = V_q'(at d) = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   `V_other = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_other = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both methods yield the same result. The energy is negative, which makes physical sense as the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. The system is in a lower energy state than when the charge is at infinity (U=0).\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has R²)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n    C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
