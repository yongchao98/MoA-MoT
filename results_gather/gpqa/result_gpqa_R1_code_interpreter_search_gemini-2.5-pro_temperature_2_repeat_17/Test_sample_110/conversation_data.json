    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition (also known as a 1,4-conjugate addition). In this reaction, a nucleophile (a Michael donor) adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n2.  **Identify the reactants and their roles:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will remove an acidic α-proton from this ketone to form an enolate ion, which is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the α,β-unsaturated ester that will be attacked by the enolate.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). It's a strong, sterically hindered base.\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to find the α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O). The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, so it has no α-protons. It is a quaternary carbon.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 has a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the single available α-proton at the C6 position to form the enolate.\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate anion, with the negative charge localized primarily on the C6 carbon, acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. The β-carbon is the CH₂ group in CH₂=CH-COOEt.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate, which is then protonated during workup to yield the final neutral product.\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring where the C6 carbon is now bonded to both its original methyl group and the new chain derived from ethyl acrylate (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`).\n    *   To name this product, we must identify the principal functional group. The ester (`-COOEt`) has higher priority than the ketone (`C=O`). Therefore, the parent name will be `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules for naming a cyclic substituent, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as position 1. So, the original C6 of the ketone ring is now C1' of the substituent.\n    *   We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The ketone group (original C1) is now at C2' (`2-oxo`). The ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) are at C3' (`3-ethyl`, `3-methyl`). The original methyl group at C6 is now at C1' (`1-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these parts, the name of the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name for product A is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis result eliminates options A and B.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael addition.\n2.  **Identify the reactants and their roles:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group makes the protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon) acidic. The base, KOH, deprotonates this carbon to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n3.  **Formation of the Carbanion:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane:\n        `CH₃CH₂C**H**₂NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  [CH₃CH₂**CH**NO₂]⁻ + H₂O`\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the CH group bonded to the methyl group (`CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN`).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃) - CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, the principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(CH₃)(C3)-CH(NO₂)(C4)-CH₂(C5)-CH₃(C6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   We identify the substituents and their positions: there is a `methyl` group on C3 and a `nitro` group on C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name for product B is: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis result eliminates options A and C.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given choices:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct combination of products is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
