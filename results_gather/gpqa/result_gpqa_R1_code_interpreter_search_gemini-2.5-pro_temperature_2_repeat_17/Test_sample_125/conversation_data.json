    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single, defined stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), with the (S) configuration. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride), 2. Acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral, and its two faces (*re* and *si*) are diastereotopic.\n    *   Hydride attack on the two diastereotopic faces is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct, chiral products are formed. These two products are diastereomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride), 2. Acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** Excess NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses achiral reagents, this pair is formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. It is therefore a meso compound. Its mirror image, (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, is identical and superimposable on it.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final combined mixture contains five distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, producing a single peak. This is **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, producing another peak. This is **1 peak** for the meso compound.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular formulas, functional groups, and polarities. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will be well-separated from the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** We have four chromatographically distinct species:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can separate all different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved.\n    *   The five distinct stereoisomers are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer, will be separated)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer, will be separated on a chiral column)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer, will be separated)\n*   **Total Chiral-Phase Peaks:** Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers, the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
