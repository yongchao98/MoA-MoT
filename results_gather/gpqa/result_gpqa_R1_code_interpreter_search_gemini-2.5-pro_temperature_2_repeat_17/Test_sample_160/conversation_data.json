    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths within the same environment (the TEM sample chamber):\n    *   **λ1**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. This is a standard kinetic theory of gases problem.\n    *   **λ2**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Mean Free Path (MFP) Formulas:** The formula for mean free path depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n    *   **For gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1):** The particles are all of similar mass and are in thermal motion, described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The mean free path is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (gas-gas).\n        *   The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the molecules.\n\n    *   **For high-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules (λ2):** The electrons are projectiles with a very high, uniform velocity, much greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. In this case, the target gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary. The formula for the MFP simplifies to:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        Where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule (electron-gas).\n        *   Note the absence of the `√2` factor because the targets are essentially stationary relative to the projectile.\n\n3.  **Establish the Ratio between λ2 and λ1:** We can find the relationship between the two MFPs by dividing the equation for λ2 by the equation for λ1:\n    (λ2 / λ1) = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    The number density `n` cancels out, leaving:\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    *   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecule's electron cloud. For a collision to occur, the two molecules, which are relatively large objects, must come close enough to interact.\n    *   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Cross-Section):** This describes the probability of a high-energy (1000 keV) electron scattering off a gas molecule. The electron is a point-like particle moving at nearly the speed of light. Its interaction with the gas molecule is an electromagnetic event (scattering from the nucleus or the electron cloud). For high-energy projectiles, the scattering cross-section is known to decrease significantly with increasing energy. A very fast electron has a low probability of being deflected; it can easily \"zip through\" the atomic structure. Therefore, the effective target area presented by the gas molecule to the electron is much smaller than the target area it presents to another molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The gas-gas kinetic cross-section is significantly larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section. Thus, `σ_gg > σ_eg`, which means the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number greater than 1.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have the relationship: λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg).\n    *   We know `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   We know `(σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1`.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 must be greater than 1.414 * 1.\n    *   So, we can confidently state: **λ2 / λ1 > 1.414**, or **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: This is consistent with our finding that λ2 is greater than 1.414 * λ1. If a value is greater than 1.414, it is also greater than 1.22. This statement must be true.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1: This is false, as it sets an upper bound of 1.22, while our calculated lower bound is ~1.414.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n\nThe only statement that holds true based on the physics is A. The mean free path of an electron in the gas is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n\n<<<A>>>"
