    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in molecules that are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as seen in some biphenyls and allenes). A molecule that has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls normally have free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings, which allows the molecule to adopt a planar (achiral) conformation. However, in this specific molecule, all four positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups (two nitro groups, -NO2, and two dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH3). These bulky groups clash with each other, severely restricting the rotation around the single bond. This forces the two rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting fixed, non-planar conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and is optically active.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure can be written as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        *   -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        *   -COOCH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since the carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center** (or asymmetric carbon). Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is optically active.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. This molecule has an element of symmetry. It possesses a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond, and it also has a plane of symmetry that contains the central carbonyl C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is **achiral**. Therefore, benzophenone is not optically active.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with a *trans* geometry about the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a **center of inversion** (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is **achiral**. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\n<<<A>>>"
