    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and A respectively, generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The problem is about the electromagnetic potentials generated by a single moving point charge. This requires using the concept of *retarded potentials*, which account for the finite speed of light `c`. The potentials at an observation point `(\\vec{r}, t)` are determined not by the charge's current position and velocity, but by its position and velocity at an earlier time, `tr`, called the *retarded time*.\n\n2.  **Define Variables based on the Problem Statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `$\\vec{s}(t_r)`$: the position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `$\\vec{r}`$: the position of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time of observation.\n    *   `t_r`: the retarded time, when the signal (field) was emitted from the charge to reach `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`.\n    *   `$\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |\\vec{d}|`: the distance between the charge's retarded position and the observation point.\n    *   `$\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\Big|_{t=t_r}`$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   `c`, `$\\epsilon_o$`, `$\\mu_o$`: speed of light, permittivity of free space, and permeability of free space.\n\n3.  **The Retardation Condition:** The time it takes for the field to travel the distance `d` is `d/c`. Therefore, the observation time `t` and the retarded time `tr` are related by:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n    This is consistent with the problem's condition `t > tr`.\n\n4.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The retarded potentials for a continuous charge distribution $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n    For a single point charge `q` at position `$\\vec{s}(t)$` with velocity `$\\vec{v}(t)$`, these integrals evaluate to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key step in the evaluation is accounting for the change in the effective volume of the charge due to its motion relative to the observer during the propagation time. This introduces a correction factor in the denominator. The well-established results are:\n    \n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{ret}$\n    \n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{ret}$\n\n    where `$\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d` is the unit vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observer, and the `[ ]_ret` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `$\\vec{d}$`, `$\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the expressions to match the format of the options.\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n        To eliminate the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        Using the same logic for the vector potential:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n        Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    An important relation between V and A for a point charge can be seen here:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n    Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    (where `$\\vec{v}$` is the velocity at the retarded time).\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        This gives the scalar potential for a static charge (Coulomb's Law) and not a moving one. The denominator does not account for the relativistic effects of motion. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This expression for V matches our derived formula perfectly. The expression for A also matches our derived formula.\n\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n        The scalar potential is incorrect. The vector potential expression is also incorrect; it involves a scalar `$\\vec{v}^2$` which doesn't make sense dimensionally or physically for a vector potential.\n\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n        This has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-`. This corresponds to the *advanced potentials*, which would describe fields that exist before they are created, violating causality. Since the problem states `t > tr`, we are dealing with retarded (causal) potentials, so the sign must be `-`. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
