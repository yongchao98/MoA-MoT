    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactant and its Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this name to draw the structure and find its molecular formula.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so its carbon is designated as C1 on the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 carbons in the ring + 1 carbon in the -COOH group + 1 carbon in the -CHO group + 2 carbons in the -CH=CH2 group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2) -> 7 H\n    *   In the substituents: -COOH (1 H), -CHO (1 H), -CH=CH2 (3 H) -> 5 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens (H12)**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 oxygens in the -COOH group + 1 oxygen in the -CHO group = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Note: Oxygens do not affect the IHD calculation).\n\nFor the reactant C10H12O3:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the features that contribute to the IHD from the structure:\n*   One ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C double bond in the ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group: IHD = 1\nTotal IHD for the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**. This confirms our calculation.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   All C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   All C=O double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) will be fully reduced.\n*   The overall effect is the conversion of the molecule to its corresponding saturated alkane, preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n**4. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the reactant molecule:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe product will be a substituted cyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms remains the same (C10). All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are saturated with hydrogen. The resulting molecule is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\nThe chemical formula for a saturated alkane is CnH(2n+2). A molecule with one ring will have two fewer hydrogens, so its formula is CnH2n.\n\nSince the product has 10 carbon atoms and a single ring structure, its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow we calculate the IHD for the product with the formula C10H20.\n\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the structure of the product (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). The only feature contributing to the IHD is the presence of the ring itself. A single ring always corresponds to an IHD of 1. All other sources of unsaturation from the reactant have been eliminated by the reduction.\n\nInitial IHD = 5\nThe reduction removes four degrees of unsaturation:\n1.  C=C in the ring\n2.  C=C in the vinyl group\n3.  C=O in the carboxylic acid\n4.  C=O in the aldehyde\nFinal IHD = Initial IHD - 4 = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
