    "This problem asks for the minimum energy of a gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pair. This process, $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, is known as pair production. The lifetime of gamma-rays with energy above this threshold will be significantly limited due to the high probability of this interaction with the abundant CMB photons.\n\nHere is the reasoning to determine this threshold energy:\n\n1.  **Principle of the Calculation:** We use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum and Lorentz invariance. The process has a minimum energy requirement determined by the rest mass of the particles being created (an electron and a positron).\n\n2.  **Threshold Condition:** For the reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least the rest energy of the electron-positron pair. The electron and positron have the same rest mass, $m_e$.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The minimum required energy in the CM frame is $E_{CM, min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Invariance:** The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is invariant across all inertial reference frames. We can calculate $s$ in the laboratory frame (where the CMB is observed) and equate it to its value in the CM frame.\n    *   In the CM frame, at the threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest, so the total energy is $E_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$. The value of $s$ is the square of this energy: $s = (E_{CM, min})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n4.  **Calculation in the Laboratory Frame:** Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon be $p_\\gamma$ and $p_{CMB}$ respectively. Their energies are $E_\\gamma$ and $E_{CMB}$.\n    *   $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 = p_\\gamma^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    *   For photons (massless particles), $p^2=0$. Thus, $s = 2p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n    *   The dot product of the four-momenta is $p_\\gamma \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_\\gamma E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_\\gamma \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\n    *   In terms of energy and the angle $\\theta$ between the photons, this is $E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   So, $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Finding the Minimum Threshold Energy:** To find the lowest possible energy $E_\\gamma$ for this reaction to occur, we need to consider the most efficient interaction geometry. The CM energy is maximized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This happens for a head-on collision, where the photons travel in opposite directions ($\\theta = \\pi$ radians or 180Â°), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    *   For a head-on collision, $s = 2E_\\gamma E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$.\n\n6.  **Solving for the Gamma-Ray Energy:** Now, we equate the expressions for $s$ from the CM frame and the lab frame:\n    *   $(2m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n    *   $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 4E_\\gamma E_{CMB}$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:** We are given:\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    To compare with the given options, we convert this energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15}}{10^9} \\text{ GeV} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_\\gamma = 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value corresponds to option A. Any gamma-ray with energy above this threshold can undergo pair production with a CMB photon, which significantly shortens its travel distance (and thus lifetime) in the universe.\n\n<<<A>>>"
