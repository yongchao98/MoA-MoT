    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO).**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 8 - 9/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** The broad singlet for two protons is indicative of an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula (C8H9**N**O), this signal corresponds to a primary amino group (-NH2).\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal far downfield is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks), which confirms it's coupled to the aldehyde proton. Thus, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + NH2 + H (from CH2) + H (from CHO) gives C8H9NO. The structure is consistent with all data.\n\n    Startiing Material:\n    ```\n        NH2\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n      \\\\   //\n         |\n        CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **1. NaNO2 + HCl (0-5 °C):** This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+ Cl-).\n    The product is 4-(diazoniophenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n    ```\n      [N≡N]+ Cl-\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n      \\\\   //\n         |\n        CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **2. H2O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is treated with water and heated. This causes hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    ```\n        OH\n         |\n        / \\\n      ||   ||\n      \\\\   //\n         |\n        CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting an aldehyde with alpha-hydrogens (the CH2 group is alpha to the CHO group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is a classic self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe reaction happens between two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Let's denote Ar = 4-hydroxyphenyl. The reactant is Ar-CH2-CHO.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate (`[Ar-CH-CHO]-`). This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n    *   Aldol Adduct: `Ar-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar)-CHO`\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option **D**.\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with \"Heat\". This provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are removed.\n    *   `Ar-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `Ar-CH2-CH=C(Ar)-CHO`\n    *   Let's name this final condensation product. The main chain is a `but-2-enal`. There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group at position 2 and another at position 4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option **B**.\n\nSince the reaction conditions include heat, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product D) but will proceed to the more thermodynamically stable condensation product (product B), which benefits from extended conjugation between the phenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
