    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, so we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Principles**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay is equal to the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay is equal to the total momentum after the decay.\n\nThe decay reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n**2. Initial State (Before Decay)**\n\n*   The positive pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Its initial momentum is zero: $p_{\\pi^+} = 0$.\n*   Its initial total energy is its rest energy: $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Final State (After Decay)**\n\n*   The products are a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$).\n*   To conserve momentum, they must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be $p$.\n    $p_{\\mu^+} = p$ and $p_{\\nu} = p$.\n*   The total energy of the final state is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   The total energy of any particle is given by the relativistic formula: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\n**4. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Momentum:** $p_{\\pi^+} = 0 \\implies p_{\\mu^+} = p_{\\nu} = p$.\n\n*   **Energy:** $E_{\\pi^+} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n    Let's express the energies of the products:\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu$): Neutrinos are considered massless (or have negligible mass) in this context. So, $m_{\\nu} = 0$.\n        $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n        Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy: $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n**5. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe have the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nWe can substitute $pc = E_{\\nu}$:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nNow, we rearrange to solve for $E_{\\nu}$:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu})^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} + E_{\\nu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $E_{\\nu}^2$ terms cancel out:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nIsolate the term with $E_{\\nu}$:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n$E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nThis is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, $KE_{\\nu}$.\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n$m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# As derived, KE_nu = E_nu\nKE_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Now, find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) using energy conservation.\n# Total energy released (Q-value) is m_pi - m_mu\n# This energy is shared as kinetic energy between the products: KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu\n# Therefore, KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu) - KE_nu\nKE_mu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n-   **Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($\\nu$)**: ~29.8 MeV\n-   **Kinetic Energy of muon ($\\mu^+$)**: ~4.12 MeV\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical Principles\n\nThis problem involves a particle decay at rest. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the product particles are likely to be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay reaction is:\n$\\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\pi^+$ is the positive pion.\n*   $\\mu^+$ is the positive muon (an antimuon).\n*   $\\nu$ is a muon neutrino.\n\n### 2. State Initial Conditions\n\n*   The pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero ($p_{\\pi^+} = 0$).\n*   The total energy of the initial system is the rest energy of the pion, $E_{\\pi^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$.\n\nGiven data:\n*   Rest mass of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi^+}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu^+}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered to have zero rest mass ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero. The muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n\n*   Let the magnitude of the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$.\n*   Then, $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$. Let's call this common magnitude $p$.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nHere, $E_{\\mu^+}$ and $E_{\\nu}$ are the total relativistic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the massless neutrino ($\\nu$): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2} = pc$.\n\n### 5. Solve the Equations\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for energy into the conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nWe know that $pc = E_{\\nu}$, so we can substitute this to eliminate $p$:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $E_{\\nu}$:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of the square root:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu})^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} + E_{\\nu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $E_{\\nu}^2$ terms cancel out:\n$(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\nIsolate $E_{\\nu}$:\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$).\n\n### 6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies\n\n**a) Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\nUsing the formula derived above and the given values:\n$KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}{2 \\times 139.6 \\text{ MeV}}$\n$KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n$KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nRounding to one decimal place, $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV.\n\n**b) Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\nWe can find the total kinetic energy released in the decay, which is the difference in rest masses (the Q-value):\n$KE_{total} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 - m_{\\nu}c^2$\n$KE_{total} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 0 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two product particles:\n$KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu}$\n$33.9 \\text{ MeV} = KE_{\\mu^+} + 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nSolving for the muon's kinetic energy:\n$KE_{\\mu^+} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 4.1 \\text{ MeV}$\nA more precise calculation gives: $33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12$ MeV.\n\nSo, the kinetic energies are:\n*   Kinetic energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) = **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$) = **29.8 MeV**\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
