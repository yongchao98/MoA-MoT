    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand its structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring. Following IUPAC rules for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is at position 1. So, the carbonyl group is adjacent to the ring oxygen.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n\nThis structure is a **lactone**, which is a cyclic ester. Specifically, it's a six-membered lactone, also known as a δ-lactone. Lactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. A six-membered lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n\nThe precursor acid for this lactone is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\nHO-CH₂(⁵)-CH₂(⁴)-CH(Et)(³)-CH₂(²)-COOH(¹)\n\nThe chiral center in the product is at C4, which corresponds to C3 in the linear hydroxy acid precursor. During lactonization, the configuration of this chiral center is preserved.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's determine this structure:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: The main chain has a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which defines C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This indicates that at C5, there is an isobutoxy group (-OCH₂(CH₃)₂) and an oxo group (=O). This combination describes an isobutyl ester, -COO-iBu.\n*   Since the main chain is a pentanoic acid (5 carbons total), the structure must be:\n    HOOC(¹)-CH₂(²)-CH(Et)(³)-CH₂(⁴)-COO-iBu(⁵)\n\nThis molecule is a **mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid** (3-ethylpentanedioic acid). It has two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an ester (-COO-iBu) at the other. The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. Its key chemical property for this problem is its **chemoselectivity**. LiBH₄ reduces esters to primary alcohols more readily than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COO-iBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group is left intact.\n        A [HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu] → [HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH]\n    2.  The product of this reduction is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    3.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** In this entire sequence, the bonds to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, which becomes C4 in the product) are not affected. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration**.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent famous for its high chemoselectivity. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reacts very slowly with esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group is left intact.\n        B [HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu] → [HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu]\n    2.  The product of this reduction is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**.\n    3.  The acid workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular **transesterification**. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBu-OH) and forming the cyclic ester (lactone). This reaction forms a 6-membered ring (O, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 of the original chain).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in any bond-making or bond-breaking steps. The reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration**.\n*   **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A is the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Starting Material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
