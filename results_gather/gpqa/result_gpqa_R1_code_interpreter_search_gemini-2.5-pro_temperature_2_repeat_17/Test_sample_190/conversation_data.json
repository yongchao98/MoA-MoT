    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n*   This molecule is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   Position 1 has a ketone group (C=O).\n*   Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   Position 5 has an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The most acidic proton in the starting material is the one on the hydroxyl group of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18), which is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether. The -CH2OH group is \"protected\" as a -CH2OBn group.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unchanged.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 reacts with the hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a C=N-NH-Ts bond via a condensation reaction (loss of a water molecule).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of strong base (n-BuLi). The base first deprotonates the N-H proton, and then a second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon α (adjacent) to the C=N bond (i.e., at C2 or C6). This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and a toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is typically quenched with a proton source (like H₂O or NH₄Cl solution in the workup step) to give an alkene.\n*   Essentially, this reaction converts a ketone into an alkene by first making the tosylhydrazone. The C=O group is effectively replaced with a C=C double bond. The double bond will form between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent carbons (C2 or C6). The less-substituted alkene is usually the major product.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule now has two C=C double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain. The 1,3-relationship between the two substituent groups is maintained.\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced (hydrogenated) to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The Pd/C catalyst with H₂ is also a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl group is broken, and the oxygen is protonated, converting the ether back into an alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between these groups is preserved from the starting material.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** If we consider the molecule as a substituted methanol, the parent structure is `cyclohexylmethanol`. The isopropyl group is a substituent on the cyclohexane ring. Numbering the ring from the carbon attached to the `-CH₂OH` group as C1, the isopropyl group is at the C3 position. Therefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches our derived structure for product 4.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile. The benzyl ether is cleaved in Step 4.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether were not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
