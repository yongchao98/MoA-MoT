    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State (`t < 0`)**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -γ (S · z_hat) B = -γB S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin-up, `|+z⟩`) and `-ħ/2` (spin-down, `|-z⟩`).\n    *   The corresponding energy levels are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (`t > 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to `B_final = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_final = -γ (S · y_hat) B = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)⟩` for `t > 0` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y/ħ) |+z⟩`.\n    *   To calculate this, we need to work in the eigenbasis of `S_y`. The eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, with corresponding eigenvectors `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩`.\n    *   These eigenvectors can be expressed in the z-basis as:\n        *   `|+y⟩ = (1/√2) * (|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩)`\n        *   `|-y⟩ = (1/√2) * (|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩)`\n    *   We can express the initial state `|+z⟩` in terms of the `S_y` eigenvectors:\n        *   `|+z⟩ = (1/√2) * (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)`\n    *   Now, we can apply the time evolution operator. The energies corresponding to the `S_y` eigenstates are `E_{+y} = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2)|+y⟩ + (1/√2)|-y⟩ ]`\n    *   Since `|+y⟩` and `|-y⟩` are energy eigenstates of `H`:\n        *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * [ e^{-iE_{+y}t/ħ}|+y⟩ + e^{-iE_{-y}t/ħ}|-y⟩ ]`\n        *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * [ e^{-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ}|+y⟩ + e^{-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ}|-y⟩ ]`\n        *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * [ e^{iγBt/2}|+y⟩ + e^{-iγBt/2}|-y⟩ ]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value**\n    *   We want to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, we need to calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n    *   To do this, we express `|ψ(t)⟩` back in the z-basis.\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * [ e^{iγBt/2} (1/√2)(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩) + e^{-iγBt/2} (1/√2)(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩) ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) * [ (e^{iγBt/2} + e^{-iγBt/2})|+z⟩ + i(e^{iγBt/2} - e^{-iγBt/2})|-z⟩ ]`\n    *   Using Euler's identities, `cos(x) = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2` and `sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/(2i)`:\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = (1/2) * [ 2cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + i(2isin(γBt/2))|-z⟩ ]`\n    *   `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩`\n    *   Now we can calculate `⟨S_z(t)⟩`:\n    *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z| ] S_z [ cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩ ]`\n    *   Applying `S_z` (where `S_z|+z⟩ = +ħ/2|+z⟩` and `S_z|-z⟩ = -ħ/2|-z⟩`):\n    *   `S_z|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)(+ħ/2)|+z⟩ - sin(γBt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩ ]`\n    *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ cos(γBt/2)⟨+z| - sin(γBt/2)⟨-z| ] * [ cos(γBt/2)|+z⟩ + sin(γBt/2)|-z⟩ ]`\n    *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2) ]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n    *   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        *   `⟨μz(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This is an oscillatory function of time. The general form of an oscillation is `A*cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing the result with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation `ω`.\n    *   `ω = γB`\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the magnetic moment vector `⟨μ⟩` precesses around the new magnetic field direction (`y-axis`) at the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the z-axis oscillates at this same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
