    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle states that for a quantum state, the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt or τ) are related by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δτ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical calculations and order-of-magnitude estimates, this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis ΔE represents the \"energy width\" or the inherent \"blurriness\" of the energy level. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly sharp energy.\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two different energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy width of each level.\n\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE1 and |E1 - E2| > ΔE2\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty (width), and this larger width is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels. Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy separation must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n\nLet's calculate the energy widths for both states.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Lifetime of state 1, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nState 1 has the shorter lifetime, so it will have the larger energy width (ΔE1). This is the one we need to overcome.\n\nΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\nΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n\nSince τ1 < τ2, it follows that ΔE1 > ΔE2. The minimum required energy separation is therefore determined by ΔE1.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s is approximately:\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, let's calculate the larger energy width, ΔE1:\nΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\nΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\nΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, to clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than approximately 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\nB) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is significantly larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This would be clearly resolvable.\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\nTherefore, the only option that represents a large enough energy difference for the two levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
