    "An elegant problem! To solve this, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Positional Observability:** Can the star be seen from both observatories?\n2.  **Brightness Observability:** Is the star bright enough to be detected by both spectrographs?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n### **1. Positional Observability (Declination Check)**\n\nAn object is observable from a specific latitude if its declination (DEC) falls within a certain range. We can determine this range from the latitude of each observatory.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Located at a latitude (φ) of approximately -24.6° (24.6° South).\n    *   A star is observable if its declination is less than the co-latitude north of the observatory, so: `DEC < 90° + φ`.\n    *   `DEC < 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°`.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):**\n    *   Located on Mauna Kea at a latitude (φ) of approximately +19.8° (19.8° North).\n    *   A star is observable if its declination is greater than the co-latitude south of the observatory, so: `DEC > φ - 90°`.\n    *   `DEC > 19.8° - 90° = -70.2°`.\n\nTherefore, for a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the range:\n**-70.2° < DEC < 65.4°**\n\n### **2. Brightness Observability (Magnitude Check)**\n\nThe problem gives us the limiting apparent V magnitude for each instrument.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** `V < 17 mag`\n*   **HIRES:** `V < 16 mag`\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** spectrographs, it must be brighter than the stricter limit:\n**V < 16 mag**\n\nNow we apply these two conditions to each star. We will use a Python script to perform the necessary calculations for apparent magnitude (`V`), which is determined by the formula: `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the interstellar absorption (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_observability(star_name, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES based on its\n    declination and apparent V magnitude.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Condition 1: Positional Observability ---\n    # Paranal (ESPRESSO) is at lat -24.6 deg, so it can see stars with DEC < 65.4 deg.\n    # Keck (HIRES) is at lat +19.8 deg, so it can see stars with DEC > -70.2 deg.\n    espresso_dec_max = 65.4\n    hires_dec_min = -70.2\n    \n    # --- Condition 2: Brightness Observability ---\n    # ESPRESSO: V < 17 mag\n    # HIRES: V < 16 mag\n    # The stricter combined limit is V < 16 mag.\n    mag_limit = 16.0\n\n    # Extract star properties\n    dec = params['DEC']\n    V = params.get('V', None) # Apparent magnitude\n    \n    # Calculate apparent magnitude V if not provided directly\n    if V is None:\n        M_V = params['M_V']     # Absolute magnitude\n        d = params['d']         # Distance in parsecs\n        E_BV = params.get('E_BV', 0) # Color excess (default to 0 if no extinction)\n        A_V = 3.1 * E_BV        # Interstellar absorption in V-band\n        \n        distance_modulus = 5 * math.log10(d) - 5\n        V = M_V + distance_modulus + A_V\n        \n    print(f\"--- {star_name} ---\")\n    \n    # Check declination\n    dec_observable = hires_dec_min < dec < espresso_dec_max\n    print(f\"DEC = {dec:.1f}°.

Yes\n\n```\n---\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **Star1** fails the declination check (it's too far south for Keck).\n*   **Star2** fails the magnitude check (it's too faint for HIRES).\n*   **Star3** passes both checks.\n*   **Star4** fails the magnitude check after accounting for extinction (it's too faint for HIRES).\n*   **Star5** passes both checks.\n\nTherefore, the stars that can be detected with both instruments are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine which stars are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, we need to check two criteria for each star:\n1.  **Positional Observability (Declination)**: The star must be visible from both the Northern Hemisphere (Keck) and the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal).\n2.  **Brightness Observability (Apparent Magnitude)**: The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments.\n\n### **1. Positional Observability Criteria**\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO)** is at latitude ~24.6° South. It can observe objects with a declination (DEC) less than approximately +65.4°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES)** is at latitude ~19.8° North. It can observe objects with a declination greater than approximately -70.2°.\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from **both** locations, its declination must be in the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Brightness Observability Criteria**\n*   **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with an apparent magnitude `V < 17 mag`.\n*   **HIRES** can observe stars with an apparent magnitude `V < 16 mag`.\n*   To be observed by **both**, a star must satisfy the more restrictive condition: **V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Star**\n\nLet's check each star against these two criteria using the output from the code execution:\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the observable range (too far south for Keck).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = 55°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** V = 16.5 mag. This is too faint for HIRES (V must be < 16 mag).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = 48°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** V = 15.5 mag. This is bright enough for both instruments (V < 16 mag).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** The code calculated the apparent magnitude as V = 16.74 mag after accounting for interstellar extinction (`V = Mv + 5*log10(d) - 5 + Av`). This is too faint for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = 60°. This is within the observable range.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** The code calculated the apparent magnitude as V = 14.99 mag (`V = Mv + 5*log10(d) - 5`). This is bright enough for both instruments.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nThe stars that can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
