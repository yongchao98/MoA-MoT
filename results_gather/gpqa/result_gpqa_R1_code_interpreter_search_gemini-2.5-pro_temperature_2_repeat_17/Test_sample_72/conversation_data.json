    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given two astronauts with different masses and relativistic speeds, both moving in the same direction. We need to calculate two quantities:\n*   The relative speed between the two astronauts.\n*   The total energy of the system, which consists of both astronauts.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: `v₁ = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: `v₂ = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince both astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative speed. When two objects are moving in the same direction with velocities `u` and `v` in a given reference frame, their relative speed `v_rel` is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/c²) `\n\nLet's set `u = v₁ = 0.6c` and `v = v₂ = 0.5c`.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Substitute the values into the formula.\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²) `\n\n*   **Step 2:** Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator.\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²) / c²) `\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) `\n\n*   **Step 3:** Perform the final calculation.\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 `\n    `v_rel = (1/7)c `\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c `\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy `E` of a particle with rest mass `m₀` moving at speed `v` is given by the formula:\n\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n\nwhere `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the energy of astronaut 1 (E₁).**\n    *   `m₀₁ = 2m`\n    *   `v₁ = 0.6c`\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ₁`:\n        `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Now, calculate `E₁`:\n        `E₁ = γ₁ * m₀₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the energy of astronaut 2 (E₂).**\n    *   `m₀₂ = 3m`\n    *   `v₂ = 0.5c`\n    *   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   Now, calculate `E₂`:\n        `E₂ = γ₂ * m₀₂ * c² = (1.1547) * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the total energy of the system (E_total).**\n    `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n    `E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²`\n    `E_total = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of these calculations, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Relative Speed Calculation ---\nv1_c = 0.6  # v1/c\nv2_c = 0.5  # v2/c\n# v_rel/c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\nv_rel_c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\n\n# --- Total Energy Calculation ---\n# E_total / (m*c^2) = gamma1 * (m1/m) + gamma2 * (m2/m)\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1_m = 2.0  # m1/m\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\nE1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2_m = 3.0  # m2/m\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\nE2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total_mc2 = E1_mc2 + E2_mc2\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total_mc2:.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n> Relative speed: 0.14c\nTotal energy: 5.96 mc^2\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) `v_rel =0.1c` , `E= 4.96 mc²` (Incorrect)\nB) `v_rel=0.14c`, `E=5mc²` (Incorrect `E`)\nC) `v_rel = 1.1c` , `E= mc²` (Incorrect `v_rel` and `E`)\nD) `v_rel = 0.14c` , `E= 5.96 mc²` (Correct)\n\nThe results from our calculations match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the relative speed between two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds, we use the Einstein velocity-addition formula. Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction, the relative speed `v_rel` between them (with speeds `v₁` and `v₂` in a common reference frame) is given by:\n\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁*v₂) / c²) `\n\nGiven:\n*   `v₁ = 0.6 c`\n*   `v₂ = 0.5 c`\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²) `\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c²/c²) `\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**Part 2: Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * m₀ * c²`, where `m₀` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E₁ + E₂`).\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n*   Rest mass `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Speed `v₁ = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n*   Rest mass `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Speed `v₂ = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c`, and the total energy is approximately `5.96 mc²`. These values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
