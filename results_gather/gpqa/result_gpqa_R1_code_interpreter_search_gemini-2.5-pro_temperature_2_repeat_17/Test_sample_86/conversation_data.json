    "**1. Deconstruction of the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms (C8).\n*   **Core Structure:** It has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Information:**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Putting it together:**\n    *   The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   This leaves 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms for the second substituent.\n    *   This second substituent must also contain the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Identifying Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find a 2-carbon group that contains a carbonyl. The two most common and stable possibilities are:\n*   **An acetyl group:** -COCH3. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure is **haloacetophenone** (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n*   **An acetic acid group attached via its methylene carbon:** -CH2COOH. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure is **(halophenyl)acetic acid** (X-C6H4-CH2COOH).\n\nBoth of these structures fit all the initial criteria:\n*   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n*   8 Carbon atoms: Yes (6 in ring + 2 in substituent).\n*   Carbonyl group: Yes (ketone or carboxylic acid).\n*   Aromatic-halogen bond: Yes.\n\n**3. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Data Options**\n\nThe splitting pattern of the aromatic protons in an NMR spectrum is highly indicative of the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). The options showing two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. This symmetrical pattern gives a clean A₂B₂ (or AA'BB') spectrum, which appears as two distinct doublets. Options A and D show this pattern. Options B and C can be eliminated as they don't show the correct signals for a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Option B:** No signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Shows only one aromatic proton. A di-substituted ring must have four aromatic protons. Incorrect.\n\nNow we must choose between Option A and Option D, which both suggest a para-substituted ring. We will match them to our candidate structures.\n\n**4. Evaluating Option A vs. Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Option A:** ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n*   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** confirm the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** corresponds to a -CH₂- group with no adjacent protons. This matches the -CH₂- group in (4-halophenyl)acetic acid, `X-C₆H₄-CH₂COOH`.\n*   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** would then have to be the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). While carboxylic acid protons are singlets, their chemical shift is typically in the 10-13 ppm range. A value of 9.9 ppm is unusually low. Also, chemical shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are quite downfield for the aromatic protons of a phenylacetic acid derivative (which are typically around 7.2-7.4 ppm). Therefore, this data is not a good match for (4-halophenyl)acetic acid.\n*   Alternatively, 9.9 ppm is a classic chemical shift for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest the structure (4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde (`X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). However, in this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) is adjacent to the methylene protons (-CH₂-), and they would couple with each other. The spectrum should show a triplet for the -CHO proton and a doublet for the -CH₂- protons, not two singlets.\n*   Conclusion: Option A does not accurately represent a plausible structure that fits all the criteria.\n\n**5. Evaluating Option D vs. Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Option D:** ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)\n*   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** again confirm a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a carbonyl group (a methyl ketone).\n*   Let's check if this data matches our candidate structure, **4-haloacetophenone** (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n    *   **Structure:** Has a para-substituted ring, which would give two doublets. Matches.\n    *   **Protons:** It has 4 aromatic protons and 3 methyl protons. The integrations (2H, 2H, 3H) match this.\n    *   **Splitting:** The methyl group is not adjacent to any protons, so it should be a singlet. Matches.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** For ketones, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group deshields the ortho protons (closer to the group), shifting them downfield. The aromatic signals at 7.6 and 7.8 ppm are very reasonable. A methyl ketone singlet typically appears around 2.1-2.6 ppm, so 2.3 ppm is a perfect fit.\n*   Conclusion: The NMR data in Option D is an excellent match for a 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone or 4-iodoacetophenone), which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nFinal comparison confirms that Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
