    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This is very close to 1/7 (which is approximately 0.142857). If the mass fraction is 1/7, then `7y = 12x + y`, which means `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   A formula of CxH2x, or CnH2n, corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is the result of hydrogenating other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) and mixture Y (containing liquids C and D) can both be hydrogenated to yield *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a critical clue. It implies that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) share the exact same carbon skeleton as Z. The differences between them are only the number of hydrogen atoms (i.e., the degree of unsaturation).\n    *   Since Z is a cycloalkane, A, B, C, and D must all be based on the same cyclic carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests they are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know one component of Y is Z itself. Let's say C = Z.\n    *   So, C = CnH2n (a cycloalkane), which is saturated.\n    *   The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to Z. The most logical candidate for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Aromatization of a CnH2n cycloalkane ring typically involves the formation of a benzene ring structure. This process involves the loss of at least 6 hydrogen atoms. The general formula for a mono-alkyl substituted benzene is CnH2n-8 (e.g. Toluene C7H8) while Benzene itself is C6H6. A general formula that links an alkyl-cycloalkane CnH2n to its corresponding aromatic is CnH2n-6 (e.g., hydrogenating C6H6 (Benzene) gives C6H12 (Cyclohexane), and H count difference is 6; hydrogenating C7H8 (Toluene) gives C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane), and H count difference is 6).\n    *   So, we can deduce: Y = {C (CnH2n), D (CnH2n-6)}.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorize bromine water (so they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   X is converted to Y via a disproportionation reaction upon heating with a platinum catalyst.\n    *   The overall reaction converts the equimolar mixture X into the equimolar mixture Y. The simplest and most direct interpretation is a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In a disproportionation reaction involving hydrocarbons, hydrogen atoms are transferred from one molecule to another. One molecule is oxidized (loses H), and another is reduced (gains H).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen atom balance:\n        H(A) + H(B) = H(C) + H(D)\n        H(A) + H(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n    *   The components of X, A and B, must be unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with a C_n skeleton. The most common types are cycloalkenes (formula CnH2n-2) and cycloalkadienes (formula CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let's assume A is a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and B is a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in one pair of molecules from X = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the hydrogen atom count for Y. This confirms our assignments for A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) + CnH2n-4 (diene) → CnH2n (cycloalkane) + CnH2n-6 (aromatic). This is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer, where the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n':**\n    *   The problem can now be solved if we can find 'n'. The information given (\"widely used as a solvent\", etc.) is general enough to apply to several possibilities. Let's test small, common values for `n` (noting that n must be at least 6 to form a benzene ring).\n    *   **Case n=6:**\n        *   Z = C6H12 (Cyclohexane). %H = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. It's a common solvent.\n        *   Y = {C6H12 (Cyclohexane), C6H6 (Benzene)}. An equimolar mixture. Both don't decolorize Br2 water.\n        *   X = {C6H10 (Cyclohexene), C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene)}. Both are unsaturated liquids. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X would be 10 + 8 = 18. This matches option C. This entire scenario is chemically consistent.\n    *   **Case n=7:**\n        *   Z = C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane). %H = 14/98 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. Also used as a solvent.\n        *   Y = {C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane), C7H8 (Toluene)}.\n        *   X = {C7H12 (a Methylcyclohexene), C7H10 (a non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be 12 + 10 = 22. This matches option A. This scenario is also chemically consistent.\n\n6.  **Resolve the Ambiguity:**\n    *   Both the n=6 and n=7 cases are chemically plausible and match options in the multiple-choice list. However, such problems in chemistry contests are typically designed to have a single correct answer.\n    *   The n=6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and archetypal example of these types of disproportionation and hydrogenation reactions involving cyclic compounds. The C7 system is essentially the same chemistry but with an added methyl group. In the absence of information to the contrary, the simplest, parent system is the intended answer.\n    *   Therefore, we choose n=6.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   For n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
