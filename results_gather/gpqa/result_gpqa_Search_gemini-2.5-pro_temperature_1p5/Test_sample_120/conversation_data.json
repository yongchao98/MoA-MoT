    "The reaction in question involves the opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate, specifically lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), which is also known as a Gilman reagent. To determine the correct product, we must follow the established rules for this type of reaction regarding regioselectivity and stereochemistry, which were also helpfully provided in the problem description.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, C2, C6, and O), while C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to H, C1, C5, and O).\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Me₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent). This reagent provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt and general chemical principles state that organocuprates attack the *less sterically hindered* carbon of the epoxide ring. Comparing the two carbons of the epoxide, C1 (tertiary) and C6 (secondary), the C6 position is less hindered. Therefore, the methyl group from the Gilman reagent will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism. This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *inversion of configuration* at the carbon being attacked. The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their original configuration.\n    *   **At C6**: The initial configuration is S. The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an R configuration.\n    *   **At C1**: This stereocenter's configuration is R. The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds directly to the chiral carbon C1 are formed or broken in a way that would invert its stereochemistry. Thus, it retains its R configuration. The oxygen atom becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after an acidic workup step.\n    *   **At C3 and C4**: These stereocenters are remote from the reaction site and their R configurations will not change.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure and Name\n\nFollowing the reaction, we have a new molecule with the following features based on the *original numbering* of the bicyclic system:\n*   An -OH group at C1.\n*   A methyl group at C1 (original).\n*   A methyl group at C3 (original).\n*   A methyl group at C4 (original).\n*   A new methyl group at C6.\n\nTo assign the correct IUPAC name, the resulting cyclohexanol must be re-numbered according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  The carbon bearing the highest priority functional group, the hydroxyl (-OH) group, is assigned as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n2.  The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. We have methyl groups at the new C1 (old C1), old C6, old C3, and old C4.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl substituents at positions 1, 2 (from old C6), 4 (from old C4), and 5 (from old C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so this numbering is correct.\n\nThe product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### Determining the Product's Stereochemistry\n\nNow, we map the stereochemical configurations to the new IUPAC numbering:\n*   **New C1** (Old C1): Retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **New C2** (Old C6): Inverts from S to **R**.\n*   **New C4** (Old C4): Retains its **R** configuration.\n*   **New C5** (Old C3): Retains its **R** configuration.\n\nCombining the name and stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
