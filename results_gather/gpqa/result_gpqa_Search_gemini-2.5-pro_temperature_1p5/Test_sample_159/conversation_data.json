    "### Analysis\nAn N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches the shape of a circle with radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are what we need to determine.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the angle θ for the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern is given by the formula:\nsin(θ) = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture. In this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle, so the diameter D = 2a.\n*   m is a coefficient determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe formula is more precisely written as:\nsin(θ) = (xₙ / π) * λ / D = (xₙ) * λ / (2π * a)\n\nThe intensity minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function, `(π * D / λ) * sin(θ)`, corresponds to the non-zero roots of the function. For the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁ Bessel function.\n\nLet's find the angular positions for the first two minima:\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):** The location of the first minimum is given by the well-known formula for the Airy disk radius, where `sin(θ₁) ≈ 1.22 * λ / D`. Since D = 2a, we have `sin(θ₁) ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a`.\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):** The second minimum corresponds to the next zero of the Bessel function. Its position is given as `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.23 * λ / D`. Substituting D = 2a, we get `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a`.\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁. Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), we have:\n*   θ₁ ≈ 0.61 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ ≈ 1.115 * λ / a\n\nNow, we calculate the difference:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a. A more precise calculation using the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function (x₁ ≈ 3.8317 and x₂ ≈ 7.0156) would yield:\n*   θ₁ = (x₁ / 2π) * λ / a = (3.8317 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ = (x₂ / 2π) * λ / a = (7.0156 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result rounds to 0.507 λ / a. Comparing this with the given options, the closest one is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is calculated to be approximately 0.507 λ / a. Option B is the nearest value.\n\n<<<B>>>"
