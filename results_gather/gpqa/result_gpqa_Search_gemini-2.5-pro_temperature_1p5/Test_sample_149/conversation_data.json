    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is typical of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region is indicative of an amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, which aligns with the aldehyde proton's triplet splitting. This -CH2- group is positioned between the aromatic ring and the aldehyde group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. The chemical shifts of the aromatic protons are consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing an electron-donating group (-NH2) and an electron-withdrawing group (-CH2CHO).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reagent mixture is used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium chloride group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    The addition of water and warming of the diazonium salt solution leads to a hydrolysis reaction (a type of Sandmeyer reaction). The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water. The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**, also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). In the presence of a strong base like KOH, it will undergo a self-condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option B).\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration occurs between the α and β carbons to form a conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) yields a molecule with a double bond between carbon 2 and carbon 3 of the butanal chain.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
