    "Here's a breakdown of the chemical reactions to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe final product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). Lactones are typically formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy acid. The specific hydroxy acid needed to form the product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nThe provided starting materials are all derivatives of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at the other (C5).\n\nTo get the necessary hydroxy acid intermediate, one of these functional groups must be selectively reduced to an alcohol while the other remains a carboxylic acid. The stereocenter at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone product) is not affected by the reduction reactions. Therefore, the stereochemistry (R or S) of the starting material will directly correspond to the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nLet's examine the selectivity of the two reducing agents:\n\n**Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group at the C5 position of starting material A to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n    *   A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n*   The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since LiBH₄ is used to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have been **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a highly selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while typically being much less reactive towards esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** This presents a seeming contradiction, as reducing the carboxylic acid would initially yield a hydroxy-ester (HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu), which cannot directly cyclize into the required lactone. However, the reaction is followed by an acid workup (H⁺). This acidic step can serve a dual purpose: it not only catalyzes the lactonization but can also hydrolyze the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid. The most established and highly selective role of BH₃ is the reduction of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu) + BH₃ → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n*   During the acid workup (H⁺), two things happen: the ester is hydrolyzed, and the resulting hydroxy acid cyclizes.\n    *   HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu + H⁺/H₂O → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH + iBuOH\n    *   This hydroxy acid is *not* the correct one for the target lactone.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the BH₃ reaction. Given the options, there must be a viable pathway. An alternative interpretation is that BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to an alcohol, and the subsequent workup first hydrolyzes the ester at C5 to a carboxylic acid and *then* the lactone is formed. This would result in 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, the same intermediate as in the LiBH₄ reaction.\n\n*   **Revised Reaction B Pathway:**\n    1.  Reduction of COOH with BH₃: (S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu → (S)-HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and lactonization: The hydroxy-ester is worked up with acid, leading to the hydrolysis of the ester and subsequent cyclization. The intermediate would be the same 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nSince this pathway forms the lactone, we look at the stereochemistry. The reaction produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. As the stereocenter is unaffected, the starting material B must have been **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Starting Material A:** Reacts with LiBH₄ to form the (R)-lactone. Since LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester and stereochemistry is retained, A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Starting Material B:** Reacts with BH₃ to form the (S)-lactone. Since BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid and stereochemistry is retained, B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
