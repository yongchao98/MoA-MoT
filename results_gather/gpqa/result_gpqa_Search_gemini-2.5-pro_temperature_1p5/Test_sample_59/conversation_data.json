    "To determine the time experienced by the astronaut, we must first know the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). According to multiple astronomical sources, the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth. This means it takes light 163,000 years to travel this distance.\n\nNext, we calculate the time the journey would take from the perspective of an observer on Earth. Since the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987% the speed of light, the time observed from Earth would be:\n\nTime (Earth) = Distance / Speed = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c ≈ 163,000.21 years\n\nDue to the effects of time dilation, as described by Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for the astronaut will pass much slower than for an observer on Earth. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nTime (astronaut) = Time (Earth) / γ\n\nwhere γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven the spacecraft's velocity (v = 0.99999987 * c), we can calculate the Lorentz factor. Subsequently, we can determine the time elapsed for the astronaut:\n\nTime (astronaut) ≈ 163,000.21 years / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nTime (astronaut) ≈ 163,000.21 years / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nTime (astronaut) ≈ 163,000.21 years / 0.0005099\nTime (astronaut) ≈ 83.13 years\n\nThis means that from the astronaut's perspective, the journey will take approximately 83.13 years. Since the astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey, their age upon arrival at Earth would be:\n\nAge at arrival = 22 years + 83.13 years ≈ 105.13 years\n\nThis is well within the average lifespan of 150 solar years for this alien species. Comparing our calculated travel time to the given options, 81 years is the closest approximation.\n\nA) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth. - Incorrect. The astronaut will be approximately 105 years old.\nB) 72 years - Incorrect.\nC) 77 years - Incorrect.\nD) 81 years - This is the closest value to the calculated 83.13 years.\n\n<<<D>>>"
