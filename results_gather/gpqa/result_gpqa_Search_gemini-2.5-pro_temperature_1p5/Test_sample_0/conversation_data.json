    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly larger than the inherent uncertainty, or \"linewidth,\" of each level. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). The lifetime of a state (τ) corresponds to the uncertainty in time (Δt), and the resulting energy uncertainty (ΔE) is often called the natural linewidth (Γ). This means a state with a shorter lifetime will have a larger uncertainty in its energy.\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state:**\n    *   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n2.  **Determine the condition for resolution:**\n    For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be much larger than the broader of the two linewidths. The broader linewidth belongs to the state with the shorter lifetime, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n3.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only energy difference that is substantially greater than the calculated energy uncertainty is 10⁻⁴ eV, which would allow the two levels to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>"
