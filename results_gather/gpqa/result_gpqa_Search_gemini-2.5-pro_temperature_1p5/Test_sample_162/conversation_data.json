    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### **Part 1: Minimum Volume of Strong Acid**\n\n1.  **Reaction for Dissolution:** Iron(III) hydroxide, a solid base, reacts with a strong acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction to form a soluble iron(III) salt and water.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses of one iron atom, three oxygen atoms, and three hydrogen atoms. It is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ Required:** From the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles H⁺ = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n5.  **Volume of 0.1 M Acid:** The volume of the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed is calculated as follows:\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\n    Based on this calculation, the closest option for the volume is **28.05 cm³**, as stated in option B.\n\n### **Part 2: pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\n1.  **Formation of Hexaaquairon(III) ion:** When iron(III) hydroxide dissolves in the acid, the resulting Fe³⁺ ion becomes hydrated in the aqueous solution, forming the complex ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺.\n\n2.  **Acidity of the Complex Ion:** The [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion acts as a weak acid because the high charge density of the Fe³⁺ ion polarizes the surrounding water molecules, weakening the O-H bonds. This allows a proton (H⁺) to be donated to the solvent water, producing H₃O⁺ and making the solution acidic.\n\n    The equilibrium for this hydrolysis reaction is:\n    [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Concentration of [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺:** The moles of Fe³⁺ formed are equal to the initial moles of Fe(OH)₃. The final volume of the solution is given as 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   Initial [Fe³⁺] = (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n4.  **Calculating the pH:** To find the pH, we use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion. The pKa for this ion is reported to be 2.2.\n    *   Ka = 10⁻ᵖᴷᵃ = 10⁻²·² = 6.31 x 10⁻³\n\n    We can set up an equilibrium expression:\n    *   Ka = [H₃O⁺] * [[Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n\n    Letting x = [H₃O⁺] at equilibrium:\n    *   6.31 x 10⁻³ = x² / (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\n\n    Since the Ka value is relatively large compared to the initial concentration, we solve the full quadratic equation:\n    *   x² + (6.31 x 10⁻³)x - (5.904 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n    *   Solving for x (the [H₃O⁺] concentration) gives: x ≈ 5.17 x 10⁻³ M\n\n5.  **Final pH Calculation:**\n    *   pH = -log₁₀([H₃O⁺]) = -log₁₀(5.17 x 10⁻³) ≈ **2.29**\n\nThis calculated pH of ~2.29 is closest to the pH of **2.04** from option B, with the discrepancy likely arising from slight variations in the pKa value used or potential experimental conditions not accounted for in this theoretical calculation. However, both the calculated volume and pH point most strongly to option B.\n\nConsidering both the calculated acid volume (28.07 cm³) and the resulting pH (~2.29), option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
