    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax (plx), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Uniform Distribution**: The assumption of a uniform distribution of stars means that the number density of stars, let's call it ρ (rho), is constant throughout space. This means there's the same number of stars in any given volume, no matter where that volume is.\n\n2.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: Consider the stars at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from Earth. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: With a constant stellar density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: Parallax (`plx` or `p`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). The standard definition used by astronomers is `d = 1/p`, where `d` is in parsecs and `p` is in arcseconds. From this, we can express `d` in terms of `p`.\n\n5.  **Expressing the Differential**: We now need to relate the thickness of the shell, `dd`, to a change in parallax, `dp`. We can do this by differentiating the distance equation `d = 1/p` with respect to `p`:\n    `dd/dp = -1/p²`\n    Therefore, `dd = -dp/p²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we are counting the number of stars within a certain parallax range, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\n6.  **Substitution**: Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/p)² * (dp/p²) `\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/p⁴) * dp`\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/dp`.\n    `dN/dp = 4πρ / p⁴`\n\n8.  **Proportionality**: Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/dp ∝ 1/p⁴` or `1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit parallax interval decreases as the fourth power of the parallax. A paper on the use of trigonometric parallaxes confirms this relationship, stating that for a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number per unit parallax interval `dn` is proportional to `1/π⁴`, where `π` is the parallax.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
