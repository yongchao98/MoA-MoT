    "To determine the joint probability, we must express the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle$ in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$. This relationship is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe given coupled state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nHere:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 1)\n*   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 2)\n*   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n*   $m = -1$ (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum)\n\nWe want to measure the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The measurement we are interested in is when both electrons yield an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$.\n*   For $L_{1z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   For $L_{2z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$ upon measurement is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n$P(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) = |\\langle l_1=1, m_1=-1; l_2=1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific case:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (as $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nThis means that the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is orthogonal to the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is actually a superposition of states where $m_1+m_2 = -1$, specifically the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle$. It has no component along the $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ direction.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ simultaneously is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n<<<C>>>"
