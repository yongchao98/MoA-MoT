  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein.

You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "By analyzing the provided DNA sequence, the reason for the lack of protein overexpression becomes clear.\n\nThe sequence begins with `ATG`, the universal start codon, which initiates translation. Following the start codon is the sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag (`TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`), which correctly codes for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA.\n\nHowever, immediately following the HA tag sequence and a codon for Lysine (`AAA`), the sequence contains the triplet `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon. The ribosome interprets this codon as a signal to detach from the mRNA, which results in the premature termination of translation. This would produce only a very short, non-functional peptide consisting of the HA tag and a single lysine residue, instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This event is also known as a nonsense mutation.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While possible in some protein constructs, it is not as definitive as the presence of a premature stop codon.\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is flawed. Stop codons are not recognized by tRNAs but by release factors that terminate translation. Furthermore, the problematic codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The mutation in the HA tag sequence (`GCC` instead of the more common `GCT`) is a silent (synonymous) mutation because both codons specify the amino acid Alanine. It does not change the resulting amino acid sequence and is therefore not a missense mutation.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome's early termination of translation due to a premature stop codon is the correct explanation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
