    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f**(r) within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field is defined by its magnitude, f(r) = 1/r², and is directed radially outward. This can be written in vector notation as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the Divergence Theorem, which is also known as Gauss's theorem. The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V to the surface integral of the field's flux through the closed surface S that encloses the volume. Mathematically, it is stated as:\n\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ **n̂**) dS\n\nHere, **n̂** represents the outward pointing unit normal vector to the surface S. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector is simply the radial unit vector, **r̂**.\n\nThe vector field on the surface of the sphere of radius R is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**. The dot product within the surface integral is then:\n\n**f** ⋅ **n̂** = (1/R² **r̂**) ⋅ **r̂** = 1/R²\n\nNow, the surface integral becomes:\n\n∮_S (1/R²) dS = (1/R²) ∮_S dS\n\nThe integral ∮_S dS is the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR². Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of the field **f**(r) = **r̂**/r² gives zero for all points where r ≠ 0. However, the field is singular at the origin (r = 0), and the divergence at this point is undefined in the classical sense. This singularity is the source of the non-zero result. The Divergence Theorem is still applicable because the integral of the divergence over the entire volume correctly accounts for the \"source\" at the origin.\n\nIn fact, the divergence of this specific vector field is more formally described by the Dirac delta function: ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ(r). The volume integral of this expression over a sphere containing the origin is:\n\n∫_V 4πδ(r) dV = 4π\n\nBoth methods confirm that the value of the integral is 4π.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
