    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):**\n    *   This complex splitting means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton has one proton neighbor (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has two equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton has three equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be attached to a carbon that is bonded to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and a **CH₃** group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):**\n    *   This pattern indicates a single proton is split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton has one proton neighbor (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has two equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has another, different set of two equivalent proton neighbors (a second CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be attached to a carbon that is bonded to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and another, non-equivalent **CH₂** group.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nNow, we must find which molecule contains *both* a proton in a `dtq` environment and a *different* proton in a `dtt` environment.\n\nLet's use IUPAC names for clarity:\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C2, the CH₂ on C4, and the methyl group on C3. This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₃`) creates a **dtq** signal.\n*   This molecule lacks a proton adjacent to a `CH` and two separate `CH₂` groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure C (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C4, the CH₂ on C2, and the methyl group on C3. This creates a **dtq** signal.\n*   This molecule also lacks the environment needed to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure D (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C4, the CH₂ on C2, and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3. This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) creates a **dtt** signal.\n*   The proton on C4 is adjacent to the CH on C3, the CH₂ on C5, and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4. This also creates a **dtt** signal.\n*   This molecule lacks a proton adjacent to a `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` group, and thus cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the connectivity: `CH₃(g)CH₂(f)-C(3)H(C(e)H₂CH₃(d))-C(2)H(C(c)H₂CH₃(b))-COOH`\n*   **dtt signal:** The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C2, the CH₂ on C(f) (from the main chain), and the CH₂ on C(e) (from the ethyl substituent). This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) perfectly describes the requirement for a **dtt** signal.\n*   **dtq signal:** Now we must find the proton with `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` neighbors. A careful look at the structure reveals that no single proton has this exact combination of neighboring groups. However, the question states that both signals are observed. In complex chiral molecules, protons that are chemically different (diastereotopic), like the two protons on the CH₂ of an ethyl group next to a chiral center, can have complex splitting. The proton `H(2)` is coupled to `H(3)` (1H) and the `CH₂(c)` (2H), which would produce a doublet of triplets (`dt`). It is the proton `H(3)` that is uniquely positioned to give the highly specific `dtt` pattern. The only way to also obtain a `dtq` is if another proton in the molecule, likely one of the diastereotopic methylene protons on an ethyl group, gives rise to a complex multiplet that is being described as a `dtq`. Given the definitive `dtt` signal arising from H(3), structure B is the only plausible candidate among the choices that can produce this specific pattern.\n\nSince only structure B can generate the clear doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) signal from the proton at the C3 position, it is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
