    "### To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), a step-by-step calculation is performed:\n\nFirst, calculate the initial molar concentrations of the two components in the solution.\n\n*   **For potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄):**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   This salt dissociates to produce the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n    *   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **For disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   This salt dissociates to produce the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n    *   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), forming a buffer. This system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which has a dissociation constant Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nThe equilibrium is:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThis equilibrium is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The concentration of the orthophosphate ion can be found using the expression for Ka₃:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nUsing the previously calculated values (assuming the equilibrium concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] is approximately equal to its initial concentration, a valid assumption since Ka₃ is very small):\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
