    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer ($n=0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\nThe different energy states are:\n*   **Ground state:** For n=0, the energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** For n=1, the energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** For n=2, the energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** For n=3, the energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$, known as its degeneracy, is given by the formula $g_n = \\frac{1}{2}(n+1)(n+2)$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(3+1)(3+2) = \\frac{1}{2}(4)(5) = 10$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<D>>>"
