    "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Time dilation is the phenomenon where time passes slower for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) of the ejecta with respect to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The proper time (Δt₀) in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds. This is the time measured by a clock moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time dilation:** First, we need to find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt). The formula for time dilation is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    where γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this value:\n        (v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96 ≈ 1.02062\n\n4.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s\n    This means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure about 51.031 seconds.\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    *   Now, we can calculate the distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy using the classic distance formula (distance = speed × time):\n        Distance = v * Δt\n        Distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
