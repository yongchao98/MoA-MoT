    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we need to analyze the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$ using dimensional analysis in the context of Quantum Field Theory (QFT), assuming a 4-dimensional spacetime.\n\n### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields and the Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where $\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴ to compensate.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the individual components of the Lagrangian are determined from their kinetic terms:\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing that the derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1, we get $[\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + 1 = 4$. This implies $2[\\psi] = 3$, so the mass dimension of the fermion field $\\psi$ is $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the gauge field (like the electromagnetic field) is $-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$, which means the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n*   **Sigma matrix $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nThe interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$ must have the same mass dimension as the overall Lagrangian density, which is 4.\n\nWe can set up an equation for the mass dimensions of the components of $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The general criteria are as follows:\n*   **Renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero ($[\\text{coupling}]_M \\ge 0$). If the dimension is exactly zero, the theory is often called \"renormalizable,\" and if it is positive, it is \"super-renormalizable.\"\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ($[\\text{coupling}]_M < 0$).\n\nSince the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction Lagrangian is non-renormalizable. Such theories are typically considered effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
