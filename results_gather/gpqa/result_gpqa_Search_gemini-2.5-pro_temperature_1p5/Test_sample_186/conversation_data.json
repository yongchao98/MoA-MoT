    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must first establish the instrument's detection limit under the specified conditions and then assess each star's visibility and brightness.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 is achieved in a one-hour exposure using a single 8m VLT telescope. According to documentation for the ESPRESSO instrument, in this 1-UT mode, an S/N of 10 can be obtained for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of 17.1 in a one-hour (3x 20 minutes) exposure. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17.1 will be detectable.\n\nNext, we must verify if the stars are visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52° 41′, making it easily observable from Paranal in the southern sky.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since -0.74 is much less than 17.1, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89° 15′. It is a circumpolar star for the northern hemisphere and is not visible from the southern latitude of Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** As it is not visible, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** With a declination of 0°, this star lies on the celestial equator and is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10).\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is less than 17.1, so this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is greater than 17.1, making this star too faint and thus **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is less than 17.1, so this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Its declination of 0° makes it observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5\n*   **Conclusion:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is greater than 17.1, so this star is **not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, three of the listed stars are detectable: Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc.\n\n<<<D>>>"
