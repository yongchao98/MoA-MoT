    "To determine which of the listed physical theories never requires regularization at high energies, we must examine the fundamental structure of each. Regularization is a technique used to handle infinities, specifically ultraviolet (UV) divergences, that arise in calculations, typically those involving loops in Feynman diagrams which correspond to very high energies or short distances.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD is a quantum field theory (QFT). Like other QFTs, its calculations for particle interactions involve integrals that diverge at high energies. To make meaningful predictions, QCD requires a process of regularization, such as lattice regularization or dimensional regularization, followed by renormalization.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED, the quantum theory of electromagnetism, was the first successful QFT to encounter the problem of infinities in its calculations. It famously requires regularization and renormalization to resolve these ultraviolet divergences and yield finite, high-precision predictions that match experimental results.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** While not a quantum field theory, classical electrodynamics faces its own high-energy (short-distance) problem. If one treats the electron as a point-like particle, its self-energy—the energy of the electric field created by the charge—becomes infinite. To avoid this divergence, a form of regularization is needed, such as assuming the electron has a finite, non-zero radius.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is its potential to be a theory of everything that is free from ultraviolet divergences. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental entities in superstring theory are one-dimensional, extended objects called strings. This extended nature smooths out interactions at very short distances, which prevents the UV divergences that plague quantum field theories from appearing in the first place. Consequently, superstring theory is widely believed to be UV-finite and does not require regularization for high-energy phenomena.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the one that avoids the need for regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
