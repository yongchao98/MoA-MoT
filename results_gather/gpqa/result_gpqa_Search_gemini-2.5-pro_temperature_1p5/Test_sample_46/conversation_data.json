    "Based on the spectroscopic data provided, the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a step-by-step analysis that leads to this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals a degree of unsaturation of 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Â¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe proton NMR data provides detailed information about the structure:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), resulting in a triplet. This is a classic pattern for an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet represents a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). Its downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of an ester, forming an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is a tell-tale sign of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadening is due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a distinct pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant separation between the signals indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (the -NH2 group) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (the ethyl ester group, -COOCH2CH3). The protons ortho to the amine are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the ester are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Potential Structures**\n\nComparing the deduced structural features with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted isomer and an amide, not a primary amine and an ester. Its IR and NMR spectra would not match.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** While it is a 1,4-disubstituted amine, the ester group is different. It would show a propionyl group in the NMR, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data showing a primary amine. It also lacks a primary amine's NMR signal.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring containing a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group. The predicted spectral data for this compound aligns precisely with the data provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is also commonly known as benzocaine.\n\n<<<D>>>"
