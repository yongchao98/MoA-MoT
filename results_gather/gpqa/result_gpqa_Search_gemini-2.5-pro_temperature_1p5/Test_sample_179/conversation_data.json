    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles. This energy is purely electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of a central charge fixed at a point P, and 12 other identical charges that are constrained to be at a distance of 2 meters from P, meaning they lie on the surface of a sphere.\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the entire system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the \"Thomson problem\". For 12 charges, the configuration that minimizes the electrostatic energy is a regular icosahedron, where the charges are located at the vertices.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  **`U_center_sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_sphere_sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**Calculation of the Energy Components:**\n\nThe potential energy `U` between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `d` is given by Coulomb's law: `U = k * q1 * q2 / d`.\n\nThe constants and values given are:\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`.\n*   Elementary charge, `e = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   Distance (radius of the sphere), `r = 2 m`.\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k = 8.9875517923 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy factor `k * q^2 / r`:\n*   `q = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q^2 = (3.204353268 × 10^-19)^2 C² ≈ 1.02678785 × 10^-37 C²`\n*   `k * q^2 / r = (8.9875517923 × 10^9 * 1.02678785 × 10^-37) / 2 J ≈ 4.61445 × 10^-28 J`\n\n**1. Energy of Center-Sphere Interaction (`U_center_sphere`)**\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance `r = 2 m` from the central charge `q`. The potential energy for these 12 pairs is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / r) = 12 * 4.61445 × 10^-28 J ≈ 5.53734 × 10^-27 J`.\n\n**2. Energy of Sphere-Sphere Interaction (`U_sphere_sphere`)**\nThe 12 charges on the sphere form an icosahedron. The total potential energy is the sum of the energies for all 66 pairs of charges. The distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r` fall into three categories:\n*   30 pairs of adjacent vertices (edge length `a`).\n*   30 pairs of next-nearest vertices.\n*   6 pairs of opposite vertices (separated by the diameter `2r`).\n\nThe calculation of this energy is complex but is a standard result from the Thomson problem. The energy can be expressed as `U_sphere_sphere = E_12 * (k * q^2 / r)`, where `E_12` is a dimensionless constant. For an icosahedral configuration, the value of `E_12` is approximately 49.1653.\n\n`U_sphere_sphere ≈ 49.1653 * (k * q^2 / r) ≈ 49.1653 * 4.61445 × 10^-28 J ≈ 2.26894 × 10^-26 J`.\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total ≈ 5.53734 × 10^-27 J + 2.26894 × 10^-26 J`\n`U_total ≈ 0.553734 × 10^-26 J + 2.26894 × 10^-26 J ≈ 2.82267 × 10^-26 J`.\n\nRounding the result to three decimal places gives `2.823 × 10^-26 J`. This value is extremely close to option C. The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used or rounding conventions.\n\n`U_total = 2.82267 × 10^-26` Joules.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 7.056 x 10^-27 J\nB) 122.330 J\nC) 2.822 x 10^-26 J\nD) 5.645 x 10^-26 J\n\nThe calculated value `2.82267 x 10^-26 J` is closest to `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
