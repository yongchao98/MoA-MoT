    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\nPropionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to protect the aldehyde group. This reaction forms a cyclic thioacetal known as a 1,3-dithiolane. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\nButyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This creates a lithiated carbanion, B, at the C2 position.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\nThe carbanion B acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This step adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The resulting product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\nThis reaction is the deprotection of the thioketal (the protected ketone). Reagents like HgCl₂ are used to hydrolyze the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group. The C2 carbon, which is bonded to two ethyl groups, is converted back to a carbonyl carbon. The product, D, is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\nThis is a Wittig reaction, which converts a ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Ylide Formation:** Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt. A strong base (BuLi) then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus to create the phosphorus ylide: Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n*   **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone, D (3-pentanone), reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is exchanged with the alkylidene group of the ylide.\n\nThe final product, E, is formed by joining the carbonyl carbon from 3-pentanone with the carbanionic carbon from the ylide via a double bond:\n(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n\nThe structure of E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n### **13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in the final product, E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene).\n\n**Structure of E:**\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             /   \\\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nThe molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the double bond and passing through its center. This symmetry makes several carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Alkene carbons (C=C):** The two carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Consequently, the four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are also equivalent and will give rise to one signal.\n3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl (-CH₃) carbons at the ends of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent, resulting in a single signal.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct types of carbon atoms in the molecule, which will produce **3** signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
