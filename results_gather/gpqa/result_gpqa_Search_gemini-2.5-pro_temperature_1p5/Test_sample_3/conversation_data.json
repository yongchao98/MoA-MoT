    "The existence of a magnetic monopole, an isolated north or south magnetic pole, would require a fundamental change to Maxwell's equations. In our universe, one of these equations, Gauss's law for magnetism, is a mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist.\n\nIf they did exist, two of the four Maxwell's equations would be modified to create a fuller symmetry between electricity and magnetism:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) is zero. This is because magnetic field lines always form closed loops; they don't originate from or terminate on a single point. The existence of magnetic monopoles would mean they act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, just as electric charges do for the electric field. Therefore, this law would change from ∇ ⋅ B = 0 to a new form where the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density. This is a change to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** To maintain the symmetry of the equations, the existence of magnetic monopoles would also imply the existence of a \"magnetic current\" (the flow of magnetic charges). Faraday's Law, which describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (a curl in the E field), would be modified to include a term for this magnetic current. A moving magnetic charge would generate a circulating electric field. This is a change to the **circulation of the electric field**.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
