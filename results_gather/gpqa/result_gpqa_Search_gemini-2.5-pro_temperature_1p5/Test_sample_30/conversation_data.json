    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis is a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on the toluene ring is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Typically, the para isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance. Therefore, we assume **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate typically convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), the combination of MnO2 and H2SO4 can be used to oxidize substituted toluenes to the corresponding aldehydes. For the subsequent reaction in Step 3 to be a standard, well-known reaction, the product of this step should be an aldehyde. Some sources indicate that the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene under these conditions can yield the aldehyde. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. In this reaction, the enolate of acetone acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under the basic conditions to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The reaction favors the formation of the more stable (E)-isomer.\n\nThus, **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one**.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we analyze the structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-buten-2-one. The molecule has the following structure: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n\n*   The most stable conformation of this molecule is essentially planar to maximize conjugation.\n*   This planar structure possesses a single plane of symmetry (σ), which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   The molecule does not have any axes of proper rotation (Cₙ for n > 1).\n*   It does not have a center of inversion (i).\n*   It does not have any improper axes of rotation (Sₙ).\n\nA molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
