    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride\n\n1.  **Dicarboxylic Acid:** The problem states that a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene was dehydrated to its corresponding anhydride.\n2.  **Anhydride NMR Data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A single peak at ~7 ppm. This chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). A single peak indicates that all the protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, while a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C). The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry, with all carbonyl carbons being equivalent and all alkene carbons being equivalent.\n3.  **Deduction:** The simplest molecule that fits all this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid, which has a *cis*-alkene. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making its two vinylic protons equivalent and its two carbonyl carbons equivalent, as well as its two alkene carbons equivalent. Searches confirm the NMR data for maleic anhydride show a single proton resonance around 7 ppm and two carbon resonances around 136.5 ppm and 167.7 ppm.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The identified maleic anhydride (the dienophile) is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n3.  **Product Stoichiometry:** The molecular formula of maleic anhydride is C₄H₂O₃. The molecular formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is C₉H₁₄. The cycloaddition product would have a formula of C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given in the problem.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes and dienophiles typically produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is usually the major product due to kinetic control, while the *exo* product is the minor, more thermodynamically stable isomer.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the *endo* and *exo* Products\n\nThe reaction creates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ring system with the anhydride fused to it. The key structural features are:\n*   Two **anhydride protons** on the fused five-membered ring.\n*   Two **vinylic methyl groups** on the double bond of the newly formed six-membered ring.\n*   Two **bridgehead methyl groups**.\n*   Two protons on the **methylene bridge** (the CH₂ group).\n\nThe spatial arrangement of these groups differs between the *endo* and *exo* isomers:\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the bicyclic system, placing its two protons in close proximity to the two *vinylic* methyl groups.\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is positioned away from the bicyclic system, making its protons distant from the *vinylic* methyl groups but closer to the *bridgehead* methyl groups.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the NOESY Spectra\n\n1.  **NOESY Principle:** 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically less than 5 Å), irrespective of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n2.  **Differentiating Isomers:** A cross-peak that is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*) must correspond to a spatial proximity that exists only, or primarily, in the *endo* isomer.\n3.  **Prediction:** Based on the structures, a strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is expected between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** in the *endo* isomer. This interaction would be absent in the *exo* isomer due to the large distance between these groups. Therefore, the cross-peak in question connects these specific proton resonances.\n\n### Step 5: Assign NMR Signals and Choose the Correct Option\n\n1.  **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Anhydride Protons:** These are protons on carbons attached to two carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift is expected to be relatively downfield, around **3.5 ppm**. As they are equivalent, they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinylic Methyl Protons:** Methyl groups attached to a C=C double bond typically resonate around **1.5-2.5 ppm**. Given the options, the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** is the correct assignment for the two equivalent vinylic methyl groups.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** Aliphatic methyl groups resonate further upfield, typically around **~1 ppm**. The 6H singlet at ~1 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:** The cross-peak observed in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons. Based on the assignments above, this corresponds to the resonances at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**.\n\n3.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (unclear assignment). Incorrect.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (unclear assignment) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). Incorrect.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). **This matches our deduction.**\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). These groups are far apart. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
