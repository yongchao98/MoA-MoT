    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze the physical principles governing planetary density, particularly the effect of mass and gravitational compression.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet is functionally identical to Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This serves as our baseline for comparison.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with less mass than Earth will experience weaker gravitational compression. For a body with the same raw materials as Earth, less compression means the materials will not be squeezed as tightly, resulting in a lower overall density. Its density would therefore be less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is a \"Super-Earth.\" For planets with the same rocky and metallic composition, a more massive planet will exert a stronger gravitational force on itself. This increased gravity compresses the material throughout the planet, especially in the core, causing its overall density to increase significantly. This phenomenon, known as gravitational compression, means that a 5-Earth-mass planet with Earth-like composition will be considerably denser than Earth. For example, some models show rocky planets with around 5 Earth masses can have densities much higher than Earth's, sometimes approaching 7.6 to 11 g/cm³ depending on the exact composition and structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will undergo the most significant gravitational compression, leading to the highest density. The Earth-mass planet (a) and the 2-Earth-mass planet (b) have densities around 5.5 g/cm³, while the half-Earth-mass planet (d) will be the least dense. Therefore, the planet with the highest density is the one with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
