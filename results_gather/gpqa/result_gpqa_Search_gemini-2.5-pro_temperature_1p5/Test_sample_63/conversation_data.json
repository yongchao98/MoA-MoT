    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, which means no CO₂ was produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This weight gain is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which did not react in any of the tubes, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is inert under the given conditions, strongly suggesting it is Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Identify the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial salts completely decompose into a mixture of gases. Based on the analysis above, the products are:\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** 0.2 mol\n2.  **An oxidizing gas** that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n3.  **An inert gas (N₂):** which is the final product, Gas C.\n\nLet's deduce the identity of the oxidizing gas. Two common nitrogen-based gases from salt decomposition fit this description:\n*   **Case A: The gas is Nitrous Oxide (N₂O).** The reaction with copper would be: `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O is required.\n    *   This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The final 0.1 mol of inert gas (N₂) would be composed of this newly formed 0.05 mol N₂ and another 0.05 mol of N₂ that was also an initial product of the decomposition.\n    *   So, the gaseous products from the initial decomposition would be: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Case B: The gas is Oxygen (O₂).** The reaction with copper is: `O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO`.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we need 0.025 mol of O₂ gas.\n    *   The remaining 0.1 mol of inert gas would be N₂.\n    *   In this scenario, the products are: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n### 3. Identify the Original Salts (A and B)\n\nThe decomposition products contain nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. This points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoanions, like ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite. Let's test the decomposition reactions of these salts.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nNow, let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two salts matches the products we deduced in **Case A**. Let's assume we started with 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   `x NH₄NO₂(s) → x N₂(g) + 2x H₂O(g)`\n*   `x NH₄NO₃(s) → x N₂O(g) + 2x H₂O(g)`\n\n**Total Products:**\n*   **N₂:** x mol\n*   **N₂O:** x mol\n*   **H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x mol\n\nLet's compare this to our derived products from the experiment (Case A): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.2 mol H₂O.\n\n*   If x = 0.05 mol, the predicted products are:\n    *   N₂: 0.05 mol\n    *   N₂O: 0.05 mol\n    *   H₂O: 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol\nThese values perfectly match the experimental results.\n\n### 4. Verify the Initial Mass\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ equals the given starting mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n\n*   Mass of Salt A = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   Mass of Salt B = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis calculated mass is in excellent agreement with the initial 7.20 g. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
