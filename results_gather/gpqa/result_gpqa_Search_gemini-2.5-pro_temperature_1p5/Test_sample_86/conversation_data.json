    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound, we must first deduce its structure based on the given information.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (6 carbons).\n*   **Di-substituted:** There are two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group:** A C=O group is present.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbons and the carbonyl group. A chemically stable and common group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The base structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the ¹H NMR Options:\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given ¹H NMR data to see which one matches the predicted structure of a haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **Expected features of a haloacetophenone spectrum:**\n    *   A signal for the methyl (CH₃) protons of the acetyl group. This should be a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H), typically in the range of 2.0-2.7 ppm.\n    *   Signals for the aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted ring, there will be 4 aromatic protons. Their splitting pattern will depend on whether the substitution is ortho, meta, or para. A para (1,4) substitution often leads to a symmetrical pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm). Electron-withdrawing groups like a carbonyl and a halogen will shift these protons downfield.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, which is highly characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also features a singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H, which is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n        *   Spectral data for known para-haloacetophenones like 4-chloroacetophenone (δ ~7.9 (d, 2H), ~7.4 (d, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H)) and 4-bromoacetophenone (δ ~7.8 (d, 2H), ~7.6 (d, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H)) are very similar to this option. This is a strong match.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data is inconsistent. It lacks the typical aromatic signals in the 7-8 ppm range and the characteristic 3H singlet for a methyl ketone. The signals at ~4.7 ppm and a 2H singlet are not expected.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum completely lacks signals in the aromatic proton region (6.5-8.0 ppm), which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (p-halophenylacetaldehyde, X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), it would also have 8 carbons and fit the general description. However, this option does not contain the 3H singlet expected from the more common acetyl group (-COCH₃) structure which is a ketone. While p-halophenylacetaldehyde is a possibility, the spectrum for p-bromo-phenylacetaldehyde is reported as δ 9.70 (t, 1H), 7.50 (d, 2H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). The splitting of the aldehyde and methylene protons in this literature data (triplet and doublet, respectively) does not match the singlets described in option D.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOption A provides the most accurate and consistent ¹H NMR data for a di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen, which is best identified as a para-haloacetophenone. The two doublets in the aromatic region and the 3-proton singlet for the methyl ketone are the key identifying features.\n\n<<<A>>>"
