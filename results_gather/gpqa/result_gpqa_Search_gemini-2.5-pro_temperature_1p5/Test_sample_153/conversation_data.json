    "Based on the spectral data provided, the unidentified compound is **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a step-by-step analysis that supports this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂ which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with this peak.\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% to the main peak is the M+2 peak. The 3:1 ratio of the M+ to M+2 peaks is a distinct isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   All four options have the same molecular formula and would produce these peaks.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which effectively rules out options C (phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), leaving A and B as the most likely candidates.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This singlet far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its signal is often broad, but being a singlet is expected as it does not have adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is the key to determining the exact isomer. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring is symmetrically substituted. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are chemically equivalent, as are the two protons next to the chlorine atom. This symmetry results in two signals, each representing two protons. Their proximity to each other causes them to appear as doublets.\n    *   In contrast, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) has four unique aromatic protons and would show a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals in the aromatic region.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data from MS, IR, and ¹H NMR all consistently point to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most definitively, the *para* substitution pattern on the aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
