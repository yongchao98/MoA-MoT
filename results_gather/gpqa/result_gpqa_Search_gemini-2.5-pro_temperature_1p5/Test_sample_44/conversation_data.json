    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how four identical spin-1/2 particles (which are fermions) fill the energy levels of a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of the nth level is:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nSince the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A particle's state in this system is defined by its energy level quantum number (n) and its spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**a) Ground State Energy (E₀)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\nE₀ = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**b) First Excited State Energy (E₁)**\n\nTo create the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available empty level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in levels (n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2).\n*   We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for this configuration is:\nE₁ = [2 × (1²E)] + [1 × (2²E)] + [1 × (3²E)] = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**c) Second Excited State Energy (E₂)**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next possible energy configuration that is higher than the first excited state. We can consider different promotions from the ground state configuration (n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2):\n*   **Option 1:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes (n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3).\n    *   Energy = [1 × (1²E)] + [2 × (2²E)] + [1 × (3²E)] = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Option 2:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes (n=1, n=1, n=3, n=3).\n    *   Energy = [2 × (1²E)] + [2 × (3²E)] = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Option 3:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes (n=1, n=1, n=2, n=4).\n    *   Energy = [2 × (1²E)] + [1 × (2²E)] + [1 × (4²E)] = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these options, the lowest energy above the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n### Summary of Energies:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
