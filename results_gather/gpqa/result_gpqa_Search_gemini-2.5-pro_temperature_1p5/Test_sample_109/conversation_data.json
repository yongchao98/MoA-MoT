    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, a two-step analysis of each star's visibility and brightness is required. This involves checking if the star's position in the sky (declination) is observable from both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere observatories, and whether its apparent brightness falls within the detection limits of both instruments.\n\nFirst, the observability of each star from both observatories is assessed. The Paranal Observatory, home to ESPRESSO, is in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude approx. -24° S), and the W. M. Keck Observatory, where HIRES is located, is in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude approx. +20° N). This means Paranal can observe stars with a declination (DEC) less than approximately +66°, while Keck can observe stars with a declination greater than approximately -70°.\n\nNext, the apparent magnitude (m_V) of each star must be within the limits of both spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent magnitude brighter than 17. The HIRES spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. For stars where the absolute magnitude (M_V) is provided, the apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V - 5 + 5log₁₀(d), where 'd' is the distance in parsecs. If interstellar dust is present, the dimming effect, known as extinction (A_V), must also be accounted for. The final apparent magnitude becomes m_V = M_V - 5 + 5log₁₀(d) + A_V.\n\nHere is a star-by-star analysis:\n\n*   **Star 1 (DEC = -75°):** This star's declination is too far south to be observed from the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, it is not detectable by both instruments.\n*   **Star 2 (DEC = 55°, m_V = 16.5 mag):** This star's declination is visible from both observatories. However, its apparent magnitude of 16.5 is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16, making it undetectable by HIRES.\n*   **Star 3 (DEC = 48°, apparent V mag = 15.5 mag):** The star's position is observable from both Paranal and Keck. Its apparent magnitude of 15.5 is brighter than the limits for both ESPRESSO (<17) and HIRES (<16). Thus, it is detectable by both instruments.\n*   **Star 4 (DEC = -48°, M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4):** This star is visible from both hemispheres. Its apparent magnitude is calculated by first finding the extinction, A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. The apparent magnitude is then m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(10) + 1.24 = 16.74 mag. This is brighter than the ESPRESSO limit (<17) but fainter than the HIRES limit (<16), so it cannot be observed by HIRES.\n*   **Star 5 (DEC = 60°, M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc):** This star is observable from both locations. Its apparent magnitude is calculated as m_V = 16.5 - 5 + 5*log₁₀(5) ≈ 15.0 mag. This brightness is within the limits of both ESPRESSO (<17) and HIRES (<16). Therefore, it is detectable by both instruments.\n\nBased on this analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only ones that can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
