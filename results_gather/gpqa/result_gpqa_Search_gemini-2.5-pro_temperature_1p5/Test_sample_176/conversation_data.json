    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation. The crucial laws are the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a star, which is assumed to be a spherical black body, also depends on its surface area (A = 4πR²). Therefore, the luminosity is given by the formula:\n    *   L = σ * A * T⁴ = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is the star's radius, and T is its surface temperature.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. The law states that λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature (T):\n    *   λ_max = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. This implies that objects with the same peak emission wavelength have the same surface temperature.\n\n**Applying the Concepts to the Stars**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The wavelength of maximum brightness (λ_max) is the same for both stars.\n\nFrom Wien's Displacement Law, since both stars have the same λ_max, their surface temperatures must be equal (T₁ = T₂).\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of their luminosities (L₁ / L₂) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nSince the constants 4, π, and σ are the same for both, they cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe can now substitute the known ratios:\n*   The ratio of the radii is R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The ratio of the temperatures is T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nPlugging these values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information regarding the stars' masses and radial velocities is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity of a black body is determined by its radius and surface temperature.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>"
