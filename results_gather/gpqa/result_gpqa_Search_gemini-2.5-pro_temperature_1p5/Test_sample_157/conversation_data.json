    "A dominant-negative mutation creates a mutant protein product that interferes with the function of the normal protein produced by the wild-type allele. In the context of a dimeric transcription factor, this typically occurs when the mutant subunit can still dimerize with a wild-type subunit but renders the resulting heterodimer non-functional.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the scenario and options:\n*   **Wild-type function:** Two normal protein subunits form a functional dimer, which then acts as a transcription factor.\n*   **Mutation Y (Dominant-Negative):** The mutation is in the dimerization domain. In a heterozygote, both wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y) proteins are produced. Three types of dimers can form: WT-WT (functional), WT-Y (non-functional), and Y-Y (non-functional). Because the Y protein \"poisons\" the WT protein by forming inactive heterodimers, the overall function is lost even with a normal allele present.\n*   **Analysis of Options:**\n    *   A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: While aggregation can be a result of some mutations, it is not the most fundamental description of a dominant-negative effect. The primary mechanism is interference, not necessarily aggregation.\n    *   B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: If the mutant protein could not dimerize at all, it would not interfere with the wild-type proteins. The wild-type proteins would be free to form functional WT-WT dimers, leading to a recessive, not dominant, phenotype. This is incorrect.\n    *   C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: A dominant-negative mutation causes a *loss* of the normal function, not a gain of a new or enhanced one.\n    *   D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele: This is the most plausible molecular outcome. The formation of a non-functional, improperly-formed heterodimer (WT-Y) often targets the complex for degradation by the cell's quality-control machinery. This degradation effectively removes the functional wild-type protein from the available pool, directly causing the \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele,\" which is the hallmark of a dominant-negative effect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is that the faulty heterodimers are targeted for degradation, which leads to the loss of function of the protein produced by the wild-type allele.\n\n<<<D>>>"
