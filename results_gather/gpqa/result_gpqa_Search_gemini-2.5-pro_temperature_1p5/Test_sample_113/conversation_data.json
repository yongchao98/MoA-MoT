    "### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent A serves as the proton source. A common method is to use an acid like H₃O⁺ (hydronium, representing an acidic aqueous solution) to protonate the alkoxide. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water. Among the given options, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and an effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The reaction with a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be significantly slower and less efficient. Thus, **B = HCl**.\n\nCombining the reagents for both reactions, we find that A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
