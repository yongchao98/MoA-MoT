    "The final answer is C. Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy balance between the radiation it receives from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_eff is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_eff * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star (so T_eff and R_star are the same) and possess the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe problem provides the periodic Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude, K) by the formula:\n\nΔλ / λ₀ = K / c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (6300 Å). The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following approximation (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, and the orbit is viewed edge-on, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet):\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can express the relationship for each planet:\n\nK₁ ≈ M_p1 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₁))\nK₂ ≈ M_p2 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₂))\n\nNow, let's find the ratio K₁ / K₂ from these expressions:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = [M_p1 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₁))] / [M_p2 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₂))]\nK₁ / K₂ = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nWe want to find sqrt(a₂ / a₁), which is our temperature ratio. We can rearrange the equation:\n\nsqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (K₁ / K₂) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 3/4\n*   The ratio of the planetary masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (3/4) * (5/7)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
