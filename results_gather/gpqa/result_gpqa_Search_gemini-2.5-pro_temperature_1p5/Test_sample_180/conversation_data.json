    "### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Fluxes\n\nTo determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n1.  **Neutrino Sources by Energy:**\n    *   **pp-I Branch:** The primary `p-p` reaction produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to about 420 keV (0.42 MeV). These do not contribute to the energy bands in question (700-900 keV).\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** This branch produces mono-energetic neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). These neutrinos have two distinct energies: a dominant line at **862 keV (0.862 MeV)** and a much weaker line at 384 keV (0.384 MeV). The 862 keV line is the key contributor to the 800-900 keV energy band.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** This branch, which is assumed to have stopped, produces high-energy neutrinos from the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`). These `⁸B` neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. Under normal conditions, they contribute to both the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle produces neutrinos from the decays of Nitrogen-13 (`¹³N`) and Oxygen-15 (`¹⁵O`). Their energy spectra are continuous, extending up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. Therefore, they contribute to both energy bands. However, the CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's energy production, making its neutrino flux significantly lower than that from the main pp-chain branches.\n\n2.  **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch:**\n    *   The problem states that the pp-III branch has stopped. This means the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos, which normally contributes across a wide range of high energies, becomes zero.\n    *   All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Flux Ratio:**\n\n    With the `⁸B` neutrino source turned off, we assess the remaining contributors to each energy band:\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   The dominant `⁷Be` line is at 862 keV, which is outside this band.\n        *   The `p-p` neutrinos are below this band's energy range.\n        *   Therefore, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is from the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`). This flux is known to be very low.\n\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   This band is dominated by the very strong, mono-energetic **862 keV line from `⁷Be`** (part of the pp-II branch).\n        *   There is also a small contribution from the CNO cycle neutrinos in this range.\n\n    *   **The Ratio - Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2):**\n        The flux in Band 1 is composed solely of the low-intensity CNO neutrinos. The flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the high-intensity `⁷Be` neutrino line. The total flux of `⁷Be` neutrinos is roughly two orders of magnitude (a factor of ~100) greater than the total flux of neutrinos from the CNO cycle.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the flux in the 700-800 keV band to the flux in the 800-900 keV band will be approximately the ratio of the CNO flux to the `⁷Be` flux. This results in a very small number, on the order of 1/100 or 0.01.\n\nOf the given choices, 0.01 (10⁻²) is the most accurate approximation for this ratio.\n\n<<<D>>>"
