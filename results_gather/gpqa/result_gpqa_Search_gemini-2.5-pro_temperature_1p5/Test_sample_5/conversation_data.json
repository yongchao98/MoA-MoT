    "### Analysis of the Potential and Derivation of the Energy Spectrum\n\nTo find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to understand the potential it is moving in. The given potential is a function of polar coordinates (r, θ):\n\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential `V(r, θ)`, we get:\n\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nBy combining the terms with `x^2`, we simplify the potential to:\n\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. It is anisotropic because the spring constants, and therefore the oscillation frequencies, are different in the x and y directions. The problem is now separable into two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe potential for the oscillator in the x-direction is `V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2`, and for the y-direction, it is `V_y(y) = 1/2 (k)y^2`.\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) of a harmonic oscillator is given by `ω = sqrt(k_eff/m)`, where `k_eff` is the effective spring constant and `m` is the mass of the particle.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n`ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nFor the y-direction:\n`ω_y = sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω`, where `n` is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nSince the two oscillators are independent, the total energy `E` of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual oscillators:\n\n`E = E_x + E_y`\n`E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y`\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `ω_x` and `ω_y`:\n\n`E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ(sqrt(k/m))`\n\nFactoring out the common term `ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`, we get:\n\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
