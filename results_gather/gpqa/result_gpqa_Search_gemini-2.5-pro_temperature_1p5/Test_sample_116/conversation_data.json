    "Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, causes the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting structure lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral, leading to optical isomerism. The molecule can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The carbon atom at the 2-position is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. This molecule is symmetrical; it possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the carbonyl group. Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism. While benzophenone itself is achiral, it can be a part of a larger chiral molecule or form chiral crystals.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
