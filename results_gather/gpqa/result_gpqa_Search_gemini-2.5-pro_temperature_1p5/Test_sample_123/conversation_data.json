    "The search results confirm the fundamental physics principles used in the initial analysis.\n\n*   **Time Dilation and Particle Decay:** The search confirms that the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is dilated in the observer's reference frame by the Lorentz factor, γ. The survival probability, P(t), which is the fraction of particles remaining after a time t, is given by an exponential decay law. For a moving particle, this is expressed as P(t) = exp(-t / (γτ)), where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Decay Length:** The average distance a relativistic particle travels before decaying, known as the decay length, is given by L = vγτ. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity v is approximately the speed of light, c.\n\nCombining these concepts, the fraction of particles (N/N₀) that travel a distance L before decaying is given by:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-L / (γcτ))\n\nHere, L is the detector radius (30 m), and cτ is the mean proper decay length of the particle. The term cτ is a constant for this type of particle.\n\nWe can establish a relationship between the two scenarios provided in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂) = ?\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n**Solving for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1.  cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)\n2.  γ₂ = 30 / (cτ * ln(1.5))\n\nSubstitute the expression for cτ from the first equation into the second:\nγ₂ = 30 / ([1.5 / ln(3)] * ln(1.5))\nγ₂ = (30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
