    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first deduce the structure of the product from the given reaction.\n\n**1. The Reactant and its Structure:**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** An aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce several functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nTherefore, all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting material will be reduced.\n\n**3. The Product:**\nThe reaction will transform the reactant as follows:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton remains, but all double bonds are gone, and oxygen-containing functional groups are fully reduced to hydrocarbon parts. The product will be a saturated cycloalkane with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n**4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x using the formula:\n\nIHD = c - (h/2) - (x/2) + (n/2) + 1.\n\nFor our product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   c (number of carbons) = 10\n*   h (number of hydrogens) = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined by counting the number of rings and π-bonds in the structure. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
