    "To provide an accurate comparison between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy, we will calculate the order of magnitude for each quantity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe transition energy of a photon can be calculated using its wavelength. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\nhttps://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\Delta&space;E&space;=&space;\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n\nwhere:\n*   **h** is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n*   **c** is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s.\n*   **λ** is the given wavelength, 0.4861 μm or 0.4861 x 10⁻⁶ m.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nhttps://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\Delta&space;E&space;=&space;\\frac{(6.626\\times&space;10^{-34}&space;\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s})(3.00\\times&space;10^{8}&space;\\text{m/s})}{0.4861\\times&space;10^{-6}&space;\\text{m}}&space;\\approx&space;4.089\\times&space;10^{-19}&space;\\text{J}\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the hydrogen-beta line in the Balmer series, which is the transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term represents the energy of a magnetic moment in an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect). The energy is given by:\n\nhttps://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\left\\langle&space;H&space;\\right\\rangle&space;=&space;\\mu_{B}m_{l}B\n\nwhere:\n*   **μ<sub>B</sub>** is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant with a value of approximately 9.274 x 10⁻²⁴ J/T.\n*   **m<sub>l</sub>** is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies \"small values of m,\" so we will use m<sub>l</sub> = 1 for this calculation.\n*   **B** is the magnetic field strength, given as 1 Tesla (T).\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\nhttps://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\left\\langle&space;H&space;\\right\\rangle&space;=&space;(9.274\\times&space;10^{-24}&space;\\text{J/T})(1)(1&space;\\text{T})&space;=&space;9.274\\times&space;10^{-24}&space;\\text{J}\n\n### 3. Comparison of Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the order of magnitude of the two calculated energies:\n\n*   **Transition Energy (ΔE):** ≈ 4.089 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (⟨H⟩):** ≈ 9.274 x 10⁻²⁴ J\n\nBy comparing the powers of ten, it is evident that the paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the transition energy. The transition energy is approximately five orders of magnitude larger than the energy from the paramagnetic coupling in a 1T field.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n\nhttps://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\left\\langle&space;H\\right\\rangle&space;\\ll\\Delta&space;E\n\nThis demonstrates that the energy splitting of orbitals due to a 1T magnetic field is much smaller than the energy difference between the principal energy levels of the hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<B>>>"
