    "A molecule with C3h symmetry must possess a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド) perpendicular to that axis. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n*   **Triisopropyl borate (B(O-i-Pr)3):** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. While it can adopt a propeller-like shape suggesting a C3 axis, the free rotation of the isopropyl groups prevents it from having a rigid, stationary horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not belong to the C3h point group.\n*   **Quinuclidine (C7H13N):** This is a bicyclic amine. It has a C3 rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing carbon-hydrogen (CH) group. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it has three vertical mirror planes that contain the C3 axis, placing it in the C3v point group.\n*   **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** Also known as mellitic trianhydride, this is a planar molecule. It is constructed around a central benzene ring, giving it a threefold rotational symmetry (C3 axis) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Because the molecule is planar, the molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (ﾏド). The presence of both a C3 axis and a ﾏド plane confirms that this molecule belongs to the C3h point group.\n*   **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This large, fused ring system is non-planar due to steric hindrance. This helical twist removes any mirror planes, placing it in the D3 point group, which lacks the required ﾏド plane for C3h symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the only molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
