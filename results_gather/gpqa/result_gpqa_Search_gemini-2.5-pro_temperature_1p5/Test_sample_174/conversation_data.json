    "An oscillating charge distribution, such as a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength. The power radiated by such a dipole is not uniform in all directions.\n\n**Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n`dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation\n*   `c` is the speed of light\n*   `μ₀` is the permeability of free space\n*   `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this problem).\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated at `θ = 90°`, where `sin²(90°) = 1`. Therefore, `A` is proportional to `K * 1`, where `K` represents all the constant terms in the equation.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°`, we evaluate `sin²(30°)`.\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nThus, the power radiated at 30° is `A * (1/4)`. The fraction of the maximum power radiated at this angle is 1/4.\n\n**Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\nThe formula for the radiated power shows a dependence on the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`. The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n\nTherefore, the power radiated is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`. This relationship is fundamental to phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue—shorter blue-light wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer red-light wavelengths.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and the functional form `f` for the power's dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
