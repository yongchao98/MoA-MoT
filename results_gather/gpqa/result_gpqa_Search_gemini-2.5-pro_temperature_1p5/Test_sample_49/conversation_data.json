    "The calculation performed to evaluate Feynman diagrams often involves integrating over unconstrained loop momenta. A key insight from dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime (D=4) is that each loop in a diagram contributes a characteristic factor to the final expression.\n\nWhen calculating the amplitude of a Feynman diagram, each loop requires an integration over the momentum running through it (`∫d⁴k/(2π)⁴`). In dimensional regularization, after performing a Wick rotation to Euclidean space and integrating over the angular components, each loop consistently introduces a factor of `1/(4π)²` (which is `1/(16π²)`). This factor is a standard feature of perturbative quantum field theory calculations.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe crucial term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`. Let's denote the number of loops in the diagram as 'L'. The total loop factor in the expression will be `(1/(4pi)²)^L`.\n\nBy comparing this with the term in the note, we can set up the following equation:\n`(1/(4pi)²)^L = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy equating the exponents, we get:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for L yields:\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other components of the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`) and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), provide information about the number of vertices and the specifics of the interactions, but the power of `1/(4pi)` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops. The diagram, therefore, contained three loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
