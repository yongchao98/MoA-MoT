    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus ($^6$Li).**\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium (Li) with 3 protons and, as specified, 3 neutrons. This gives it a mass number of 6 ($^6$Li). According to the search results, the atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122 u. This value includes the mass of its 3 electrons. To find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons (0.00054858 u each).\n\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u\n*   Nuclear mass of $^6$Li = 6.015122 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01347626 u\n\n**2. Convert the rest mass to energy in GeV.**\nThe conversion factor between the atomic mass unit (u) and energy in Mega-electron-volts (MeV) is approximately 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².\n\n*   Rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$) = 6.01347626 u * 931.5 MeV/u\n*   Rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$) ≈ 5601.55 MeV\n*   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, the rest mass energy is approximately 5.60155 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) for the given speed.**\nThe speed (v) is 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\n*   $v/c = 0.96$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 0.9216$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n*   $\\gamma = 3.571428...$\n\n**4. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest mass energy ($E = \\gamma \\cdot m_0c^2$).\n\n*   E = 3.571428 * 5.60155 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0055 GeV\n\nRounding to three decimal places gives 20.006 GeV. This value is very close to option C.\n\nLet's refine the calculation with a more precise conversion factor: 1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c².\n\n*   Rest mass energy = 6.01347626 u * 931.4941 MeV/u ≈ 5601.446 MeV or 5.601446 GeV.\n*   Total Energy = 3.571428 * 5.601446 GeV ≈ 20.00516 GeV.\n\nThis result (20.005 GeV) is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy might arise from the exact values used for constants (mass of the electron, conversion factor) in the reference calculation for the multiple-choice options. However, among the given choices, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
