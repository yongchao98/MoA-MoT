    "The observed peak at 790 nm followed by a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift quasar. The light at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Lyα line is absorbed by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, creating what is known as the Lyα forest. The rest wavelength of the Lyα transition is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å).\n\nFirst, we calculate the redshift (z) of the quasar using the observed wavelength (λ_obs) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) of the Lyα line:\n\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.50 - 1\nz ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift determined, the next step is to calculate the comoving distance to the quasar. This calculation depends on the cosmological parameters of the universe. The problem provides the necessary parameters for the Lambda-CDM model:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n*   A flat universe (implying the curvature parameter Ω_k = 0)\n\nThe comoving distance (D_c) in a flat universe is calculated using the following integral:\n\nD_c = (c / H₀) * ∫[0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nwhere 'c' is the speed of light.\n\nUsing an online cosmological calculator with the values z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving distance is found to be approximately 8984.4 Mpc, which is about 9.0 Gpc.\n\nThis result is consistent with specialized cosmological calculation tools. Therefore, the most reasonable assumption for the comoving distance of the quasar is 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<A>>>"
