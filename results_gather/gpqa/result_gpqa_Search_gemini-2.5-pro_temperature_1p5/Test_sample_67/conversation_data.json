    "This problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment (and thus its spin) is in an eigenstate along the +z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +y direction, the spin vector begins to precess around the new field direction.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` in a magnetic field `B` is governed by the equation:\n`d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`\nwhere `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThis equation indicates that the spin vector `⟨S⟩` precesses around the magnetic field vector `B` at an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial spin expectation vector points along the +z axis.\n*   The new magnetic field `B` points along the +y axis.\n*   Therefore, the spin vector will precess around the y-axis. As it rotates in the x-z plane, its projection onto the z-axis (the z-component) will oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of this precession, and consequently the oscillation frequency of its z-component, is the Larmor frequency. The formula for the Larmor frequency `ω` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\nHere, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. The search results confirm that this precessional motion and its corresponding frequency are fundamental concepts in magnetic resonance and spin dynamics.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `⟨Sz⟩`, will oscillate as `cos(γBt)`. Thus, the angular frequency of this oscillation is `γB`.\n\nTherefore, the correct oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
