    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the energy difference between the molecule's ground state and the next accessible state with the lowest possible energy, according to the rules of quantum mechanics. The momentum of the photon will then be derived from this energy difference.\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Model:** The diatomic molecule is described by the non-rigid rotor model, where the total energy is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1)\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Initial State (Fundamental State):** This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to v = 0 and J = 0.\n    E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0*(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State (Next Lowest Energy State):** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule, specific selection rules must be followed:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n    Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition is to a state where v=1 and J=1.\n    *   Δv = 1 - 0 = +1 (satisfies the rule)\n    *   ΔJ = 1 - 0 = +1 (satisfies the rule)\n    Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n    E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial state energies.\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n### 3. Calculate the Necessary Physical Constants\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (M_x * M_y) / (M_x + M_y)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kilograms: 1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μR²\n    R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    B = (1.1121 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (2.4152 x 10⁻⁴⁶ J·s²) ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Energy Change (ΔE)\n\nNow we can calculate the two components of the energy change:\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   **Rotational Energy:** ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    ΔE = (4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.2189 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) by the equation E = pc. Therefore, p = E/c.\n\np = (4.2189 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s)\n\nThis value is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
