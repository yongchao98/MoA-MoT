    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes\nFirst, we examine the effect of knocking out each gene individually compared to the wild-type (control) resistance level of 100%.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knock-out):** 75% resistance. This is a partial loss of resistance (25% reduction). G1 contributes to resistance but is not essential on its own.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knock-out):** 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of resistance. This indicates that gene G2 is essential for the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knock-out):** 50% resistance. This is a significant loss of resistance (50% reduction). G3 also contributes to resistance, more so than G1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes (Epistasis Analysis)\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by another's. We compare the double-mutant phenotype to the single-mutant phenotypes.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both the g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants show 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant. When a double mutant exhibits the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, the gene from the single mutant is said to be **epistatic** to the other. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**. This typically implies that G1 and G3 act upstream of G2 in a linear pathway, or that G2's function is absolutely required for any contribution from G1 or G3 to be realized.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** This double mutant has 10% resistance.\n    *   This is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%) or the g3 phenotype (50%). Therefore, there is no simple epistatic relationship where one gene masks the other.\n    *   Instead, the combination of the mutations has a much stronger effect than a simple addition of their individual effects. The loss of resistance in the g1g3 double mutant is 90%, which is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% from g1 + 50% from g3 = 75%). This phenomenon is known as **synergy** or a synergistic interaction. Synergy often indicates that the two genes (G1 and G3) function in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping, or **redundant**, functions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the \"Upstream Transcription Factor\" Constraint\nThe problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others. Let's test this for each gene.\n\n*   **Could G1 or G3 be the upstream TF?** If G1 or G3 were the primary upstream TF for this pathway, its mutant phenotype would be the most severe. This is not the case (g1 is 75% resistant, g3 is 50%, while g2 is 0%).\n*   **Could G2 be the upstream TF?** If G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, a G2 knockout should result in a phenotype at least as severe as the G1 and G3 double knockout. The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, which is indeed more severe than the g1g3 mutant's 10% resistance. This is consistent with G2 being an upstream TF that activates G1, G3, and at least one other gene responsible for the last 10% of resistance.\n\n### 4. Re-evaluate the Options\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  **G2 is a transcription factor** acting upstream.\n2.  **G1 and G3 show partial gene redundancy**, leading to a synergistic phenotype in the double mutant.\n3.  **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**.\n4.  There is **no simple masking epistasis between G1 and G3**.\n\nNow let's check the given choices:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": Cannot be determined from this data.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Incorrect. The g1 phenotype is the mildest.\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": Correct.\n    *   \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Cannot be determined.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Correct. This is a reasonable interpretation of their synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Cannot be determined from the data provided.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption C contains two correct conclusions that can be strongly inferred from the experimental data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). The third statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, but this is also the case for options A and D. Since option C provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of the genetic interactions among the choices, it is the best answer, assuming there is an error in the final clause of the options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
