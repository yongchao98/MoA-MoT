    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if its molecules are chiral. Chirality is the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule is planar and therefore possesses a plane of symmetry, making it **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The specific stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS) indicate a single, specific enantiomer of a complex, bridged molecule. A specific enantiomer is by definition chiral. This compound is **chiral** and therefore optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule, with the chemical formula `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`, has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two centers. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being 2S, 3S) and is **chiral** and optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name explicitly denotes a specific enantiomer, (R). Carbon 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, the alkenyl part of the ring, and the alkyl part of the ring). As a single enantiomer, it is **chiral** and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This nomenclature denotes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through a C-OH group) and is therefore **achiral**.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. An examination of the structure reveals no chiral centers. Carbon 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry and is **achiral**.\n\nCounting the compounds that are chiral and thus optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
