    "To determine the probability that a measurement of the observable *P* will yield the value 0, we must follow the postulates of quantum mechanics. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n### 1. Define the State and Observable\n\nThe state of the system, denoted as the column vector |ψ⟩, is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nThe observable of the system, represented by the matrix *P*, is:\n*P* = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Observable *P*\n\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\nThe determinant is:\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]])`\n`= -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ`\n`= λ(1 - λ²) = λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ)`\n\nSetting the determinant to zero, `λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome of 0, which is one of the eigenvalues. Now, we must find the eigenvector |v₀⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0. We solve the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis yields the system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0  => z = -x`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector by setting x=1:\n|v₀⟩ = `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability *Prob(λ)* of measuring a specific eigenvalue is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩` is the inner product (dot product) of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨v₀|v₀⟩` is the squared norm of the eigenvector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector.\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\n*   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [[-1], [2], [1]] = (1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the Eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the State Vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the probability formula:\n`Prob(0) = |-2|² / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nThus, the probability that the measurement of the observable *P* will yield the value 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
