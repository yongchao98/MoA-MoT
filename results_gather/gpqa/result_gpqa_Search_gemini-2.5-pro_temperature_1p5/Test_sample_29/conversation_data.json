    "The process by which a substance, such as a textile dye, absorbs light and then emits it at a different color is known as fluorescence. A fundamental principle of fluorescence is that the emitted light always has a lower energy and longer wavelength than the absorbed light. This energy difference is called the Stokes shift.\n\nFirst, we determine the color of the light emitted by the organic compound. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. We can convert this energy to a wavelength using the formula λ = hc/E, where a convenient approximation is λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV).\n\n*   Wavelength of emitted light (λ) ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm.\n\nLight with a wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to the green portion of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\nAccording to the principles of fluorescence, the absorbed light must have a higher energy (and thus a shorter wavelength) than the green light it emits. Let's examine the energy levels of the colors listed in the options:\n\n*   **Red:** ~1.65–2.00 eV (lower energy than emitted light)\n*   **Yellow:** ~2.10–2.17 eV (lower energy than emitted light)\n*   **Blue:** ~2.50–2.75 eV (higher energy than emitted light)\n*   **Violet:** ~2.75–3.26 eV (higher energy than emitted light)\n\nBoth blue and violet light have higher energy than the emitted green light (2.3393 eV), making them possible candidates for the absorbed color. However, the absorption and emission spectra for a single fluorescent molecule are often found in adjacent color bands. A common example is the absorption of blue light leading to the emission of green light. Given that blue is the next highest energy color band to green, it is the most probable color of light absorbed by the compound to produce green fluorescence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
