    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions follows specific quantum mechanical selection rules. This process is a cascade decay, where the atom first transitions to an intermediate state and then to the final state.\n\n**Step 1: First Dipole Transition**\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>, which corresponds to the 3s orbital. According to the electric dipole transition selection rules, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\n*   From *l*=0, the only possibility is a transition to *l*=1 (a *p* orbital).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so a transition to *n*=2 is required for a two-step decay to *n*=1. A direct decay to *n=1* would require a change in *l*, resulting in a |1,1,m> state, but this is not the final state |1,0,0>.\n*   For the transition from |3,0,0> to a state with *l*=1, the magnetic quantum number *m* can become -1, 0, or 1.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. Since the initial |3,0,0> state is spherically symmetric and the decay process is isotropic (assuming no external fields), the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of these three *m* sub-levels. Therefore, the probability of transitioning into any specific intermediate state, such as |2,1,0>, is 1/3.\n\n**Step 2: Second Dipole Transition**\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m> to the final state |1,0,0> (the 1s orbital). Let's check the selection rules for each possible intermediate state:\n\n*   **From |2,1,0> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = 0 → 0 = 0 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n*   **From |2,1,1> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n*   **From |2,1,-1> to |1,0,0>**: Δ*l* = 1 → 0 = -1 (allowed), and Δ*m* = -1 → 0 = +1 (allowed). This is a valid transition.\n\nFrom any of the |2,1,m> states, the only energetically favorable state that can be reached via a single dipole transition is the |1,0,0> state. Therefore, the probability of this second step occurring from any of the allowed intermediate states is 1 (or 100%).\n\n**Overall Probability**\n\nThe total probability for a specific decay path is the product of the probabilities of each individual step. For the path |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>:\n\n*   Probability = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)\n*   Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the transition route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> has a total probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{3}}$\n\n<<<B>>>"
