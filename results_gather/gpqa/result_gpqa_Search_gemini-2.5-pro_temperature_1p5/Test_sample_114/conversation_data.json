    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the angle between the two photons based on the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum\n\nThe total energy and momentum of the system before the collision must be conserved. Let the rest mass of both the electron and the positron be *m*.\n\n*   **Energy:** The energy of a particle is given by *E = γmc²*, where *γ* is the Lorentz factor and *c* is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (γe = 4): Ee = 4*mc*²\n    *   Energy of the positron (γp = 2): Ep = 2*mc*²\n    *   **Total Initial Energy:** E_initial = Ee + Ep = 4*mc*² + 2*mc*² = 6*mc*²\n\n*   **Momentum:** The momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the formula *p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c*.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: pe = √((4mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = √(16(mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = √(15)mc. Since it moves from the left, its momentum is positive.\n    *   Momentum of the positron: pp = √((2mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = √(4(mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = √(3)mc. Since it moves from the right, its momentum is negative.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum:** P_initial = pe - pp = (√15 - √3)mc. This momentum is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n\n### 2. Final State: Energy and Momentum of Photons\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. According to the problem, they have equal energies.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons.\n    *   E_initial = E_photon1 + E_photon2\n    *   Since the photon energies are equal (E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E_γ), we have: 6*mc*² = 2 * E_γ\n    *   This gives the energy of each photon: **E_γ = 3*mc*²**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The total momentum of the system must also be conserved.\n    *   The initial momentum is entirely in the horizontal (x) direction. This means the final vertical (y) momentum must be zero. Since the photons have equal energy (and therefore equal momentum magnitude, p = E/c), they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis to cancel out their vertical momentum. Let's call this angle θ.\n    *   The momentum of each photon is p_γ = E_γ/c = (3*mc*²)/c = 3mc.\n    *   The horizontal component of each photon's momentum is p_γ * cos(θ).\n    *   **Total Final Momentum:** The total final horizontal momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photons: P_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum:\n\n*   P_initial = P_final\n*   (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\nWe can cancel *mc* from both sides:\n\n*   √15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nNow, we can calculate the value:\n\n*   √15 ≈ 3.873\n*   √3 ≈ 1.732\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n\n*   Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
