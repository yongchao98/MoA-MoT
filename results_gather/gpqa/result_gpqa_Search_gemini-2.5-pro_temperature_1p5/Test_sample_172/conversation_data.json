    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Position and Momentum:**\n    The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can simultaneously know the position and momentum of a particle. The mathematical relationship is:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δx * Δp = ħ / 2\n\n2.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    We are given the uncertainty in the electron's location, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for Δp:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    The relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) is given by the energy-momentum relation. Since the electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), the relativistic formula for energy E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)² should be considered.\n\n    However, a more direct approach is to relate the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum using the general formula:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp\n\n    The derivative dE/dp represents how energy changes with respect to momentum, which is the particle's velocity, `v`. This relationship, dE/dp = v, holds true for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n\n    Therefore, we can write:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n    Now, substitute the values of `v` and the calculated Δp into the equation:\n    *   v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n    ΔE ≈ (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n    *   A) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n    *   B) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    *   C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    *   D) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\n    The result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
