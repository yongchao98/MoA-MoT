    "While magnons, pions, and phonons are all directly identified as Goldstone bosons (or pseudo-Goldstone bosons) that arise from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, a skyrmion is a distinct entity.\n\n*   **Magnon:** A magnon is the Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet.\n*   **Pion:** A pion is the pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.\n*   **Phonon:** A phonon is considered the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\n\nA **Skyrmion**, by contrast, is not a Goldstone boson. It is a topologically stable, particle-like field configuration, often described as a topological soliton. While skyrmions arise in theories where symmetries are spontaneously broken (for example, as stable configurations of the pion field, which is composed of Goldstone bosons), they are themselves massive and topologically distinct objects, not the massless modes that characterize Goldstone bosons.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not the direct particle manifestation (the Goldstone boson) of a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
