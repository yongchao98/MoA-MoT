    "Based on the detailed analysis of the underlying chemical processes, the correct statement is identified as follows:\n\n*   **Statement A: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This is incorrect. While the production of alpha-olefin comonomers (like 1-hexene) from ethylene is a major industrial process in the US, it is done in dedicated plants. These comonomers are then used in separate polymerization reactors. The \"combined system\" described, where a dual catalyst in a single reactor both creates the comonomer from ethylene and incorporates it into a polymer chain, is a subject of research and is not implemented on a large industrial scale.\n\n*   **Statement B: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This is incorrect. The essential step is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to alpha-olefins. Chromium-based catalysts used for this reaction are almost always activated by aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or other trialkylaluminum reagents.\n\n*   **Statement C: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is misleading in this context. While noble metals (Pd, Pt, Ru) are active catalysts in various olefin reactions, including polymerization and depolymerization, the specific, highly selective industrial process of converting ethylene to 1-hexene or 1-octene overwhelmingly relies on chromium catalysts. Palladium catalysts, for instance, are more commonly researched for copolymerizing ethylene with polar monomers. Thus, noble metals are not the key catalysts for the specific transformation required.\n\n*   **Statement D: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is correct. The key technology to create short-chain alpha-olefins (like 1-hexene) from ethylene is selective oligomerization. This is achieved industrially using catalysts based on Chromium (Cr), which is a Group VIa (or Group 6) transition metal. These catalyst systems require a co-catalyst or activator, which is typically an organoaluminum compound, to function.\n\n<<<D>>>"
