    "The problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics, governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after. Since the pion is at rest, its initial energy is just its rest mass energy (E = mc²). The energy of the products is the sum of their total energies (kinetic energy + rest mass energy).\n\n    *   E(π⁺) = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n    *   m(π⁺)c² = (KE(μ⁺) + m(μ⁺)c²) + E(ν)\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay is zero, as the pion is stationary. Therefore, the final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.\n\n    *   p(π⁺) = p(μ⁺) + p(ν) = 0\n    *   This implies |p(μ⁺)| = |p(ν)| = p\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** For any particle, the total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) are related by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n    *   For the neutrino, the rest mass is considered negligible (m(ν) ≈ 0). Therefore, its energy is simply E(ν) = pc.\n    *   For the muon, its total energy is E(μ⁺)² = (pc)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)².\n\n4.  **Solving for the Energies:**\n\n    *   From momentum conservation, we know the momentum `p` is the same for the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   Substitute E(ν) = pc into the energy conservation equation: m(π⁺)c² = E(μ⁺) + pc.\n    *   Rearrange this to get: pc = m(π⁺)c² - E(μ⁺).\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `pc` into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n        E(μ⁺)² = (m(π⁺)c² - E(μ⁺))² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n    *   Expand the equation:\n        E(μ⁺)² = (m(π⁺)c²)² - 2(m(π⁺)c²)E(μ⁺) + E(μ⁺)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n    *   The E(μ⁺)² terms cancel out. Rearranging to solve for E(μ⁺):\n        2(m(π⁺)c²)E(μ⁺) = (m(π⁺)c²)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n        E(μ⁺) = [(m(π⁺)c²)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²] / [2 * m(π⁺)c²]\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Now, we plug in the given rest mass values: m(π⁺)c² = 139.6 MeV and m(μ⁺)c² = 105.7 MeV.\n\n    *   E(μ⁺) = [(139.6)² + (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    *   E(μ⁺) = [19488.16 + 11172.49] / 279.2\n    *   E(μ⁺) = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\n    This is the total energy of the muon. To find its kinetic energy (KE), we subtract its rest mass energy:\n\n    *   KE(μ⁺) = E(μ⁺) - m(μ⁺)c²\n    *   KE(μ⁺) = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = **4.12 MeV**\n\n6.  **Neutrino Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy. We can find this from the initial energy conservation equation:\n\n    *   KE(ν) = E(ν) = m(π⁺)c² - E(μ⁺)\n    *   KE(ν) = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = **29.78 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This result is confirmed by multiple physics resources.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
