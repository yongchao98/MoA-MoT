    "### Product of Aza-Cope Rearrangement Identified\n\nThe reaction of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene will undergo an aza-Cope rearrangement to form 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine, which corresponds to option B after tautomerization.\n\nThe Cope rearrangement is a thermally induced-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene. The aza-Cope variant features a nitrogen atom within the six-atom chain. The starting material, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, contains the necessary 1,5-diene system composed of the vinyl group attached to the nitrogen and the double bond within the bicyclic ring structure (C5=C6).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Identification of the system:** The atoms involved in the rearrangement are the terminal carbon of the vinyl group (atom 1), the internal vinyl carbon (atom 2), the nitrogen (atom 3), the bridgehead carbon C1 (atom 4), carbon C6 (atom 5), and carbon C5 (atom 6).\n2.  **Bond reorganization:** The rearrangement occurs through a chair-like transition state. The key steps are the cleavage of the single bond between the nitrogen (N2, atom 3) and the bridgehead carbon (C1, atom 4) and the simultaneous formation of a new single bond between the terminal vinyl carbon (atom 1) and carbon C5 (atom 6).\n3.  **Pi bond shift:** The double bond from the vinyl group shifts to form a C=N double bond (an imine), and the double bond from the bicyclic ring shifts to the C1=C6 position.\n4.  **Product Formation:** This bond reorganization breaks open the strained bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring system, which helps to drive the reaction forward. The initial product is a seven-membered ring containing an endocyclic imine and a diene.\n5.  **Tautomerization:** This seven-membered ring intermediate is unstable and rapidly rearranges to a more stable, fused bicyclic system. The process involves an intramolecular cyclization (a Mannich-type reaction is a related process) followed by proton shifts (tautomerization) to yield the final, thermodynamically favored product.\n6.  **Final Structure:** The resulting structure is 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine. This molecule consists of a six-membered dihydropyridine ring fused to a five-membered cyclopentane ring. The specific stereochemistry of the starting material influences the stereochemistry of the final product.\n\nSuch rearrangements are synthetically valuable for creating complex N-containing polycyclic skeletons from simpler starting materials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
