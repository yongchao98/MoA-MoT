    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate. The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at C6 is secondary (bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only be formed by deprotonating at the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate formed at C6 acts as a nucleophile (a Michael donor). It attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor), which is an α,β-unsaturated ester. This type of conjugate addition is favored for stabilized nucleophiles like enolates.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After the reaction mixture is neutralized, the intermediate enolate is protonated to yield the final product.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (A):** The resulting product is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To match the naming convention in the options, the molecule is named as a propanoate derivative. In this system, the cyclohexyl ring is a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   The attachment point on the ring is designated C1.\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) gets the next lowest possible number, which is C2.\n    *   The substituents from the original ketone are located: the ethyl and methyl groups are at C3 (originally C2), and the other methyl group is at C1 (originally C6).\n    *   Thus, the correct name for the cyclohexyl substituent is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches options A and B. Options C and D are incorrect as they name it a 4-oxocyclohexyl derivative.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This creates a resonance-stabilized carbanion, [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻, which will act as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. Subsequent protonation by water yields the final product. The resulting structure is CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Product Naming (B):** To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering begins from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   This places a methyl substituent at C3 and a nitro substituent at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for product B in options B and C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct product for reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct product for reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nCombining these two correct products, we find that option B provides the correct names for both A and B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
