    "This is a multi-step chemical puzzle that requires identifying an element, Y, and its five binary fluoride compounds (A1 to A5). The solution hinges on a combination of quantitative analysis and knowledge of chemical properties.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Substance A2**\n\nThe key piece of information is that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\n\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y. Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\nM(Y) = (19.00n / 0.3196) - 19.00n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe must now test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible atomic mass for an element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, which is unlikely to form five fluorides and the described compounds).\n*   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, which does not fit the subsequent clues).\n*   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n\nLet's verify this by calculating the precise mass percentage of fluorine in antimony trifluoride (SbF₃):\n*   Molar mass of SbF₃ = 121.76 + (3 × 19.00) = 178.76 g/mol.\n*   Mass fraction of F = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n\nThis calculated value of 31.88% is an excellent match for the given 31.96%. Therefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Other Substances**\n\nWith Y=Sb and A2=SbF₃, we can deduce the identities of the other substances. The known binary fluorides of antimony are primarily SbF₃ and SbF₅. For the purpose of this problem, we assume the existence of five binary compounds as stated.\n\n*   **A1**: This bright-red substance decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride of antimony, which would be SbF₅. While SbF₅ is typically described as a colorless liquid, the qualitative descriptions in such problems can sometimes be idealized or misleading. The decomposition reaction described (SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂) occurs at high temperatures, not at 293 K, which is another discrepancy, but the chemical identity is the most plausible.\n*   **A3**: This compound is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Sb) and can interact with xenon. The direct, vigorous fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to react with xenon fluorides, thus it \"interacts with xenon\". So, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The problem states that adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 yields A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction where an element in a zero oxidation state reacts with one of its compounds to form a product of an intermediate oxidation state. Given the known chemistry of antimony, a likely, albeit stoichiometrically simplified, intended reaction involves Sb and SbF₅ to produce SbF₃. However, the question asks for the molecular weight of **A4**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nA4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony. The most common and stable fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. Let's examine their molecular weights:\n*   **MW of SbF₃**: 178.76 g/mol.\n*   **MW of SbF₅**: 216.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's compare these to the given ranges:\n*   A) 220-240\n*   B) 160-180\n*   C) 140-160\n*   D) 110-130\n\nThe molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within the range of **160-180**. The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any of the provided ranges. This strongly suggests that A4 is SbF₃.\n\nAlthough there are contradictions in the qualitative descriptions of the reactions and properties, the quantitative data (mass percentage and molecular weight) point consistently towards this solution.\n\nThe molecular weight of substance A4 is therefore in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
