    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Analysis:** The combination of a bis(dihalomethyl) aromatic-like precursor with NaI is a known method for generating a highly reactive diene for use in Diels-Alder reactions. Although the starting material name `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is unusual, it is an isomer of the more common `1,2-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene` (`α,α,α',α'-tetrabromo-o-xylene`). Under thermal conditions, it is plausible that it serves as a source for **o-xylylene** (also known as o-quinodimethane).\n*   **Reaction:** The norbornadiene derivative has two double bonds and acts as a dienophile. It reacts with two equivalents of the in-situ generated o-xylylene in a double Diels-Alder reaction. The additions occur on the two equivalent double bonds (C2=C3 and C5=C6) of the norbornadiene skeleton.\n*   **Product 1:** A complex, symmetric polycyclic molecule with a 7-tert-butoxy-norbornane core fused to two identical ring systems derived from the o-xylylene.\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** Aqueous acid is used for the cleavage of tert-butyl ethers.\n*   **Reaction:** The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** The same polycyclic skeleton as **1**, but with a hydroxyl group at C7.\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation.\n*   **Reaction:** The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\n*   **Product 3:** The same polycyclic skeleton, with a carbonyl group at the C7 position. This molecule is a derivative of norbornan-7-one.\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 is heated at 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:** The thermal decomposition of Diels-Alder adducts of norbornadiene systems, particularly 7-norbornanone derivatives, often proceeds via a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. Furthermore, 7-norbornadienone itself is known to be thermally unstable and extrudes carbon monoxide.\n*   **Reaction Cascade:**\n    1.  **Retro-Diels-Alder:** The heating of product **3** causes a cycloreversion, breaking it down into its constituent parts: norbornadien-7-one and two molecules of o-xylylene.\n    2.  **Decarbonylation:** At 150°C, norbornadien-7-one readily decomposes by extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene (C₆H₆).\n    3.  **Dimerization:** The highly reactive o-xylylene molecules cannot be isolated under these conditions and will react with themselves. A known thermal reaction of o-xylylene is dimerization followed by stabilization. One plausible product formed under these conditions is (Z)-dibenzo[a,e]cyclooct-5-ene (C₁₆H₁₄), which can be formed from the initial C₁₆H₁₆ dimer by losing a molecule of hydrogen (H₂) at the elevated temperature to achieve greater aromatic stabilization.\n\nThe question asks for the \"final product 4\". While benzene and CO are also formed, the most complex organic product derived from the elaborate starting materials is the o-xylylene dimer. We will analyze this structure.\n\n### **Analysis of Product 4**\n\nLet's assume **Product 4** is (Z)-dibenzo[a,e]cyclooct-5-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:** It consists of a central 8-membered ring containing one cis-double bond and two methylene (-CH₂-) groups, fused to two benzene rings.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the center of the double bond and the center of the opposing single bond in the 8-membered ring.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** We count the sets of non-equivalent protons based on the C₂ symmetry.\n    1.  **Aromatic Protons:** There are two benzene rings, which are equivalent due to the C₂ axis. Within a single benzene ring, all four protons are chemically distinct because there is no local plane of symmetry. Therefore, there are **4** distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n    2.  **Methylene Protons:** There are two -CH₂- groups, which are equivalent by the C₂ axis. The two protons within each methylene group are diastereotopic (they are on a prochiral carbon in a chiral molecule) and are thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2** distinct signals for the methylene protons.\n    3.  **Vinylic Protons:** There are two protons on the double bond. These are interchanged by the C₂ axis, making them chemically equivalent. This gives **1** distinct signal for the vinylic protons.\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (methylene) + 1 (vinylic) = **7**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
