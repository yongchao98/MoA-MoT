    "The user has presented a four-step chemical synthesis problem and is asking for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**: This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. The product, **Product 1**, is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**: When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a classic reaction called the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the ring, converting the six-membered cyclohexanone ring into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. Thus, **Product 2** is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**: This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Therefore, **Product 3** is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**: This reagent is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) due to the bulky tri-tert-butoxy groups. The reaction converts cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride into **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde** (C₆H₁₀O). Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in different electronic environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde:\n\n*   The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   We can count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n    1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). This is in a unique chemical environment. (1 proton)\n    2.  The single **proton on C1**, the carbon atom of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group. This is also unique. (1 proton)\n    3.  The protons on **C2 and C5**. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center (even in a racemic mixture). One proton is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. These two are not equivalent. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* protons form another set. This gives us two distinct types of hydrogens. (4 protons total, in 2 sets)\n    4.  The protons on **C3 and C4**. These carbons are also equivalent due to the symmetry plane. Similar to C2 and C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The two protons *cis* to the C1-CHO axis are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are also equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens. (4 protons total, in 2 sets)\n\nSumming these up, we have:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
