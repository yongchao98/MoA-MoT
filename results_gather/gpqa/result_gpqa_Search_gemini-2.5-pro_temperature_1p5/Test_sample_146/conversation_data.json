    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the annihilation process.\n\n### 1. Initial State Energy\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is considered negligible. The proton is assumed to be at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n\n*   $E_i = (\\text{rest energy of proton}) + (\\text{rest energy of antiproton})$\n*   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n*   $E_i = 938 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 2. Final State Energy\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. According to the problem, the rest energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is 300 MeV. The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles. Since momentum is conserved and the initial momentum was near zero, the four resulting particles will share the available energy.\n\n*   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nWhere $E_A$ is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of a single particle A.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nBy equating the initial and final energies, we can find the total energy of each particle A.\n\n*   $E_i = E_f$\n*   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n*   $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNext, we use the Lorentz factor to find the velocity ($v$). The formula for the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n\n*   $(v/c) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   $(v/c) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}}$\n*   $(v/c) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}}$\n*   $(v/c) = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n*   $(v/c) = \\sqrt{0.591}$\n*   $(v/c) \\approx 0.769$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light ($c$). Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
