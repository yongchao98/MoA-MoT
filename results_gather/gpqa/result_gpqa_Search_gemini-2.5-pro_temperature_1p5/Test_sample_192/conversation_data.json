    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This fundamental relationship can be written as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.** The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In observational astronomy, this refers to the number of stars found within a specific parallax interval, meaning the number of stars per unit of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`). So, we can write this relationship as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars per unit distance to the number of stars per unit parallax.** We want to find how the number of stars changes with distance, which is the quantity `dN/dr`. To get from `dN/d(plx)` to `dN/dr`, we use the chain rule from calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.** Since `plx = 1/r` (ignoring constants of proportionality), we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation.** We can now substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` (from step 2) and `d(plx)/dr` (from step 4) into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n6.  **Express the final relationship in terms of distance (`r`).** To get the final relationship, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation from step 5:\n    `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (-1/r²) = (r⁵) * (-1/r²) = -r³`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as distance increases, the corresponding parallax value decreases, which is expected. The magnitude of the number of stars per unit range of distance is what matters. Therefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as `r³`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
