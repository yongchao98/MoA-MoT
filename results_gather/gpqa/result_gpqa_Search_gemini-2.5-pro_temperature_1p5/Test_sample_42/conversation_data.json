    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, we must follow a systematic approach based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\nThe molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority and will therefore determine the parent name of the molecule. The parent name will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as locant 1 (C1).\n\n### 2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents\nThe problem provides the relative positions of all substituents:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** C1\n*   **Para to -COOH:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para, so it is at C4.\n*   **Ortho to -COOH:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are ortho, placing them at C2 and C6.\n*   **Meta to -COOH:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and cyano (-CN) groups are meta, placing them at C3 and C5.\n*   **Confirmation:** The description states that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the cyano group. This helps resolve the specific positions:\n    *   For the cyano group to be ortho to the C4 methoxy group, it must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C3, its other ortho position is C2. For the hydroxyl group to also be ortho to the cyano group, it must be at C2.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C5, its other ortho position is C6. For the hydroxyl group to also be ortho to the cyano group, it must be at C6.\n\n### 3. Apply Numbering Rules to Break the Tie\nWe have two possible arrangements that fit the description. To decide the correct numbering, we must give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **Arrangement 1:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n    *   The locant set is (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n*   **Arrangement 2:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n    *   The locant set is (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the identical locant set (2,3,4,5,6), we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents to break the tie. The substituent that comes first alphabetically is given the lower locant at the first point of difference.\n\nThe substituents are named as prefixes: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\n*   In **Arrangement 1**, the alphabetically first substituent, \"cyano,\" is at C3.\n*   In **Arrangement 2**, \"cyano\" is at C5.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, **Arrangement 1** is the correct numbering scheme.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\nThe correct positions are:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\nThe prefixes for the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not numerical order.\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these prefixes alphabetically with the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives the final IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
