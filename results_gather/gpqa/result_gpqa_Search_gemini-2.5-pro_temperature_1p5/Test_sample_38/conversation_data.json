    "To determine the value of the constant \"a\", we use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The Born rule states that the probability of finding a particle in a specific region is the integral of the square of the magnitude of its wave function over that region. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the total probability of finding a particle in this interval must be 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability density function, which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nThe complex conjugate, Ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ(x) * Ψ*(x)\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1 + x)) - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1 + x)) - 0.25*i²\nSince i² = -1:\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition. The integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve this integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n= [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x]\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n= [a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this result equal to 1 and solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
