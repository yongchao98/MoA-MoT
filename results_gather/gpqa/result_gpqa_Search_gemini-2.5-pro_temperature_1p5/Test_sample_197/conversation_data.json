    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],     β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,   β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,   β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]. Since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration to be 0.1 M.\n\nThe fraction (α_n) of a specific complex [Co(SCN)ₙ] is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe need to calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to n=2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1 (for free Co²⁺)\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to find the denominator (often called the alpha function):\nΣ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator for the [Co(SCN)₂] fraction is β₂[SCN⁻]², which we already calculated as 0.4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]:\nFraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
