    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants\n*   **Acid 1 (Strong):** 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl\n*   **Acid 2 (Strong):** 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4\n*   **Base (Strong):** 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of H+ Ions from the Acids\n*   **From HCl:** Since HCl is a monoprotic acid (provides one H+ ion per molecule), the calculation is:\n    *   Moles of H+ = (500 mL / 1000 mL/L) \\* 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H+\n*   **From H2SO4:** H2SO4 is a diprotic acid (provides two H+ ions per molecule).\n    *   Moles of H2SO4 = (300 mL / 1000 mL/L) \\* 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.09 mol \\* 2 = 0.18 mol H+\n*   **Total Moles of H+:** 0.1 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol H+\n\n### 3. Calculate the Moles of OH- Ions from the Base\n*   **From Ba(OH)2:** Ba(OH)2 is a diacidic base (provides two OH- ions per molecule).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = (200 mL / 1000 mL/L) \\* 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.1 mol \\* 2 = 0.20 mol OH-\n\n### 4. Determine the Limiting Reactant and Moles of Water Formed\nThe neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.\n*   Moles of H+ available = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.20 mol\nThe OH- ions are the limiting reactant, as there are fewer moles of OH- than H+. Therefore, the reaction will consume all the OH- ions.\n*   **Moles of water (H2O) formed = 0.20 mol**\n\n### 5. Account for the Enthalpy of Precipitation\nA side reaction occurs between the barium ions from Ba(OH)2 and the sulfate ions from H2SO4, forming a precipitate of barium sulfate (BaSO4).\n*   Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.1 mol (from 0.1 mol of Ba(OH)2)\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol (from 0.09 mol of H2SO4)\nThe sulfate ion is the limiting reactant for this precipitation.\n*   Moles of BaSO4 precipitated = 0.09 mol\n\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the enthalpy of neutralization and the enthalpy of precipitation.\n*   **Enthalpy of Neutralization (ΔH_neut):** The standard value for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n    *   ΔH_neut = 0.20 mol H2O \\* (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n*   **Enthalpy of Precipitation (ΔH_precip):** The enthalpy change for the precipitation of BaSO4 is -4.64 kcal/mol.\n    *   ΔH_precip = 0.09 mol BaSO4 \\* (-4.64 kcal/mol) = -0.4176 kcal\n\n### 6. Calculate the Total Enthalpy Change\nTotal Enthalpy = ΔH_neut + ΔH_precip\nTotal Enthalpy = -2.74 kcal + (-0.4176 kcal) = -3.1576 kcal\n\nReviewing the options, the value calculated from neutralization alone (-2.74 kcal) is very close to option B (-2.72 kcal). The slight difference is likely due to using a standard value of -13.6 kcal/mol instead of -13.7 kcal/mol.\n*   0.20 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal.\n\nIt appears the question is primarily focused on the heat of neutralization and neglects the heat from the precipitation of BaSO4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
