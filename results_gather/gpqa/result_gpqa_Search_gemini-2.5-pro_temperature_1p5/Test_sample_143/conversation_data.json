    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between decay width (Γ) and lifetime (τ):**\n\nThe lifetime of a particle (τ), which is its mean decay time in its own rest frame, is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). This relationship is derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and is given by:\n\nτ = ħ / Γ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and velocity (β):**\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) describes how much time, length, and relativistic mass change for an object in motion. It is calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and its rest mass (m, where the rest energy is mc²):\n\nγ = E / mc²\n\nThe particle's velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, denoted by β (β = v/c). It is related to γ by:\n\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n\n**3. Determine the mean decay distance in the laboratory frame:**\n\nDue to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed in the laboratory frame will have a longer apparent lifetime (t_lab) than its proper lifetime (τ):\n\nt_lab = γτ\n\nThe mean decay distance (d) in the lab frame is its velocity (v) multiplied by this lab-frame lifetime:\n\nd = v * t_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = γβcτ\n\nA convenient way to calculate this is to combine c with ħ, using the value ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m):\n\nd = γβ * (ħc / Γ)\n\n**4. Substitute the given values into the equations:**\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy Eₓ = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy mₓc² = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Decay width Γₓ = 320 MeV\n\n**Calculation steps:**\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    γ = Eₓ / mₓc² = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20/3\n\n*   **Calculate β:**\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) = √391 / 20\n\n*   **Calculate the product γβ:**\n    γβ = (20/3) * (√391 / 20) = √391 / 3\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n    d = (√391 / 3) * (ħc / Γₓ)\n    d ≈ (19.7737 / 3) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    d ≈ 6.5912 * (0.61656) fm\n    d ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
