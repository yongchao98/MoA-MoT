    "The key to solving this problem lies in a fundamental principle of radioactive decay: it is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent probability of decaying in the next instant.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the probability that a new atom of this type would decay within a 150-minute period.\n\n**1. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nFirst, we use the information provided to find the decay constant, λ, which governs the rate of decay. The probability of decay, P(t), within a time, t, is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe know that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the exponential term:\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nNow, we solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nCalculating this gives:\nλ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\nλ ≈ 0.003857 min⁻¹\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes**\n\nAs established by the memoryless principle, the question is now simply: what is the probability of this atom decaying in a 150-minute interval? We use the same formula with our calculated decay constant λ and a time t = 150 minutes.\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\nP(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\n\nSimplify the exponent:\nP(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule (a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)):\nP(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince e^ln(x) = x:\nP(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\nP(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393 corresponds to 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
