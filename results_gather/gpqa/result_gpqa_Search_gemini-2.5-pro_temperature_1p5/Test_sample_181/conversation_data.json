    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC) under a specific set of ideal conditions. To determine which statement is true, each condition must be evaluated based on the fundamental assumptions of the Mott-Gurney law.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation are:\n*   **Single-carrier device**: The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-free solid**: The derivation assumes an ideal semiconductor or insulator with no trap states in the band gap that could capture charge carriers. If traps are present, the current-voltage behavior is modified, leading to trap-limited SCLC.\n*   **Ohmic contact (no injection barrier)**: For the current to be limited by the space charge within the bulk of the material, carriers must be freely supplied by the contact. This type of injecting contact is called an Ohmic contact, which has no energy barrier for charge injection. A Schottky contact, by contrast, has an injection barrier and would lead to injection-limited current, not space-charge-limited current.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current**: The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism is carrier drift under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current is considered negligible. It's important not to confuse this with the drift current itself, which is the primary mechanism being described.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This statement is incorrect because the SCLC is fundamentally a drift current; therefore, the drift current is dominant, not negligible.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, which violates the assumption of an Ohmic contact required for SCLC.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the basic Mott-Gurney law applies only to single-carrier devices.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately includes all the core conditions: it specifies a trap-free material, a single type of carrier, no injection barrier (which is equivalent to an ideal Ohmic contact), and that the diffusion current is negligible.\n\nTherefore, statement D correctly describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
