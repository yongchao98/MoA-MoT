    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a truncated and non-functional protein. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on the protein sequence, using the standard genetic code to translate the DNA codons.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence and its corresponding amino acid sequence is:\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The `TTT` codon changed to `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The `CTC` codon (Leucine) changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While this might affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be partially active.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The `TTT` codon changed to `TTC` (silent mutation).\n    *   The `CTC` codon (Leucine) changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop signal, causing protein synthesis to halt. The result is a severely shortened, incomplete protein that is almost certain to be non-functional, especially when it occurs so early in the gene.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant has multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   `TCT` (Serine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   These are all **missense mutations**, resulting in several amino acid substitutions. While multiple changes make it more likely that the protein's function is disrupted compared to a single change, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr**...\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant also contains multiple **missense mutations**.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Similar to Mutant 3, this will alter the protein sequence but may not completely inactivate it.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - **Thr**...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe goal is to eliminate the compound, which is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the protein that synthesizes it. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity among the given options. The missense mutations in the other mutants only substitute amino acids, which may or may not render the protein non-functional.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
