    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Sodium amide is a very strong base that initiates the reaction.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n### Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two different *ortho* positions:\n*   **C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to the formation of two distinct benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Although a C-D bond is stronger than a C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction path still occurs. This elimination also results in the loss of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the resulting intermediate is a standard **benzyne** molecule, as the deuterium atom has been removed.\n\n### Step 2: Addition of the Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide anion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the highly reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (ammonia).\n\n1.  **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6).\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1 and creates a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH₂ and -D groups are ortho to each other).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This places the amino group at C6 and creates a carbanion at C1. Protonation yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH₂ and -D groups are meta to each other).\n\n2.  **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** The amide ion attacks either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2).\n    *   Regardless of whether the attack is at C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation results in the formation of **aniline** (aminobenzene), a molecule with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes of both pathways, three unique organic products can be formed:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuterioaniline\n*   3-Deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
