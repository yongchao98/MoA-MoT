    "To determine the correct chemical formula, we need to analyze the data from each characterization technique and see which formula is consistent with all the observations.\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. This broad peak often overlaps with C-H stretching peaks.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically absorbs between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-hydrogens:** The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** A fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 is very commonly observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids and corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n4.  **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    The degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a molecule containing only C, H, and O).\n\n    Let's analyze the clues from the spectra:\n    *   A C=O double bond (from the carbonyl group) accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=C double bond (from the alkene group) accounts for another **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the DoU for each of the given options:\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The spectral data strongly indicate that the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   The requirement of two degrees of unsaturation eliminates options B and C.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates option D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   Formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that has both two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
