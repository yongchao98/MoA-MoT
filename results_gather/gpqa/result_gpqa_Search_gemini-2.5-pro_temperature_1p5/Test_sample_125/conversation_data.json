    "### Analysis of Reactions and Products\n\n#### Reaction I\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone with the stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Because the starting material is chiral, the hydride attack on the carbonyl group is diastereoselective, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n**Products from Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.**\n\n#### Reaction II\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent that converts ketones to alcohols, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters in the product, pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture. The (2S, 4R) isomer has a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound.\n\n**Products from Reaction II: 3 stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).**\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined, resulting in a mixture of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nA normal-phase HPLC column is an achiral stationary phase that separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Constitutional Isomers:** The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) have different chemical formulas and structures, so they will be separated from each other.\n*   **Diastereomers:** Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso compound ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will give one peak, and the unseparated pair of enantiomers will give another peak, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, all these groups will be resolved.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The CSP interacts differently with each stereoisomer, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is diastereomeric to all other compounds and will be separated.\n*   The pair of enantiomers from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks by the chiral column.\n*   Therefore, all five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
