    "The solution to this problem involves a two-step application of fundamental principles in planetary astronomy: the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Relating Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (a). For planets orbiting the same star with an identical albedo, the relationship simplifies considerably. The energy absorbed by the planet is proportional to 1/a², and the temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the absorbed energy. This leads to the following proportionality:\n\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = a^(-1/2)\n\n    This means that the ratio of the semi-major axes (orbital distances for circular orbits) of two planets can be found from the inverse square of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n\n    (a₂/a₁) = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)²\n\n2.  **Calculating the Ratios of Orbital Distances:**\n    Using the given temperature ratios, we can calculate the ratios of the orbital distances for the adjacent planets.\n\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2, with T_eq₁ / T_eq₂ ≈ 1.4:\n        a₂/a₁ ≈ (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3, with T_eq₂ / T_eq₃ ≈ 2.3:\n        a₃/a₂ ≈ (2.3)² = 5.29\n\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distances of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we multiply these two ratios:\n    a₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be written as P² ∝ a³, or P ∝ a^(3/2). The information regarding the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous, as the planets' masses are negligible compared to their host star.\n\n    The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is therefore:\n\n    P₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2)\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting the calculated value for the ratio of the orbital distances:\n\n    P₃/P₁ ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.4355\n\nBy rounding to one decimal place, the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
