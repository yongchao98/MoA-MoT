    "To find the expectation value of the operator for the given spin-half particle state, we follow these steps.\n\n**1. Define the state and operator:**\nThe state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩\n\nThe operator is:\nA = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\n\nWhere |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σ_z operator, and σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.\n\n**2. Pauli Matrices:**\nIn the standard basis where |↑⟩ is represented by the column vector and |↓⟩ by, the Pauli matrices are:\n*   σ_x = [,]\n*   σ_z = [, [0, -1]]\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value:**\nThe expectation value of an operator A for a state |ψ⟩ is calculated as ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. We can calculate the expectation values for σ_z and σ_x separately and then combine them.\n\nThe expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.\n\n**4. Expectation value of σ_z:**\nThe expectation value of σ_z is given by:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩\nFirst, apply σ_z to |ψ⟩:\nσ_z|ψ⟩ = σ_z(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_z|↑⟩) + (√3/2)(σ_z|↓⟩)\nSince |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively:\nσ_z|ψ⟩ = 0.5(+1)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(-1)|↓⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ - (√3/2)|↓⟩\nNow, calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|)(0.5|↑⟩ - (√3/2)|↓⟩)\nUsing the orthogonality of the states (⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0) and their normalization (⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1), we get:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**5. Expectation value of σ_x:**\nThe expectation value of σ_x is given by:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩\nFirst, apply σ_x to |ψ⟩:\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x(0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩) = 0.5(σ_x|↑⟩) + (√3/2)(σ_x|↓⟩)\nWe know that σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩\nNow, calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|)((√3/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩)\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (2√3)/4 = (√3)/2\n\n**6. Final Calculation:**\nNow, substitute the individual expectation values back into the expression for ⟨A⟩:\n⟨A⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5((√3)/2)\n⟨A⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨A⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives -0.7.\n\n<<<C>>>"
