    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which, if any, is in excess after neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate initial moles of each component:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles of CH3COOH\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles of H⁺\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely to provide two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles of OH⁻\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reaction:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acid protons (H⁺), neutralizing the strong acid first, followed by the weak acid.\n\n*   Total moles of acid = Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH\n*   Total moles of acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 moles\n\nNow, compare the total moles of acid with the total moles of base:\n\n*   Total moles of acid (H⁺) = 0.130 mol\n*   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of base than acid, the base is in excess.\n\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of H⁺\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 moles of OH⁻\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n\nThe final solution will be basic due to the excess strong base (OH⁻). The contribution of hydroxide ions from the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   First, find the total volume of the mixed solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   Next, calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
