    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let `v1` be the velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) and `v2` be the velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m) in the laboratory frame of reference. We want to find the velocity of the second astronaut as seen by the first.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity (`v_rel`) is:\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven values:\n*   `v1` = 0.6c\n*   `v2` = 0.5c\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ -0.1428c`\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. The negative sign indicates that from the perspective of the first (faster) astronaut, the second astronaut appears to be moving backward.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a single particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass `m1` = 2m\n*   Velocity `v1` = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1`:\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate the energy `E1`:\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5mc²`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass `m2` = 3m\n*   Velocity `v2` = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2`:\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate the energy `E2`:\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc² = 5.9641mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is 5.96 mc².\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed `v_rel` is approximately **0.14c**.\n*   The total energy `E` is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nThis matches the values given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
