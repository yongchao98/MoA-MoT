    "To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a quick detection of a new retrovirus, the most effective and scientifically sound approach is B. This involves first identifying the virus through cDNA sequencing and then developing a real-time PCR kit.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the correct approach and the issues with the other options:\n\n*   **A) First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients. You then design a nested PCR kit based on the information for quick diagnosis.**\n    *   **Flaw:** Identifying a virus based on symptoms is unreliable. Different viruses can cause similar symptoms, and a definitive diagnosis requires molecular identification. Nested PCR, while sensitive, is more complex, slower, and has a higher risk of contamination compared to real-time PCR, making it less ideal for a \"quick\" diagnostic kit for a large-scale outbreak.\n\n*   **B) First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n    *   **Correct Approach:** Retroviruses have an RNA genome. The first critical step is to determine the virus's unique genetic sequence. This is properly done by converting the viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and then sequencing it. This provides the precise genetic information needed to design a highly specific diagnostic test. The second step, developing a real-time PCR (also called qPCR or, in this case, RT-qPCR) kit, is the gold standard for rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of viral genetic material. This method allows for fast and reliable diagnosis, which is crucial during an outbreak.\n\n*   **C) First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection. You then develop an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n    *   **Flaw:** This method detects the body's immune response, not the virus itself. IgG antibodies typically take a longer time (weeks) to develop after an infection begins. Therefore, an IgG-based test is not suitable for *quick* or *early* diagnosis of an acute infection. It is more useful for determining if someone has had a past infection or has developed immunity.\n\n*   **D) First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing. You then develop a PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n    *   **Flaw:** The primary genetic material of a retrovirus is RNA, not DNA. Therefore, you cannot directly perform DNA sequencing to identify the virus from a patient sample. The viral RNA must first be converted to cDNA. This makes the initial step of this option fundamentally incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the correct workflow is to first accurately sequence the novel RNA virus (via cDNA) and then use this sequence information to design and deploy a rapid, specific, and quantitative detection method like real-time RT-PCR.\n\n<<<B>>>"
