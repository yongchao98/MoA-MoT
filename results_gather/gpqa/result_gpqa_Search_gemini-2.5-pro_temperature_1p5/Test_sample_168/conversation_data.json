    "The question asks to compare the total energy spectrum of the two `E` particles in two different nuclear decays:\n1.  **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n2.  **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n\nHere, `A` and `B` are heavy nucleons, while `E`, `V`, and `M` are light particles.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectrum's Nature (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\nIn a particle decay, the released energy (the Q-value) is distributed among the kinetic energies of the products.\n*   In the original decay, the final state has at least three distinct participants sharing the energy (the two `B` nuclei, the two `E` particles, and the two `V` particles). When more than two particles are present in the final state, their energies are not fixed by conservation of energy and momentum. The two `V` particles can carry away a variable amount of energy, from zero up to a maximum. Consequently, the remaining energy available to the two `E` particles also varies, leading to a **continuous** energy spectrum. This is stated in the problem and is characteristic of decays like standard two-neutrino double beta decay.\n*   In the variant decay, the final state consists of the `2B` nuclei, the two `E` particles, and the single particle `M`. Since there are still more than two bodies in the final state, the energy will be shared in a variable way among them. This means the total energy spectrum of the `E` particles will also remain **continuous**.\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and B, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectrum's Endpoint\n\nThe endpoint of the spectrum (`Q`) represents the maximum possible total kinetic energy of the two `E` particles. This maximum occurs when the other light emitted particles (`2V` or `M`) carry away the minimum possible energy (zero kinetic energy and zero rest mass energy). The total energy released in the decay is given by the change in rest mass:\n\n`Q = (mass_initial - mass_final) * c^2`\n\nLet's compare the Q-values for the two decays:\n\n1.  **Original Decay Endpoint (Q₁):**\n    `Q₁ = m(2A)c² - [m(2B)c² + m(2E)c² + m(2V)c²]`\n    The problem describes `V` as a \"much lighter particle,\" which is consistent with neutrinos, which have a very small but non-zero rest mass. Thus, `m(2V) > 0`.\n\n2.  **Variant Decay Endpoint (Q₂):**\n    `Q₂ = m(2A)c² - [m(2B)c² + m(2E)c² + m(M)c²]`\n    The problem explicitly states that the exotic particle `M` is **massless**, meaning `m(M) = 0`.\n\n**Comparison:**\nSince the mass of the two `V` particles is greater than the mass of the one `M` particle (`m(2V) > m(M)`), the total rest mass of the final products is smaller in the variant decay. A smaller final rest mass results in a larger release of energy.\n\nTherefore, `Q₂ > Q₁`.\n\nThe endpoint of the `E` particle energy spectrum is higher for the variant decay than for the original decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectrum's Shape\n\nThe distribution of energy among the final particles is governed by phase space considerations. The variant decay (`... -> 2E + M`) has fewer light particles in the final state than the original decay (`... -> 2E + 2V`). With fewer particles to share the energy, it is statistically more likely for the `E` particles to carry away a larger fraction of the total available energy. This results in an \"adjusted shape\" for the spectrum, where the distribution is skewed towards higher energies compared to the original decay.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these points:\n*   The spectrum remains **continuous**.\n*   The shape is **adjusted** (peaking at higher energies).\n*   The endpoint **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
