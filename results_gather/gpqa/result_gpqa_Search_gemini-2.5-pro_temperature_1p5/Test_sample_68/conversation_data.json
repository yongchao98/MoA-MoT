    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we must first calculate the average distance the $X^0$ particle travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. This is known as the mean decay length.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for the time dilation effect due to the particle's relativistic speed. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n\n*   Total Energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy ($m_0c^2$) = 3.41 GeV\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)**\nIn the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber), the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor. Consequently, the distance it travels is also extended. The mean decay length (L) can be calculated using the particle's momentum, mass, and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n\nThe formula for the mean decay length is:\n$L = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} c \\tau_0$\n\nWhere:\n*   p is the momentum of the particle.\n*   c is the speed of light ($\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n*   $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime ($8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2}}{3.41} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{729 - 11.6281}}{3.41} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{717.3719}}{3.41} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n$L = \\frac{26.78}{3.41} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})$\n$L \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Minimum Resolution (x)**\nParticle decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance `x` before decaying is given by $e^{-x/L}$. To observe at least 30% of the decays, the track of the particle must be at least as long as the minimum resolution, `x`. Therefore, we set the probability of a particle surviving to at least distance `x` to be 0.30.\n\n$e^{-x/L} = 0.30$\n\nTo solve for `x`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-x/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$x = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx L \\cdot 1.204$\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated mean decay length L:\n$x \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.204$\n$x \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result is closest to option D. The minor discrepancy between the calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the option ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is likely due to a small variation in the problem's input values, potentially a typo where \"30%\" was intended to be \"1/3\" (approximately 33.3%). If the fraction of decays to observe was 1/3, the calculation would yield:\n$x = L \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986 \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$, which matches option D very closely.\n\nGiven the choices, option D is the correct order of magnitude and the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
