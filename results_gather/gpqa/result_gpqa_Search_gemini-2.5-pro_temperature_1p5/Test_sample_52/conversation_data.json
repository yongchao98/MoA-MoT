    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure Skeleton:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C₆H₄.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** The IR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two signals for aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other side, resulting in just two distinct signals (often two doublets).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons.\n        *   One is a **doublet**, meaning it is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets**, meaning it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one proton (causing the doublet split) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group, causing the quartet split).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). This fragment has the formula -C₃H₅.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One -CH₃ group is part of the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal, combined with the fact that there is an ester and no -CH₂ groups, strongly points to a **methyl ester** (-COOCH₃). This accounts for the ester group from the IR and the second methyl group. The formula for this substituent is -CO₂CH₃, which is C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂):** The spectrum explicitly shows **no signals** for -CH₂ groups. This is a critical constraint, ruling out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **-C₃H₅**\n*   A methyl ester group: **-C₂H₃O₂**\n\n### Calculating the Molecular Formula:\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from each fragment to determine the total molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from methyl ester)\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A search confirms that a potential structure fitting this data, (E)-Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, has this exact molecular formula.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing our calculated formula with the given options:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe deduced formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
