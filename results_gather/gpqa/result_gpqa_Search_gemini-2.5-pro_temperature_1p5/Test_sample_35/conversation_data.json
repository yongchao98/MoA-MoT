    "The observed absorption line energy allows for the identification of a specific atomic transition, which in turn indicates the type of interstellar medium being observed. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n*   **Identify the Atomic Transition:** The energy of an absorption line corresponds to a specific transition between energy levels in an atom or molecule. The given energy is approximately 3.9 micro-electron volts (µeV). It is crucial to determine the rest-frame energy of this transition. Since the observation is of a distant object (2.1 Gpc), the detected energy is redshifted. A distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a significant redshift (z ≈ 0.5). Accounting for this redshift, the emitted energy in the rest frame of the absorbing gas is higher. A well-known transition in radio astronomy is the 21-cm line, which arises from the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This transition has a rest energy of about 5.87 µeV. The observed energy of 3.9 µeV is consistent with the 5.87 µeV energy of the 21-cm line when accounting for cosmological redshift.\n\n*   **Characterize the Interstellar Medium:** The 21-cm line is a spectral line produced by neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). Therefore, the absorption is caused by a cloud of neutral atomic gas. The interstellar medium (ISM) has several components, or phases, with different temperatures and densities. These include the cold neutral medium (CNM), the warm neutral medium (WNM), and various ionized media.\n\n*   **Significance of an Absorption Line:** An absorption line is observed when a cooler foreground gas absorbs radiation from a hotter background source. In this case, the cool gas is the interstellar medium in a galaxy between the Earth and the distant object. The fact that the 21-cm line is seen in absorption implies that the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen is lower than the brightness temperature of the background radio source. This condition is characteristic of the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), which typically has temperatures of about 50-100 Kelvin. The Warm Neutral Medium (WNM), with temperatures around 6000-10000 K, is more commonly observed via its own 21-cm emission rather than in absorption.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Warm molecular interstellar medium:** This is incorrect. The 21-cm line is from atomic hydrogen, not molecular gas.\n    *   **B) Cold atomic interstellar medium:** This is the correct choice. The 21-cm line seen in absorption is a primary tracer of the cold atomic gas (CNM) in the interstellar medium.\n    *   **C) Cold molecular interstellar medium:** This is incorrect because the transition is from atomic, not molecular, hydrogen.\n    *   **D) Warm atomic interstellar medium:** This is less likely because warm gas is typically seen in emission. Seeing it in absorption would require an even hotter background source, and it's a much less common observation than CNM absorption. The term \"absorption line\" strongly points to a cold medium.\n\nBased on this analysis, the observation of a redshifted 21-cm absorption line points to the presence of a cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<B>>>"
