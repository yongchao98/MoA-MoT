    "The four-step reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n**Step 1:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) and then benzyl bromide (BnBr). NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, forming a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis to form a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl groups remain unchanged. Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl). This reaction converts the ketone into a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (tosylhydrazone) through a condensation reaction, where a molecule of water is eliminated. Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This is a Shapiro reaction. Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used to convert the tosylhydrazone into a vinyllithium intermediate, with the loss of nitrogen gas and toluenesulfinate. The subsequent aqueous workup protonates the vinyllithium species to form an alkene. This reaction effectively removes the ketone functionality and replaces it with a carbon-carbon double bond. Product 3 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The catalyst Pd/C with Hâ‚‚ gas reduces carbon-carbon double bonds. In Product 3, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be hydrogenated (reduced) to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, which converts them back to alcohols. Therefore, the benzyl ether group is cleaved to a hydroxymethyl group.\n\nThe final product, product 4, is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, specifically **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect, the tosylhydrazone group is removed in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct, this matches the deduced structure of Product 4.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect, this would result from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile on the ketone, not a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect, this is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
