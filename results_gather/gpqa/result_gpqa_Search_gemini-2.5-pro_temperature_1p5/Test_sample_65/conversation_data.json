    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry (1 and 2):** The SMEFT is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with the principles of special relativity. Therefore, all operators must be invariant under Poincare transformations, which include both Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. This is a foundational assumption in the construction of the theory.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, guarantees that any local, Lorentz-invariant theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry (3):** CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity inversion. It is known that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, for instance in the weak interactions of quarks. SMEFT, as an extension of the Standard Model, not only incorporates this violation but also introduces a large number of new, higher-dimensional operators that can violate CP symmetry. In fact, these new potential sources of CP violation are a significant area of study within the SMEFT framework.\n\nBased on these principles, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry, however, is not a required symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
