    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the initial state and parameters\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, E_M = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n*   The more massive fragment is m1, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\nWe can write the mass relationship in terms of rest-mass energy:\n*   m1*c² + m2*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We also know m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²).\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n*   2*(m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV\n*   3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n*   **m2*c² = 99 GeV**\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n*   **m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This is due to the conservation of energy.\n*   Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)\n*   Q = M*c² - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Since the options are in MeV, let's convert Q: **Q = 3000 MeV**.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2|.\n*   Therefore, p1² = p2².\n*   2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\n*   m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n*   T2_classical = (m1 / m2) * T1_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q\n*   T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3000 MeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct T1 using Relativistic Dynamics\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy T is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy: T = E - m*c².\n*   This gives the relativistic momentum-energy relation: (p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²).\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, |p1| = |p2|, which means (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)\n*   We know T2 = Q - T1 = 3000 MeV - T1. Let's substitute this and the mass-energy values (m1c²=198000 MeV, m2c²=99000 MeV).\n\nT1² + 2 * T1 * (198000) = (3000 - T1)² + 2 * (3000 - T1) * (99000)\nT1² + 396000 * T1 = (9,000,000 - 6000*T1 + T1²) + (594,000,000 - 198,000*T1)\n\nThe T1² terms on both sides cancel out:\n396,000 * T1 = 9,000,000 - 6,000*T1 + 594,000,000 - 198,000*T1\n396,000 * T1 = 603,000,000 - 204,000*T1\n\nNow, group the T1 terms:\n(396,000 + 204,000) * T1 = 603,000,000\n600,000 * T1 = 603,000,000\nT1 = 603,000,000 / 600,000\n**T1 (correct) = 1005 MeV**\n\n### 6. Find the difference\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value from the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1 (correct) - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
