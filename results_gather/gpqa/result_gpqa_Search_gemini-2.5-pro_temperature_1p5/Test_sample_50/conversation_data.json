    "The problem of calculating the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of image charges.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the physics:\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: A charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` induces charges on the sphere's surface. The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled as the field from the original charge `q` plus a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, located inside the sphere. This image charge is positioned and valued such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, as required for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For this configuration, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'`. The correct method requires accounting for the fact that the induced charge (and therefore the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The correct approach is to recognize that the total energy `U` is half the potential energy of the real charge `q` in the field of the induced charges (which is equivalent to the field of the image charge `q'`). This factor of 1/2 arises because the source of the potential (the induced charge) is itself created by the charge being brought in.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) created by the image charge `q'` is `V'`. The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V' = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   The total potential energy `U` is `(1/2) * q * V'`.\n\n4.  **Derivation**:\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `q' = -q * R/d`\n        `d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   Calculate the potential `V'` at the position of `q`:\n        `V' = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n        `V' = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option D. The alternative method of integrating the force on the charge `q` from infinity to `d` yields the same result.\n\n    *   `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2 = -k*q^2*R*d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    *   `U = -W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n    *   `U = ∫[d, ∞] F(x) dx = ∫[d, ∞] -k*q^2*R*x / (x^2-R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Solving this integral gives: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis confirms that option D is the correct expression for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n<<<D>>>"
