    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a negative charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric field of charges inside it. The arrangement of the charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface ensures that the electric field within the body of the conductor is zero.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the property of electrostatic shielding, the charge `+q` on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly. The external field is produced only by this outer surface charge, and the uniform spherical distribution means it is independent of the position of the charge `+q` within the cavity.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if the entire charge of the shell were concentrated at its center.\n6.  **Calculating the Field:** The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at P is determined by the total charge on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nThe formula for the electric field of a point charge is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n\nSubstituting the values from our analysis:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
