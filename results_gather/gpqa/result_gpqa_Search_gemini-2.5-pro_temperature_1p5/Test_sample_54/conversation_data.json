    "### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must carefully analyze the provided ¹H NMR data and match it to the possible structures.\n\nThe experimental data is as follows:\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This signal is for a single proton in the alkene region (typically 4.5-7.0 ppm). Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, *J* = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons (protons on a double bond) are stereochemically dependent. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz, is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration. A smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* configuration. This strongly suggests the compound has a *trans* double bond.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This signal, also in the alkene region, represents one proton. It appears as a doublet of quartets (dq). This indicates it is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group of an acetate (CH₃-C=O). The singlet (s) multiplicity means there are no protons on the adjacent atom.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This signal for three protons appears as a doublet (d). This splitting pattern is typical for a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nNow, let's compare this information with the proposed structures:\n\n1.  **Cis-propenyl acetate & D) Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n    *   **Structure**: CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   **Acetate group**: Both structures have an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O), which matches the 3H singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   **Propenyl group**: They have a CH₃-CH=CH– group.\n        *   The methyl group (CH₃) at one end is attached to a vinylic carbon. It would be split by the adjacent vinylic proton, appearing as a doublet. This matches the 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm.\n        *   The vinylic proton next to the methyl group (-CH=) would be split by the other vinylic proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq), matching the signal at 5.5 ppm.\n        *   The other vinylic proton (=CH-O-) is split only by the first vinylic proton, resulting in a doublet. This corresponds to the signal at 7.0 ppm.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**: The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz for the vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm definitively points to a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. Therefore, **Trans-propenyl acetate** is the correct structure.\n\n2.  **C) Cis-butenyl acetate & B) Trans-butenyl acetate**:\n    *   **Structure**: CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   These compounds have a butenyl group, which contains an ethyl fragment (CH₃CH₂-). The ¹H NMR spectrum would need to show signals for this ethyl group (typically a triplet and a quartet). The provided data, which includes a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm and no signals for a CH₂ group, does not support the presence of a butenyl group. Therefore, these options can be ruled out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detailed analysis of the chemical shifts, integration, and particularly the coupling constants in the ¹H NMR spectrum perfectly corresponds to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The J value of 16.0 Hz is the key identifier for the *trans* stereochemistry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
