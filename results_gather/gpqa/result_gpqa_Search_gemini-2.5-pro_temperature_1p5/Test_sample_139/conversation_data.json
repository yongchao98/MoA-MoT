    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O).\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. A common gas produced in reactions with deuterated compounds is deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The information points towards a deuterated reducing agent commonly used in organic chemistry. The close analog being a very common reagent suggests either sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Consequently, substance X is likely sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) or lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). The reduction of a keto acid to a product containing two oxygen atoms is consistent with the action of these reagents.\n4.  **Confirming Substance X:** The reaction of X with a liquid Y is violent and produces a precipitate G, which upon heating releases heavy water (B). If we consider X to be LiAlD₄ and Y to be an acid like DCl, the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4DCl → LiCl + AlCl₃ + 4D₂. The gas produced is D₂ (W). Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) can form a hydrate, or in this context, a \"deuterate\" like [Al(D₂O)₆]Cl₃, which would be the precipitate G. Heating this deuterate would release heavy water, D₂O (B). This sequence of reactions aligns perfectly with all the clues. LiAlD₄ is a more potent reducing agent than NaBD₄ and is known for its violent reactions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n*   The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n*   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n*   The chemical formula is LiAlD₄. There are four atoms of the lightest element (D) and one atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n\nNow, we calculate the cumulative atomic masses:\n\n*   The atomic mass of one atom of the heaviest element, Aluminum (Al), is approximately 27 amu.\n*   The atomic mass of one atom of the lightest element's heavy isotope, Deuterium (D), is approximately 2 amu.\n*   The sum of the masses of all the heavier isotopes (one Aluminum atom) is 1 x 27 = 27 amu.\n*   The sum of the masses of all the lighter isotopes (four Deuterium atoms) is 4 x 2 = 8 amu.\n*   The cumulative atomic mass is the sum of these two values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
