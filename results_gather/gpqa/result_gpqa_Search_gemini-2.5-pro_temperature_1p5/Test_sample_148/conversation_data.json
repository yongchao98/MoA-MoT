    "### Analysis of the Observations\n\nHere is a breakdown of the experimental evidence and an evaluation of the possible explanations:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This indicates the presence of two similar but chemically non-equivalent species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, the two species must be stereoisomers.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) analysis separates the crude product into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both of these peaks correspond to compounds with the same mass, which matches the expected product. The ability to separate the two species by standard LC confirms they are not enantiomers, as enantiomers are not separable by achiral chromatography methods.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight, which would be detected by mass spectrometry. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product.\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is not a standard chemical term and is an unlikely event. If such a side reaction occurred, it would likely produce a molecule with a different mass, which contradicts the MS data.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** This is incorrect. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images that have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in either a standard (achiral) LC system or a standard (achiral solvent) NMR spectrum. To separate enantiomers, a chiral stationary phase (for LC) or a chiral shift reagent (for NMR) would be required.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** This is the most plausible explanation. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties and, as a result:\n    *   They give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. Corresponding protons in two diastereomers are in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts.\n    *   They can be separated by standard achiral chromatography techniques like LC.\n    *   They have the identical molecular formula and mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\nA common cause of diastereomer formation during chemical peptide synthesis is the racemization of an amino acid's alpha-carbon during the coupling step. This is especially a risk for certain amino acids or when using specific coupling reagents. If one chiral center in the growing peptide chain undergoes racemization, a mixture of two diastereomers will be formed in a ratio that can approach 1:1, matching all the experimental observations.\n\nAnother possibility is the presence of atropisomers, which are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation around a single bond. These are also a type of diastereomer and can be observed as separate species by NMR and LC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
