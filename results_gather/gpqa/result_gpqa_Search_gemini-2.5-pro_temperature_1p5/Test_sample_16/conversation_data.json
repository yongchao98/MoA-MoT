    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n### 1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex from its ions is represented by the following reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe stability constant (K_f), also known as the formation constant, for this reaction is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻])\nGiven K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem starts with a solution of the complex, so we need to consider its dissociation:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n### 2. Set Up the Equilibrium Calculation\n\nWe start with a stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n*   **Initial concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n\n*   **Change in concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] decreases by x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] increases by x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] increases by x\n\n*   **Equilibrium concentration:**\n    *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\nThe problem specifies an \"ideal pH,\" which implies we can use the absolute formation constant without correcting for the protonation of EDTA. This simplifies the calculation as we don't need to consider the different protonated forms of EDTA (H₄Y, H₃Y⁻, etc.).\n\n### 3. Apply the Formation Constant\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n### 4. Simplify and Solve for x\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large (5 x 10¹⁰ >> 1), the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the dissociation of the complex is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows us to make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for x²:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nNow, take the square root to find x:\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
