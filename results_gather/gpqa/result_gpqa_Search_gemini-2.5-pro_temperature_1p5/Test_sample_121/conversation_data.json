    "The chemical transformations described lead to a final product whose structure must be carefully determined to predict its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid to Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine is an alpha-halogenation reaction. This converts acetic acid (CH₃COOH) into bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2:** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification. This process forms ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3:** Treating ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) results in a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction, where the bromide is replaced by a cyanide group. This yields ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br). This is a classic reaction for forming a cyclic compound, known as the Perkin alicyclic synthesis.\n    *   The sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Since excess sodium hydride is used, a second proton is removed from the same carbon, creating another carbanion.\n    *   This anion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable five-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, **4**, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclopentanecarboxylate**.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4:**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\nThe structure consists of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a cyclopentane ring, with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1) of the ring.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group:** The ethyl group consists of a methyl group (-CH₃) and a methylene group (-CH₂-). These are in different chemical environments and will produce two distinct signals.\n*   **Cyclopentane Ring:**\n    *   The key to determining the number of signals from the ring protons is to assess the molecule's symmetry. The two substituents on C1, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), are different in terms of size and electronic properties.\n    *   This asymmetry means that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry that would make the two sides of the cyclopentane ring equivalent.\n    *   Consequently, all four methylene (-CH₂) groups of the cyclopentane ring (at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5) are in chemically non-equivalent environments.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these four unique methylene groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic. This is because the molecule is asymmetric, and replacing each proton in turn with a different group would create diastereomers. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   Therefore, each of the four non-equivalent methylene groups on the ring will contribute two distinct signals. This results in a total of 4 × 2 = 8 signals from the cyclopentane ring protons.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   Signals from the ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from the cyclopentane ring protons: 8\n\nTotal distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\n<<<A>>>"
