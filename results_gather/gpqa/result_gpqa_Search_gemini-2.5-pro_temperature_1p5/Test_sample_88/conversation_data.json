    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). While the provided spectral data (¹H NMR showing vinylic protons at 4.79 ppm and IR showing a ketone at 1720 cm⁻¹) is contradictory, the reaction conditions strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement. A well-known reaction under these conditions is the formation of **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This is a saturated ketone, consistent with the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a characteristic C=O stretch. The contradictory NMR data is likely an error in the problem description.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. The subsequent ozonolysis step requires a double bond, so the alcohol must dehydrate. Heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum isopropoxide can facilitate dehydration. Therefore, this two-step, one-pot sequence (reduction followed by dehydration) is plausible.\n*   **Reduction:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\n*   **Dehydration:** Protoadamantan-4-ol is dehydrated to form **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\nThus, Product 2 is an alkene, which can react with ozone in the next step.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamantene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by DMS workup). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond (C4=C5 in protoadamantene) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) ensures that aldehydes are formed. This reaction opens one of the rings in the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic dialdehyde: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde).\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in this molecule are the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically resonate at δ 9-10 ppm.\n*   **Symmetry:** In its preferred chair-chair conformation, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane has a plane of symmetry, making the two aldehyde groups at positions C3 and C7 chemically equivalent. We therefore only need to analyze the splitting pattern for one of them.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:**\n    *   The aldehyde proton (H_ald) will be coupled to the proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (H3). This is a three-bond coupling (³J), which will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   Aldehyde protons can also exhibit long-range coupling (typically ⁴J) through a \"W-shaped\" arrangement of bonds. In the stable conformation of product 3, the aldehyde proton has a W-pathway to the equatorial protons on the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C4).\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two equatorial protons at C2 and C4 are equivalent to each other. Therefore, the aldehyde proton couples to these two equivalent protons, which splits its signal into a **triplet**.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The combination of these couplings results in a signal that is a **doublet of triplets**. The signal is first split into a doublet by H3, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two equivalent protons on C2 and C4.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
