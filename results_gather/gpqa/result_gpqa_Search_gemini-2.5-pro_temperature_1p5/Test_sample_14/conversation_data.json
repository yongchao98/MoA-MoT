    "The final result of the calculation depends on the ratio of the transit probabilities. The geometric probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit is the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_star`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n\nThe formula is:\n`Prob_transit ≈ R_star / a`\n\nTo find the semi-major axis (`a`), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates `a` to the orbital period (`P`) and the mass of the host star (`M_star`). The law can be written as:\n`P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star`\n\nFrom this, we can express the semi-major axis as:\n`a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nBy substituting this into the transit probability formula, we can see how the probability depends on the stellar mass and the planet's orbital period:\n`Prob_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can set up a ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\nGiven information:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_2 is three times that of Planet_1 (`P_2 = 3 * P_1`).\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's host (`M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`).\n*   Both host stars have the same radius (`R_star1 = R_star2`).\n\nLet's calculate the ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2`:\n`Ratio = (R_star1 / (M_star1 * P_1^2)^(1/3)) / (R_star2 / (M_star2 * P_2^2)^(1/3))`\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n`Ratio = (R_star1 / R_star2) * [(M_star2 * P_2^2) / (M_star1 * P_1^2)]^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we substitute the given relationships:\n*   `R_star1 / R_star2 = 1`\n*   `M_star1 = 2 * M_star2`\n*   `P_2 = 3 * P_1`\n\n`Ratio = 1 * [(M_star2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_star2) * P_1^2)]^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = [(M_star2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_star2 * P_1^2)]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `M_star2` and `P_1^2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n`Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`Ratio = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives:\n`Ratio ≈ 1.65096`\n\nThis result indicates that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
