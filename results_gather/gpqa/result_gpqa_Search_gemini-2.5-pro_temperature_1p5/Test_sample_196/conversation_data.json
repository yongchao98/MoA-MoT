    "### Step 1: Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the initial reactant, Compound X, from the provided infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet appearing this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a para- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a methine (CH) group attached directly to the benzene ring.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a methylene (CH₂) group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates a methyl (CH₃) group attached to a CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl (CH₃) group attached to a CH₂ group.\n\nLet's assemble the alkyl substituent from the NMR fragments. The fragments are a -CH group, a -CH₂ group, a CH-CH₃ group, and a -CH₂-CH₃ group. The only way to combine these to form a single C₄H₉ alkyl group that fits all the splitting patterns is a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃].\n\n*   The **CH** at 2.9 ppm is attached to the ring, a methyl group, and a methylene group.\n*   The **CH₃** at 1.4 ppm is attached to the benzylic CH, creating a doublet.\n*   The **CH₂** at 1.7 ppm is adjacent to both the benzylic CH and the terminal methyl group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n*   The terminal **CH₃** at 0.9 ppm is adjacent to the CH₂ group, creating a triplet.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option (A).\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction\n\nCompound X, identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\nThis combination of reagents (red P and HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a carbon framework all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this specific case, the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The benzene ring and the sec-butyl substituent are unaffected by these reaction conditions.\n\nThe transformation is as follows:\n4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### Step 3: Identification of the Final Product\n\nComparing the resulting product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This structure is incorrect.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
