    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each signal is the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This points to three different types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H), as the protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H), as all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H), as the protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Two singlets (6H each), corresponding to the two pairs of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). The ratio would be 1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1H each), for the non-equivalent protons at C4 and C6.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1 (corresponding to 6H for the C1/C3 pair, 3H for the C2 methyl, and 3H for the C5 methyl).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Due to symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (4H), as all four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** A quartet (4H, -CH2-) and a triplet (6H, -CH3-). The presence of quartets and triplets (due to splitting) means this compound can be ruled out, as the problem states only singlets are observed in the alkyl region. This eliminates option **D**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nNow, let's consider the NMR spectra for a 1:1 mixture of the remaining pairs.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5- and two singlets (1H each) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in three signals, which contradicts the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5- and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in four distinct signals. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4- and two singlets (1H each) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in three signals, which is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Two singlets (6H each) from 1,2,3,4- and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-. This combination does not readily produce a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also provides one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, these two non-equivalent singlets would each correspond to 2 protons, resulting in the observed **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons. Combining these gives three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to the observed **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly matches both the aromatic and alkyl region data from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
