    "All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except:\n\n**A) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.**\nThis statement is correct. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to produce the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from its ORF1a and ORF1b genes, located at the 5' end of the genome. [2, 4, 29] This process is mediated by a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. [4, 7] Structural analyses have shown that the frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same or a nearly identical conformation. [4, 7]\n\n**B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex does operate as a heterodimer in a proofreading/mismatch repair mechanism, its function is not to prevent the breakdown of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). [1, 13] Instead, the complex acts as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease that actively hydrolyzes or digests dsRNA to remove mismatched nucleotides from the growing RNA strand. [1, 17] This process increases the fidelity of viral replication. The function is to break down specific RNA structures for repair, not to prevent the breakdown. [17, 19]\n\n**C) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.**\nThis statement is correct. Studies have established a linear correlation between the in vitro frameshifting rate and the conformational diversity of the RNA pseudoknot. [4, 5] Under mechanical tension, which mimics the force exerted by a translating ribosome, both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals have been shown to adopt two distinct conformations, a characteristic shared with other pseudoknots that facilitate similar rates of frameshifting. [4, 5, 22]\n\n**D) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.**\nThis statement is correct. Research has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein induces apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. [3, 12, 15] These studies also note that ORF3a does not affect the expression of Bcl-2, a crucial protein in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway. [12, 15] This evidence strongly indicates that ORF3a triggers apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway. [3, 15]\n\n<<<B>>>"
