    "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M₁/M₂). The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be found using the periods and radial velocity amplitudes of its components.\n\n### Key Formula\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is given by the formula:\n\nM * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\nwhere:\n-   `M` is the total mass of the system.\n-   `P` is the orbital period.\n-   `K₁` and `K₂` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For eclipses to occur, the orbital plane must be very close to our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. In this case, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass formula to:\n\nM ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### Calculation\nWe can now calculate the total mass for each system.\n\n**For System 1:**\n-   Period (P₁): 2 years\n-   Radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ, K₁ᵦ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n-   Sum of amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n-   Period (P₂): 1 year\n-   Radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ, K₂ᵦ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n-   Sum of amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2). The constant term (1 / (2πG)) will cancel out in the ratio.\n\nRatio = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRatio = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
