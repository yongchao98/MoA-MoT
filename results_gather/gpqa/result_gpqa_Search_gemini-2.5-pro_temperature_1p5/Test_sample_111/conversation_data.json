    "This is a quantum mechanics problem that can be solved step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the state |α>\n\nThe given state is `|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. To work with it, we first need to normalize it. The squared norm is:\n<α'|α'> = |(1+i)|² + |(2-i)|² = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√7`. Therefore, the normalized state |α> is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\n### 2. Finding the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij`, where `Aij = ħ/2` if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. In the `|up>`, `|down>` basis, the matrix is:\nA = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`, the eigenvector equation is `A|v₁> = (ħ/2)|v₁>`. This yields the normalized eigenstate `|A₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`, the eigenvector equation is `A|v₂> = (-ħ/2)|v₂>`. This yields the normalized eigenstate `|A₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λᵢ` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<Aᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2**:\n    P(λ₁) = |<A₁|α>|² = |(1/√2)*(<up| + <down|) * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]|²\n    P(λ₁) = |(1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)]|² = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2**:\n    P(λ₂) = |<A₂|α>|² = |(1/√2)*(<up| - <down|) * (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]|²\n    P(λ₂) = |(1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)]|² = |(-1+2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Average Value of A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `<A> = <α|A|α>`. It can also be calculated using the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂\n<A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are **0.64** and **0.36**, and the average value is **ħ/7**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
