    "Here is an analysis of the two rearrangement reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+)`\n\nThis reaction is a Wittig rearrangement of an ether. The starting material is benzyl prenyl ether, `Ph-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`. The process involves two key steps:\n1.  Deprotonation using a strong base, butyllithium (BuLi). The most acidic protons are on the carbon adjacent to both the phenyl ring and the ether oxygen (the benzylic position). BuLi removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion.\n2.  The resulting carbanion undergoes a rearrangement. Two major pathways are possible for Wittig rearrangements: the-Wittig rearrangement and the-Wittig rearrangement.\n\n*   **-Wittig Rearrangement:** This is a concerted, pericyclic reaction that is often favored at low temperatures. For this starting material, the-rearrangement would yield `1-phenyl-2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-ol`.\n*   **-Wittig Rearrangement:** This pathway proceeds through a stepwise mechanism involving radical intermediates. It can be competitive with or even favored over the-shift, particularly when the potential radical intermediates are well-stabilized, as is the case with the benzyl group. The-rearrangement of benzyl prenyl ether results in the entire prenyl group migrating from the oxygen to the benzylic carbon. This produces `1-phenyl-4-methylpent-3-en-1-ol` after protonation.\n\nThe options provided for product A are `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol` and `(Z)-2-methyl-5-phenylpent-2-en-1-ol`. The first option, `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol` (an equivalent name for `1-phenyl-4-methylpent-3-en-1-ol`), corresponds exactly to the product of the-Wittig rearrangement. The other proposed structure is highly unlikely as it would require extensive bond breaking and reformation rather than a standard rearrangement. Given the choices, the major product is the one formed from the-Wittig rearrangement.\n\n**Product A = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**\n\n### Reaction B: `3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat`\n\nThis reaction involves heating a complex polycyclic molecule that contains a 1,5-diene moiety (indicated by the `1,11-dimethylene` groups, which are exocyclic double bonds). The problem states that the Cope rearrangement is a relevant reaction, which is a-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene.\n\nA key characteristic of the Cope rearrangement is that it is a concerted, pericyclic isomerization. This means that the reaction rearranges the atoms within the molecule without adding or removing any atoms. Consequently, the molecular formula and the degree of unsaturation of the product must be identical to that of the starting material.\n\nThe starting material is described as a `hexahydro-` derivative. This indicates it has six more hydrogen atoms than its fully aromatic parent compound. The product options are a `tetrahydro-` derivative (four extra hydrogens) and a `hexahydro-` derivative (six extra hydrogens).\n\nSince the Cope rearrangement is an isomerization, the `hexahydro-` starting material must yield a `hexahydro-` product. The formation of a `tetrahydro-` product would require a subsequent elimination of a hydrogen molecule (H₂), which is a separate dehydrogenation or aromatization reaction. While such a step can occur at high temperatures to form a more stable aromatic system, the question specifies a Cope rearrangement, whose direct product is the isomer. Therefore, the product that retains the `hexahydro` state is the correct one.\n\n**Product B = 2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Product B is the **hexahydro** derivative.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
