    "The provided problem is a standard chemistry titration calculation. My initial step-by-step derivation of the pH values at the two specified points appears to be correct based on established chemical principles. The google search results confirm the methods used:\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation:** The initial dilution step is a simple `M1V1 = M2V2` calculation to find the new concentration of acetic acid before titration begins.\n2.  **Ka of Acetic Acid:** The problem provides Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵. Various sources give slightly different values, but they are all very close. For instance, Ka = 1.8 x 10⁻⁵ (pKa = 4.76), and Ka = 1.75 x 10⁻⁵ (pKa = 4.756). Using the value given in the problem is standard practice.\n3.  **pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region):** At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base, leaving 75% of the acid. This creates a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), is the correct formula to use. The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] will be 25/75 or 1/3. My calculation of pH ≈ 4.26 from pKa + log(1/3) is correct.\n4.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** At the equivalence point, all the weak acid has been converted into its conjugate base. The solution's pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of this conjugate base (acetate) in water, which produces OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic (pH > 7). To calculate the pH, one must first find the concentration of the conjugate base, then calculate Kb from Ka (using Kb = Kw / Ka), and then use an ICE table or a derived formula to find the [OH⁻], from which pOH and then pH can be calculated. My calculation leading to pH ≈ 8.52 follows this exact procedure.\n\nThe calculated values of 4.26 and 8.52 match one of the options perfectly. Therefore, no more searching or calculation is needed.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Dilution of Acetic Acid (HAc):**\n    *   Initial moles of HAc = 0.02000 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Total volume after adding water = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n    *   New concentration of HAc = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n3.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   At this point, 25% of the HAc has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (Ac⁻), and 75% remains as HAc.\n    *   The ratio of [Ac⁻]/[HAc] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([Ac⁻]/[HAc]).\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   Rounding gives **pH = 4.26**.\n\n4.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Moles of NaOH must equal initial moles of HAc.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of HAc has been converted to 0.001 mol of Ac⁻.\n    *   Total volume of solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [Ac⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   Acetate reacts with water (hydrolysis): Ac⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HAc + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Assuming x is small, we can approximate: x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding gives **pH = 8.52**.\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
