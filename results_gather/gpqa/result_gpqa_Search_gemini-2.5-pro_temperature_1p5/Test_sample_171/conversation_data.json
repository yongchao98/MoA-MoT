    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms across different energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The search results confirm that the Boltzmann equation is the appropriate tool for analyzing the population of energy levels in stellar atmospheres, assuming LTE.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_b` and `N_a` are the number of atoms in the higher energy state (b) and lower energy state (a), respectively.\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of these energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` (or `ΔE`) is the energy difference between the two states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe term `N_b / N_a` represents the \"excitation\" of the atoms to the higher energy level.\n\n**Applying the Equation to the Two Stars**\n\nWe are given two stars, Star 1 and Star 2, with effective temperatures T₁ and T₂, respectively. We are considering the same energy level transition for iron atoms in both stars, which means that `ΔE`, `g_b`, and `g_a` are the same for both.\n\nThe problem states that the iron atoms in Star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in Star 2. This can be expressed as the ratio of populations in Star 1 is double the ratio in Star 2:\n\n(N_b / N_a)₁ = 2 * (N_b / N_a)₂\n\nNow, we can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n*   **For Star 1:** (N_b / N_a)₁ = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n*   **For Star 2:** (N_b / N_a)₂ = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\nSubstituting the relationship between the population ratios into the first equation:\n\n2 * [(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]] = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n\nThe statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` cancels out:\n\n2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)] = exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]) = ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)])\n\nln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂) = -ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\nFactoring out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1/T₂) - (1/T₁) ]\n\nCombining the terms in the brackets:\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n**Using the Given Energy Value**\n\nThe problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nTherefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n(1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
