    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning its formula is CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as:\nMass Fraction (H) = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of compound)\n0.1428 = (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\n\nThis simplifies to m/n ≈ 2. The empirical formula is CH2.\nThe general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\nThe problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is formed by the hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y and does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon under the given conditions. A common cycloalkane solvent with the formula CnH2n is cyclohexane (C6H12).\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane (C6H12):\n*   Mass of Hydrogen = 12 × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 12 g/mol\n*   Mass of Carbon = 6 × 12.011 g/mol ≈ 72 g/mol\n*   Total Molar Mass ≈ 84 g/mol\n*   Mass fraction of H = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.28%.\n\nThis is a perfect match. Thus, **Substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. It does not decolorize bromine water. Crucially, the hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only substance Z (cyclohexane). Also, Z itself is one of the components of mixture Y.\n\nLet the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\nWhen mixture Y (Y1 + Y2) is hydrogenated, it gives only cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) naturally yields cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y2 must also yield cyclohexane.\n\nSince mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, its components are considered saturated in this context. While alkanes and cycloalkanes are saturated, aromatic compounds like benzene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that Y2 is benzene (C6H6).\n*   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n*   **Does Y decolorize bromine water?**: Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, also does not decolorize bromine water. So this condition is met.\n*   **Is Z (cyclohexane) a constituent of Y?**: Yes, it is one of the two components. This condition is met.\n*   **Does hydrogenation of Y give only Z?**:\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane (Z). This condition is met.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Thus, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Mixture X and Find the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (X1 and X2). When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form the equimolar mixture Y. This type of reaction, where an unsaturated cyclic compound converts to a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic ring, is a known process (e.g., Zelinsky irreversible catalysis).\n\nThe reaction is a hydrogen transfer: one component of X is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, while the other is dehydrogenated to benzene. Since the starting mixture X and the product mixture Y are both equimolar, we can write the overall transformation as:\n\nX1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\nX1 + X2 → Cyclohexane + Benzene\nC_aH_b + C_cH_d → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nFor the atoms to be conserved:\n*   **Carbon atoms**: The fact that both products are C6 compounds, and that hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 yields cyclohexane (a C6 compound), implies that both X1 and X2 must be C6 hydrocarbons. So, a = 6 and c = 6.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms**: The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved as no external hydrogen is added in this step.\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    b + d = 12 + 6\n    b + d = 18\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are C6H_b and C6H_d, and the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18. The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely this sum.\n\nFor completeness, plausible candidates for X1 and X2 could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene like cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   10 + 8 = 18.\n*   Both are unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n*   Both have a C6 ring structure that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   The reaction would be: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a balanced disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
