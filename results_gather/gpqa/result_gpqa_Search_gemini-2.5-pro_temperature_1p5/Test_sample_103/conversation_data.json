    "The search results confirm the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity**: The Doppler formula relates the wavelength shift (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r). Specifically, v_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀). This means the maximum radial velocity of the star (the amplitude, K) is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**: The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, for a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0), is given by an expression that relates the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), the orbital period (P), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula for K, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, simplifies to:\n    *   K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n\nNow, I'll re-apply the logic from the scratchpad with the confirmed formulas.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Star masses are equal: M_star1 = M_star2\n*   Planet masses are similar: m_p1 ≈ m_p2\n*   Orbits are circular: e₁ = e₂ = 0\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #1: Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #2: Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n*   We need to find the ratio of the periods: P₂ / P₁\n\n**Step 1: Relate wavelength shift to velocity amplitude (K).**\nSince K ∝ Δλ_max, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for K to relate it to the orbital period.**\nK = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)\n\nLet's write the ratio K₂ / K₁:\nK₂ / K₁ = [ (m_p2*sin(i₂)/M_star2^(2/3)) * (2πG/P₂)^(1/3) ] / [ (m_p1*sin(i₁)/M_star1^(2/3)) * (2πG/P₁)^(1/3) ]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the ratio using the given information.**\n*   M_star1 = M_star2, so the M_star terms cancel.\n*   m_p1 ≈ m_p2, so the m_p terms cancel.\n*   The problem does not specify the inclination `i`. The RV method measures `m_p * sin(i)`. When it says the planets have similar masses, it is reasonable to assume the measured `m_p * sin(i)` values are what is being referred to as similar, or that `sin(i)` is assumed to be the same for both. Under this standard assumption for such a problem, the `m_p * sin(i)` terms cancel.\n*   2πG is a constant and cancels out.\n\nThe simplified ratio becomes:\nK₂ / K₁ = (1/P₂)^(1/3) / (1/P₁)^(1/3)\nK₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁).**\nWe know K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides of the equation:\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nRearrange to find the required ratio, P₂ / P₁:\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744\n\nNow, calculate the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is very close to 0.36.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option C.\n\nFinal check:\n- Larger wavelength shift (Planet 2) -> Larger stellar velocity K (K₂ > K₁)\n- K is inversely related to the period (K ∝ P⁻¹/³)\n- Therefore, a larger K implies a smaller period (P₂ < P₁).\n- The ratio P₂/P₁ must be less than 1. The result ~0.36 is consistent with this.\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal calculation:\n(5/7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.36443...\n\nThe steps and conclusion are sound. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe periodic shift in a star's spectral line, as measured by the Radial Velocity (RV) method, is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (K). Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their spectral line shifts.\n\nK₂ / K₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the orbital inclination.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that the stellar masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). It is a standard assumption in such problems that the unknown inclination factors (sin i) are also comparable.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes simplifies to a relationship dependent only on the orbital periods:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = [(1/P₂)^(1/3)] / [(1/P₁)^(1/3)] = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n\n1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods (P₂ / P₁), we first cube both sides of the equation:\n\n1.4³ = P₁ / P₂\n2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\nFinally, we invert the expression to solve for P₂ / P₁:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<C>>>"
