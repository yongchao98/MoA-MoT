    "Here's a breakdown of the physics involved to determine the relationship between the two mean free paths:\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other. This value depends on the number density of the gas molecules (how many there are per unit volume) and their kinetic cross-section. The kinetic cross-section can be thought of as the effective \"size\" of a molecule as seen by another molecule, which is related to their physical diameters.\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This is the mean free path of the high-energy (1000 kV) electrons from the beam as they travel through the remaining gas molecules. This value depends on the same number density of gas molecules but a different cross-section: the *electron scattering cross-section*.\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the nature of the collision and the size of the \"target\" from the perspective of the projectile.\n\n*   A gas molecule colliding with another is a collision between two relatively large objects (on the atomic scale).\n*   An electron, however, is a point-like particle. A high-energy electron travels at a significant fraction of the speed of light and can pass through the electron cloud of a gas molecule without interaction. A \"collision\" or scattering event only occurs if the electron passes very close to the atomic nucleus or one of the inner-shell electrons.\n\nBecause of this, the effective target area that a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron (the electron scattering cross-section) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section it presents to another gas molecule.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ).\n\nSince the electron scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (σ_electron << σ_gas), the resulting mean free path for the electrons (λ2) will be much larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nTherefore, λ2 is significantly greater than λ1. Reviewing the options, only one choice correctly reflects that λ2 is larger than λ1.\n\nA) λ2 < λ1 — This is incorrect. It would imply the electron has a larger chance of hitting a gas molecule than another gas molecule does.\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 — This is the correct conclusion. It states that λ2 is larger than λ1, which is physically sound. The factor of 1.22 provides a conservative lower bound for this increase. Physics dictates λ2 will be substantially larger than λ1.\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 — This is incorrect. It suggests that while λ2 is larger, the difference is very small and constrained, which contradicts the physical understanding that the difference should be significant.\nD) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation — This is incorrect as the two phenomena (molecule-molecule vs. electron-molecule collisions) are governed by different interaction cross-sections.\n\n<<<B>>>"
