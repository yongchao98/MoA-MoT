    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n2.  A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n3.  A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three groups are in a meta-relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Bromobenzene is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. The bromo group (-Br) is an *ortho, para*-director. This step will yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, not the required 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This sequence will not lead to a 1,3,5 pattern. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts Acylation).\n*   Step ii: Acetophenone is treated with Br2/FeBr3. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This will correctly yield 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   Step iii: 3-bromoacetophenone is treated with HNO3/H2SO4. Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1 (a *meta*-director) and a bromo group (-Br) at position 3 (an *ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Because the directing effects of the two groups are in conflict, this step would produce a mixture of isomers, including the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one and, significantly, 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In fact, literature suggests that nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone yields primarily the 4-nitro product. Therefore, this route would not provide a high yield of the target molecule.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline (Reduction).\n*   Step iii: Aniline is treated with CH3COCl/AlCl3. A Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction fails on a strongly activated ring like aniline because the lone pair on the nitrogen coordinates with the Lewis acid (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating ammonium complex. Even if we assume an alternative interpretation (e.g., formation of acetanilide first), subsequent electrophilic substitutions would lead to *ortho* and *para* products (a 1,2,4-pattern), not the desired 1,3,5-pattern. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   This sequence involves:\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (Deamination)\n*   This sequence of reactions starts with benzene and, after four steps, regenerates benzene. This pathway is circular and does not lead to the product. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n**Revisiting the Options and A Better Route**\n\nA more logical and high-yield synthesis would be:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs meta).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors. Since they are meta to each other (positions 1 and 3), they both direct the incoming bromine to position 5. This reinforcement of directing effects would lead to a high yield of the specific desired isomer, though the reaction may be slow due to the presence of two deactivating groups.\n\nThis correct sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is not an option. However, option B is (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration). Given that options A, C, and D are fundamentally flawed because they lead to incorrect isomers or are nonsensical, option B is the only one that attempts to build the molecule with the correct 1,3-arrangement before adding the final group. Although the final step in option B gives a poor yield of the desired product due to conflicting directing effects, it is the \"least incorrect\" choice among the flawed options, likely assuming a misunderstanding of the competing directing effects by the question's author.\n\n<<<B>>>"
