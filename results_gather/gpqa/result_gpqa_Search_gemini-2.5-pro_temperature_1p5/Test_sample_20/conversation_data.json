    "### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomers are structural isomers that readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton (hydrogen atom), a process known as tautomerism. For keto-enol tautomerism, a key requirement is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two opposing carbonyl groups (C=O) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the double-bonded carbons (sp2-hybridized carbons). While these are technically alpha-hydrogens, their removal is difficult. If tautomerism were to occur, it would create a highly strained and unstable structure with adjacent double bonds within the ring, which is energetically unfavorable. Consequently, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups and alpha-hydrogens located on the carbons between them. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (also known as phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from achieving aromaticity is significant, so not only does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione show tautomerism, but its enol form is particularly stable.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups: a methyl group (-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, and the molecule exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two methoxycarbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon-carbon double bond, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Because it is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A), and the compound that will show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B).\n\n<<<C>>>"
