    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the transit condition:** A planet is considered to be transiting its star if its center passes in front of the stellar disk. This is geometrically defined by the transit impact parameter, `b`, being less than or equal to 1. The impact parameter is the projected distance between the planet's center and the star's center during the transit, measured in units of the star's radius. For a transit and occultation to be possible, we must have `b ≤ 1`. The maximum orbital period for the second planet that allows for a transit will occur at the largest possible semi-major axis, which corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter, `b₂ = 1`.\n\n2.  **Use the impact parameter formula:** The impact parameter is given by the formula:\n    `b = (a / Rₛ) * cos(i)`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, `Rₛ` is the stellar radius, and `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the observer's line of sight.\n\n3.  **Use the information for both planets:**\n    *   For planet 1, we are given `b₁ = 0.2`. So, `0.2 = (a₁ / Rₛ) * cos(i)`.\n    *   For planet 2, the condition for the maximum period is `b₂ = 1`. So, `1 = (a₂ / Rₛ) * cos(i)`.\n\n4.  **Establish a relationship between the semi-major axes:** Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclination `i` is the same. The star's radius `Rₛ` is also the same for both. We can therefore take a ratio of the two equations to eliminate `cos(i)` and `Rₛ`:\n    `b₂ / b₁ = [(a₂ / Rₛ) * cos(i)] / [(a₁ / Rₛ) * cos(i)]`\n    `b₂ / b₁ = a₂ / a₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:** Substitute the known values of `b₁` and `b₂`:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n    This means the semi-major axis of the second planet is 5 times larger than that of the first planet.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). This can be written as:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)`³\n\n7.  **Solve for the period of the second planet (P₂):** Rearrange the formula and substitute the known values:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)`\n    `P₂ = P₁ * (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)`\n    `P₂ = 3 days * (5)^(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    `5^(3/2) = 5 * √5 ≈ 5 * 2.236 = 11.18`\n    `P₂ = 3 * 11.18 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star are not required for this calculation, assuming the standard definition of a transit where the planet's center crosses the stellar disk.\n\n<<<A>>>"
