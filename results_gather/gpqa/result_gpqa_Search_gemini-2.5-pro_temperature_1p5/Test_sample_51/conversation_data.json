    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes, we must apply the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. Understanding the Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms, *n*, in two different energy levels, *i* and *j*, is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n*nᵢ / nⱼ = (gᵢ / gⱼ) * exp[-(Eᵢ - Eⱼ) / kT]*\n\nwhere:\n*   *gᵢ* and *gⱼ* are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   *Eᵢ* and *Eⱼ* are the energies of the levels.\n*   *k* is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   *T* is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Interpreting the Problem Statement\n\nLet the two levels be level 1 and level 2. The problem states that the ratio R = n₁/n₂ *decreases* when the star has spots. This means the ratio is lower at the cooler temperature (T_spots = 5500 K) than at the hotter temperature (T_nospots = 6000 K).\n\nR_spots < R_nospots\n\nLet's analyze how the population ratio changes with temperature. The population of higher energy levels decreases relative to lower energy levels as temperature drops. For the ratio R = n₁/n₂ to decrease with temperature, level 1 must be the higher energy level and level 2 the lower one (n₁ = n_upper, n₂ = n_lower).\n\nSo, the ratio is:\nR = n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp[-ΔE / kT]\n\nHere, ΔE = E_upper - E_lower is the energy difference between the two levels, which is always positive.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength, λ = 1448 Å. The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula E = hc/λ. A convenient version of this formula for astronomical calculations is:\n\nΔE (in eV) = 12400 / λ (in Å)\n\nΔE = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Ratios\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of R_nospots to R_spots:\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nFactor = [ (g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₁/g₂) cancel out, and by simplifying the exponentials, we get:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values:\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term ΔE/k:\nΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\nNext, let's calculate the temperature-dependent term:\n(1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, substitute these back into the factor equation:\nFactor = exp[ (-99379 K) * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ]\nFactor = exp(99379 / 66000)\nFactor = exp(1.5057)\nFactor ≈ 4.507\n\nThis calculated factor of approximately 4.5 corresponds to the provided option B. The additional information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
