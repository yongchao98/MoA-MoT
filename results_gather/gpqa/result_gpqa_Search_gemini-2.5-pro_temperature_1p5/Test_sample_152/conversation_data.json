  "question": "α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Based on a detailed analysis of the three reactions, the correct option is identified by determining the major final product of each reaction.\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate, formed by deprotonation with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the adduct.\n4.  **Product (A):** The resulting product is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`. Based on IUPAC nomenclature, this is named **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is a nucleophile at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This type of reaction is known as a Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile).\n3.  **Reaction:** The enamine adds to the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.\n4.  **Product (B):** A cyclohexanone ring is regenerated, with the alkyl group attached at the α-position (C2). The final product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where the product, one reactant (Michael acceptor), and reaction conditions are given. We must identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone).\n3.  **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n4.  **Retrosynthesis:** The bond formed is between the nucleophilic α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. The `-(CH₂CH₂COCH₃)` group in the product comes from the methyl vinyl ketone. This group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione skeleton. Therefore, the nucleophile must have been the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n5.  **Reactant (C):** The Michael donor is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The strong base (KOH) deprotonates the acidic proton at C2, which then attacks the acceptor. This is confirmed by literature describing the Michael addition of methyl vinyl ketone to cyclohexanedione derivatives to form 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione structures.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
