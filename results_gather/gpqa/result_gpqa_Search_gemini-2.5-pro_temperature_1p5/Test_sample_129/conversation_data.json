    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of an object so that its Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider two key factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based observations.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** This is the wavelength of the spectral line in the hydrogen atom's rest frame. Its value is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength (λ_obs):** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, absorbs most ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ground-based telescopes can effectively observe down to a wavelength of about 3200-3500 Å. Wavelengths shorter than this are blocked and cannot be detected from the ground. This atmospheric cutoff represents the minimum *observed* wavelength.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The cosmological redshift (z) stretches the wavelength of light. The relationship between the rest wavelength and the observed wavelength is given by the formula:\n\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n    To find the lower limit on the redshift, we set λ_obs to the minimum wavelength observable from the ground (~3500 Å) and solve for z:\n\n    z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\n    z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    z ≈ 2.88 - 1\n    z ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift of approximately 1.88 is the minimum redshift required for the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Å to be shifted into the observable window of a ground-based telescope. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 1.2\n*   B) 3\n*   C) 2.4\n*   D) 1.9\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to 1.9. Direct observations are generally restricted to redshifts z ≳ 1.7. Some sources indicate a typical redshift of z ≳ 2.5 is required for ground-based observations, but the question asks for the lower limit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
