    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations posits that the interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, free nucleon. This simplifies complex many-body problems into more manageable two-body calculations. This approximation is predicated on a set of specific assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment.\n\nThe core assumptions that collectively underpin the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational principle of the approximation. The complex interaction with the entire nucleus is reduced to a sum of interactions with its individual constituent nucleons. The probe is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time, with the other nucleons acting as mere spectators. This is sometimes referred to as the \"one-body\" assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles do not significantly interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. In other words, the probe's wave is not substantially distorted by the nuclear medium before or after the primary interaction. This is also known as the transparency or dilution assumption.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the forces binding the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible compared to the force of the interaction itself. The nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle, not influenced by the nuclear potential.\n\nThe third statement provided in the question, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" is not a standard assumption for the impulse approximation. In fact, at the high energies where the impulse approximation is often applied, a relativistic treatment of the nucleons (and by extension, their constituents) may become necessary. The impulse approximation itself is a model at the level of nucleons, not quarks.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
