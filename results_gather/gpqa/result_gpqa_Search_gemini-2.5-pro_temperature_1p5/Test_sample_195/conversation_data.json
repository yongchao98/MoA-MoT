    "The problem requires us to find the maximum speed, $v_{max}$, of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. We can solve this by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, plus its rest mass energy. The total energy E is given by:\n$E = K + U(x) + mc^2$\n\nIn special relativity, the kinetic energy (K) is given by:\n$K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, $v$ is the velocity of the particle, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe potential energy, U(x), for a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (F = -kx) is:\n$U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nThe total energy of the system is therefore:\n$E = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nThis total energy must be conserved throughout the oscillation. We consider two points in the oscillator's motion:\n\n1.  **At the maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass is momentarily at rest. At this point, its velocity $v=0$, which means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma=1$.\n    The total energy at this position is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The potential energy is zero ($U(0) = 0$), and the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this position is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNext, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ back into this equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo isolate $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n$\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nThen, we square both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, we solve for $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
