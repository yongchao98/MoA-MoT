    "Based on the provided information and chemical principles, I will identify the correct reactants for the two named reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one\n\nThis reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a diol (a vicinal diol) to form a ketone, which is characteristic of a **Pinacol rearrangement**. A specific type of this reaction that results in a change in ring size or formation of a spirocycle from a bicyclic system is known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. The starting material 'A' must be a diol that can rearrange to the spirocyclic ketone product.\n\n*   **Option A, 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**, which is a decalindiol, is a plausible precursor. The acid treatment would protonate one of the hydroxyl groups, which then leaves as a water molecule, forming a carbocation. A subsequent rearrangement of the carbon skeleton (a 1,2-alkyl shift) leads to the formation of the stable spiro[4.5]decane ring system with a ketone group. This transformation is a classic example of this type of rearrangement.\n*   Option `2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol` is an alcohol. Treating it with H₂SO₄ would typically lead to dehydration (forming an alkene), not oxidation to a ketone.\n\nTherefore, reactant A is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**. This eliminates options A and C in the multiple-choice question.\n\n### Reaction B: B + BuLi + H⁺ → 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe conditions for this reaction (an ether, a strong base like BuLi, and an acidic workup) are characteristic of the **-Wittig rearrangement**. This is a sigmatropic rearrangement that converts an allylic ether into a homoallylic alcohol. The product and the proposed ether reactant are isomers, which is consistent with a rearrangement reaction.\n\n*   **Option B, `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`**, is an allylic ether (specifically, benzyl prenyl ether). Treatment with BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to both the phenyl group and the ether oxygen. The resulting carbanion undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic shift to form the product alcohol after protonation. While detailed analysis can sometimes lead to regioisomeric products, the overall transformation of an allylic ether to an isomeric homoallylic alcohol under these conditions is the hallmark of the-Wittig rearrangement.\n*   Option `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one` is a ketone. The reaction with BuLi, a strong nucleophile and base, would primarily result in the nucleophilic addition of a butyl group to the carbonyl carbon. It would not produce the specified alcohol, which is a reduction product without the addition of a butyl group.\n\nTherefore, reactant B is **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings for both reactions:\n*   Reactant A is **2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol**.\n*   Reactant B is **(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D in the provided choices. There appears to be a transcription error in the provided options as A and C are the only options with `dimethyloctahydronaphthalene`. Let me re-examine the image provided in context. The options are:\nA) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one\nB) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene\nC) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene\nD) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one\n\nMy analysis concludes:\n- Reactant A must be `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`.\n- Reactant B must be `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\nThis matches option C perfectly.\n\nFinal check of my logic. Reaction A is a Tiffeneau-Demjanov / Pinacol rearrangement, starting from the diol. Correct. Reaction B is a-Wittig rearrangement, starting from the ether. Correct. Therefore, the combination of the diol (A) and the ether (B) is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
