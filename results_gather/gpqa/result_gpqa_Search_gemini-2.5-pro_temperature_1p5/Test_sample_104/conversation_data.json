    "My search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n*   **Exoplanet Transit Depth**: Several sources confirm that the transit depth (ΔF/F) for a planet transiting a star is given by the ratio of their areas, which simplifies to:\n    ΔF/F = (R_planet / R_star)^2\n\n*   **Starspot Rotational Modulation**: The search results discuss how the amplitude of the light curve is related to starspot properties like size (filling factor) and temperature contrast. My derivation of the amplitude based on the flux difference between the spotted and unspotted hemispheres is a standard approach for this kind of problem. The flux is proportional to T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law), and the change in brightness is due to the cooler, dimmer spots rotating into and out of view. My formula, `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)`, correctly represents the fractional flux loss caused by the spots on the visible hemisphere.\n\nThe search did not yield a direct online calculator for this specific scenario, but it validated the underlying physics and formulas. The calculation steps are robust. I will proceed with the final answer based on my calculation.\n\n1.  **Calculate the light curve amplitude due to spots:**\n    *   F_max corresponds to the unspotted hemisphere: F_max ∝ T_star⁴\n    *   F_min corresponds to the spotted hemisphere: F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)\n    *   Given: f = 0.2, T_star = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K\n    *   Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n    *   Amplitude = 0.2 * (1 - 625/1296) = 0.2 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.10355\n\n2.  **Equate the amplitude to the exoplanet transit depth:**\n    *   Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\n3.  **Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):**\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\nFinal check of all steps and logic. Everything appears to be correct and consistent with physics principles confirmed by the search.To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating, spotted star and then determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce a transit of the same amplitude.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Flux Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its unspotted hemisphere (maximum brightness) and its spotted hemisphere (minimum brightness). We can model the flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Flux ∝ T⁴).\n\n**Given:**\n*   Star's effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere (f) = 20% = 0.20\n\n**Maximum Flux (F_max):**\nThis occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power.\nF_max ∝ T_eff⁴ = 6000⁴\n\n**Minimum Flux (F_min):**\nThis occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots faces the observer. This hemisphere's surface is 20% spots and 80% normal photosphere. The total flux is the weighted average of the flux from these two components.\nF_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\nF_min ∝ (1 - 0.20) * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴\nF_min ∝ 0.80 * 6000⁴ + 0.20 * 5000⁴\n\n**Amplitude of the Signal:**\nThe amplitude of the photometric variation is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness.\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [0.80 * T_eff⁴ + 0.20 * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (0.20 * T_eff⁴ - 0.20 * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴))\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177\nAmplitude ≈ 0.1035\n\n### 2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius\n\nThe signal produced by a transiting exoplanet is called the transit depth. For an unspotted star, the transit depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots, the transit depth must equal the calculated amplitude.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius of the planet (R_pl / R_star):\nR_pl / R_star = √0.1035\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated relative radius most closely matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
