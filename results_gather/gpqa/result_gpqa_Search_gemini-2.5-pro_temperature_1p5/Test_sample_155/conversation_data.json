    "### Analysis of the Chromatograms\n\nThe chemist performs two reactions, combines the products, and analyzes the mixture using both standard and chiral High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A detailed stereochemical analysis of each reaction is necessary to predict the resulting chromatograms.\n\n#### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n2.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides. In this case, (E)-oct-4-ene will yield a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen atom. This results in the formation of a 1,2-diol (a glycol).\n    *   The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer involves an SN2-like attack by water, causing an inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. Attack at C4 produces (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at C5 produces (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both of these are the same *meso* compound.\n    *   Similarly, the hydrolysis of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields the same *meso* compound.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1**: The final product is a single, achiral compound: *meso*-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for such two-step *anti*-dihydroxylation is that a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso*-diol.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n2.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene produces a *meso*-epoxide. (Z)-oct-4-ene gives *meso*-(4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The *anti*-addition of water to the *meso*-epoxide opens the ring to form a diol.\n    *   Attack at the C4 carbon of the *meso*-epoxide results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the C5 carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2**: Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers is formed. This is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for *anti*-dihydroxylation is that a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of diols.\n\n### **The Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   *Meso*-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**:\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n    *   Thus, the chemist will observe two peaks: one for the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols, and a separate peak for the diastereomeric *meso*-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as a third distinct peak.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC**: **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the *meso* compound).\n*   **Chiral HPLC**: **3 peaks** (one for each enantiomer and one for the *meso* compound).\n\nThis corresponds to the option predicting 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
