    "The experiment describes an immune response initiated in the Peyer's patches, which are crucial secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, after oral administration of a viral protein. The key observation is the high variability found in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells isolated from these patches. This points directly to a specific process of antibody diversification.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. This process is responsible for \"fine-tuning\" antibody affinity for an antigen during an immune response. The primary outcome of SHM is a high degree of variability in the variable region genes, which perfectly matches the experimental observation. Peyer's patches are known to be sites of robust somatic hypermutation.\n\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, consisting of a cascade of proteins that helps to clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cells and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This is a genetic process that changes the constant region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, thereby altering the antibody's effector function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA). While CSR often occurs alongside somatic hypermutation in germinal centers, it does not affect the variable region, which is where the high variability was observed.\n\n*   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that initially assembles the variable region genes from V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments. Crucially, this occurs in the bone marrow during the initial development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ in response to an antigen, not during initial B cell development.\n\nBased on the evidence, the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches following antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
