    "To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Analysis**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. This temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from the star. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n`T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)`\n\nKepler's Third Law describes the relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its semi-major axis ('a'). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). This can be rewritten to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\nBy substituting the relationship from Kepler's Law into the temperature proportionality, we can find the link between equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n\n`T_eq ∝ (1 / P^(2/3))^(1/2)`\n`T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### **Calculation**\nUsing this proportionality, we can establish a ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n`(T_eq4 / T_eq2) = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\n`P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.82986`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
