    "When solving partial differential equations numerically, \"splitting methods\" are used to divide a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems. In the context of parallel computing, the goal is to have these subproblems be independent so they can be solved simultaneously on different processors.\n\nThe key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, in the specific case described, is the use of a linear partial fraction expansion of the fractional approximation to the matrix exponential. Here's why:\n\n1.  **Fractional Approximation:** The original differential equation is discretized, resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations. The solution involves computing the exponential of a matrix, which is computationally expensive. This matrix exponential is then approximated by a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials).\n2.  **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** A key mathematical technique is to break down this complex rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. This is called partial fraction decomposition.\n3.  **Enabling Parallelism:** This decomposition is what allows for parallelization. Each of the simple fractions in the sum corresponds to a smaller, independent linear system of equations. Because they are independent, each system can be assigned to a different processor and solved at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the decomposition of the fractional approximation into a sum of linear partial fractions is the crucial step that transforms a single, large sequential task into multiple smaller, parallel tasks.\n\n*   **A) Stability analysis:** While crucial for ensuring the numerical method is reliable and doesn't produce exploding errors, stability is a general requirement for the algorithm's validity, not the specific mechanism that enables parallelism.\n*   **B) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots (whether they are real or complex) is a detail within the stability analysis and the specifics of the partial fraction expansion. It is a property that is considered but is not the overarching principle of parallelization itself.\n*   **D) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This refers to a characteristic of the physical problem being modeled. Nonlocal boundary conditions typically make parallelization more difficult because they create dependencies across the domain, which works against the goal of splitting the problem into independent parts.\n\n<<<C>>>"
