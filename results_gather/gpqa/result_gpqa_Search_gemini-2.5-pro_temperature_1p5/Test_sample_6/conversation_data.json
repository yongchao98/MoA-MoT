    "The preliminary calculation of the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon yielded a result of approximately 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV. To ensure the accuracy of this finding, the key physical constants and the underlying formula will be verified.\n\n### Verification of Constants\nThe rest mass energy of an electron (m_e*c²) is a fundamental constant in this calculation. Multiple sources confirm this value to be approximately 0.511 MeV. This is equivalent to 0.511 x 10⁶ eV. The provided average energy of a CMB photon is 10⁻³ eV.\n\n### Verification of the Physical Principles\nThe process in question is photon-photon pair production (γγ → e⁺e⁻). For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the two particles being created, which is 2 * m_e*c².\n\nThe calculation for the minimum threshold energy of the high-energy photon (E_γ) requires considering the interaction angle that maximizes the energy in the center-of-momentum frame for a given E_γ. This occurs during a head-on collision. The invariant quantity, `s`, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame, is given by `s = 2 * E_γ * E_CMB * (1 - cosθ)`, where `θ` is the angle between the two photons. For a head-on collision, `θ = 180°`, and `cosθ = -1`, which maximizes the term `(1 - cosθ)` to 2.\n\nAt the energy threshold, this invariant quantity must equal the square of the rest energy of the created particles:\n`(2 * m_e*c²)² = 2 * E_γ * E_CMB * (1 - (-1))`\n`4 * (m_e*c²)² = 4 * E_γ * E_CMB`\nThis simplifies to the formula used in the initial calculation:\n`E_γ = (m_e*c²)² / E_CMB`\n\n### Final Calculation\nUsing the verified values and formula:\n*   `m_e*c² = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV`\n*   `E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV`\n\n`E_γ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)`\n`E_γ = (0.261121 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)`\n`E_γ = 0.261121 * 10¹⁵ eV`\n\nTo compare with the given options, this result is converted to giga-electron volts (GeV), where 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV:\n`E_γ = (0.261121 * 10¹⁵ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)`\n`E_γ = 0.261121 * 10⁶ GeV`\n`E_γ = 2.61121 * 10⁵ GeV`\n\nThis result aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
