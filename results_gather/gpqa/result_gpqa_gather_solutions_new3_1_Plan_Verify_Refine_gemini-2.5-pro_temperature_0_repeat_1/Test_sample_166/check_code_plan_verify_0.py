def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by recalculating the non-Gaussianity (nG)
    of the Schr√∂dinger cat state for the given parameters.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. The non-Gaussianity (nG) for a pure state measured by relative entropy simplifies to the
       von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state, nG = S(tau).
    2. The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the
       original state `rho`. For the given parameters (phi=-pi/4), the state is an "odd cat state"
       with zero mean displacement.
    3. The entropy S(tau) is calculated from the state's second moments (<n> and <a^2>) via the
       symplectic eigenvalue `nu`.
    4. The formulas used are:
       - <a^2> = alpha^2
       - <n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)
       - nu = sqrt((<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2)
       - S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)
    5. The final calculated value is compared against the provided answer.
