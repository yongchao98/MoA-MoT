    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by performing the necessary astrophysical calculations.
    
    It verifies the following steps:
    1. Calculates the cosmological redshift (z) from the given distance.
    2. Calculates the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line.
    3. Identifies the spectral line by comparing the calculated energy to known astrophysical transitions.
    4. Determines the correct phase of the interstellar medium based on the fact that it's an *absorption* line.
    5. Compares the derived correct answer with the provided answer.
