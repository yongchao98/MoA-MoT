Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Understand the core concept
The question introduces a hypothetical scenario where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist. We need to determine how this would change Maxwell's equations, which are the fundamental laws of electromagnetism in our universe where magnetic monopoles have not been observed.

### Step 2: Analyze each of Maxwell's Equations
Let's review the four equations in their standard differential form and consider the impact of a magnetic "charge" (monopole).

1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `∇ ⋅ B = 0`
    *   **Physical Meaning:** This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero. This is the precise mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles. It means magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start from or end on a point source.
    *   **Impact of Monopoles:** If a magnetic monopole existed, it would be a source (like a north pole) or a sink (like a south pole) for magnetic field lines. Therefore, the divergence of **B** would no longer be zero. The equation would have to be modified to include a magnetic charge density term (ρ_m), becoming something like `∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m`.
    *   **Conclusion:** This equation, which relates to the **divergence of the magnetic field**, must change.

2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`
    *   **Physical Meaning:** This equation states that a changing magnetic field creates a circulating (or curling) electric field (**E**).
    *   **Impact of Monopoles:** The existence of magnetic charges would introduce a new symmetry. In the standard equations, a moving electric charge (an electric current, **J**) creates a circulating magnetic field (via the Ampère-Maxwell law). By symmetry, a moving magnetic charge (a magnetic current, **J**_m) should create a circulating electric field. This requires adding a magnetic current term to Faraday's Law. The equation would become `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m`.
    *   **Conclusion:** This equation, which relates to the **circulation of the electric field**, must also change.

3.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** `∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀`
    *   **Physical Meaning:** This relates the divergence of the electric field to electric charge density (ρ).
    *   **Impact of Monopoles:** The existence of magnetic charges doesn't change anything about electric charges. This law would remain the same.

4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** `∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t)`
    *   **Physical Meaning:** This relates the circulation of the magnetic field to electric currents and changing electric fields.
    *   **Impact of Monopoles:** This law describes the sources of a circulating magnetic field, which are electric in nature. The existence of magnetic monopoles doesn't alter these sources. This law would remain the same.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options
Based on the analysis, the two equations that would change are:
*   The one related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** (Gauss's Law for Magnetism).
*   The one related to the **circulation of the electric field** (Faraday's Law of Induction).

Now, let's match this with the given options:

*   A) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. — **Incorrect.** These are the Ampère-Maxwell and Gauss's Law for Electricity, which do not change.
*   B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. — **Correct.** This perfectly matches our findings.
*   C) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. — **Incomplete.** While true that this equation changes, Faraday's Law also changes, making option B a more complete answer.
*   D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. — **Incorrect.** The curl (circulation) of the magnetic field is described by the Ampère-Maxwell law, which does not change.

The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while many contain the correct physical reasoning, several have internal contradictions, selecting a final letter that does not match their own logic. The overwhelming consensus of the *reasoning* across all candidates supports the conclusion that both Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction would be modified.
