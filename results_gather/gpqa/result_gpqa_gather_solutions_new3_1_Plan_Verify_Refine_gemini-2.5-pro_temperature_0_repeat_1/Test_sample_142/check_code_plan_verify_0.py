    # For Reaction 1, the product is a cyclohexanone (6-membered ring).
    # The proposed starting material A is a cyclopentane derivative (5-membered ring).
    # A ring expansion from a strained 5-membered ring to a more stable 6-membered ring is a highly favorable and common pathway in Pinacol rearrangements.
    # Starting with a cyclohexane derivative would lead to a 7-membered ring, which does not match the product name.
    # Thus, the choice of a cyclopentane derivative for A is mechanistically sound.
    
    # For Reaction 2, the mechanism depends on carbocation stability and migratory aptitude.
    # 1. Carbocation formation: The carbocation at C2 is tertiary and benzylic, making it far more stable than the secondary carbocation at C3. The reaction proceeds via the C2 carbocation.
    # 2. Migration: A group from the adjacent C3 must migrate. The groups are H and CH3. Hydride (H) has a much higher migratory aptitude than methyl (CH3).
    # 3. Product: A 1,2-hydride shift occurs, leading to a ketone at C3. The resulting product is correctly named methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.
    # The structure for B in option C is the logical outcome of the reaction.

    # Both stoichiometry and mechanistic logic support option C.
