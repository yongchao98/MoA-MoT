    Checks the correctness of the answer to the electrostatics problem.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. Electrostatic Shielding: The electric field outside the conductor is independent
       of the position of the charge inside the cavity. Therefore, the formula for E
       cannot depend on variables describing the internal geometry like 'l', 's', or 'theta'.
    2. Gauss's Law / Shell Theorem: For a spherical conductor, the charge +q on the
       outer surface distributes uniformly. The external field is then equivalent to
       that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. The field magnitude
       should be proportional to q / L^2.
