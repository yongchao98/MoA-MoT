Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**

The question asks to identify two compounds:
*   **(A)** The one that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.
*   **(B)** The one that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate & dimethyl fumarate.

### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**

**Key Concept:** Keto-enol tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A crucial requirement for this process is the presence of an "alpha-hydrogen" – a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.

1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**
    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).
    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. They are sp² hybridized.
    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon. Therefore, it **cannot** undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.

2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**
    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups. The carbons between the carbonyls are CH₂ groups.
    *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. They are sp³ hybridized.
    *   **Conclusion:** This compound has multiple acidic alpha-hydrogens. It readily undergoes tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is exceptionally stable due to its aromaticity. Therefore, it **does** show tautomerism.

**Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**

**Key Concept:** Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is a "chiral center," which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.

1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**
    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
    *   **Chiral Center Analysis:** The second carbon atom (the one with the -OH group) is bonded to four distinct groups:
        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)
        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)
        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)
        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)
    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.

2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**
    *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer).
    *   **Chiral Center Analysis:** The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.
    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it **will not** show optical isomerism.

**Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### **Final Conclusion**

*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.
*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

Combining these results gives: **A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

Matching this with the provided options:
A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate
C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

The correct option is A.

Many of the candidate answers reached the correct chemical conclusion but selected the wrong letter, likely due to working with a different set of options. However, the chemical reasoning is overwhelmingly consistent.
