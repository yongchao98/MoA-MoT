    This function checks the correctness of the calculated area for the given metric.
    It uses symbolic integration to evaluate the area integral.

    The metric is ds^2 = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)) * (dx^2 + dy^2).
    The area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy.
    g_xx = g_yy = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)
    det(g) = (32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2))^2
    sqrt(det(g)) = 32 / (4 - x^2 - y^2)
    
    The area A is the integral of dA over the disk x^2 + y^2 < 4.
    In polar coordinates (rho, theta):
    x^2 + y^2 = rho^2
    dx dy = rho d(rho) d(theta)
