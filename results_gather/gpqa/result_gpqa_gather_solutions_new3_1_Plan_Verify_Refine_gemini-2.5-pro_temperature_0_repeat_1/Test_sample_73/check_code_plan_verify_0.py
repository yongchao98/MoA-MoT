    # --- Problem Definition & Given Parameters ---
    # Given: Decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%.
    # Question: After 50 minutes of survival, what is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes?
    p_decay_100_min = 0.32
    t1 = 100.0  # minutes
    t2 = 150.0  # minutes

    # --- LLM's Final Answer to be Checked ---
    # The final synthesized answer is 'B', corresponding to 44%.
    llm_answer_letter = 'B'
    options = {'A': 0.40, 'B': 0.44, 'C': 0.48, 'D': 0.52}

    # --- Verification Steps ---

    # Step 1: The core principle is the "memoryless" property of exponential decay.
    # This means the 50 minutes of prior survival are irrelevant. The problem is to find
    # the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.

    # Step 2: Calculate the survival probability for the known interval (t1=100 min).
    # The probability of survival S(t) is 1 minus the probability of decay P(t).
    # S(100) = 1 - P(100)
    s_100 = 1 - p_decay_100_min

    # Step 3: Use the survival probability S(100) to find the survival probability for t2=150 min.
    # The survival function is S(t) = e^(-位t).
    # Therefore, S(150) = e^(-位*150) = e^(-位*100 * 1.5) = (e^(-位*100))^1.5 = S(100)^1.5

        s_150 = s_100 ** (t2 / t1)
    except ValueError:
        return "Calculation Error: Could not compute the exponentiation. The base might be negative."

    # Step 4: Calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes.
    # P(150) = 1 - S(150)
    calculated_decay_prob = 1 - s_150

    # Step 5: Find which of the multiple-choice options is closest to the calculated result.
    closest_option_letter = min(
        options.keys(),
        key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - calculated_decay_prob)
    )

    # Step 6: Compare the LLM's chosen answer with the correct closest option.
