def check_stellar_temperature_equation():
    """
    Symbolically verifies the derivation for the stellar temperature problem.

    The function follows these steps:
    1.  Defines symbolic variables for temperatures (T1, T2), energy difference (dE),
        and the Boltzmann constant (k).
    2.  Sets up the initial physical relationship based on the problem statement:
        The excitation ratio in star 1 is twice that in star 2.
        R1 = 2 * R2  =>  exp(-dE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-dE/(k*T2))
    3.  Symbolically solves this equation for ln(2).
    4.  Applies the key constraint from the problem: dE/k is approximately 1.
    5.  Compares the resulting symbolic expression for ln(2) with the expressions
        given in the multiple-choice options.
    6.  Checks if the derived correct option matches the provided answer.
