    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.

    ### Step 1: Identify the Starting Material
    First, we must deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO from the provided ¹H-NMR data.

    *   **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**
        *   C₈H₉NO
        *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5.
        *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.

    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**
        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting means it's coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), indicating a -CH₂-CHO fragment.
        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is for a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.
        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.
        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The amine is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.

    *   **Structure Assembly:**
        Combining the fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH₂), and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO)—gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.

    ### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence
    Now, we trace this starting material through the three reaction steps.

    1.  **1. NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a **diazotization** reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.
    2.  **2. H₂O:** This step is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.
    3.  **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.
        *   The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).
        *   The strong base (KOH) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate.
        *   This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule, forming a β-hydroxy aldehyde (the aldol addition product).
        *   The crucial condition is **Heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. This is highly favorable as it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

    ### Step 3: Identify the Final Product Structure
    Let's determine the structure of the aldol addition product and the final condensation product.

    *   **Aldol Addition Product:** The initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This structure corresponds to **Option D**.
    *   **Final Condensation Product:** Due to heating, the addition product dehydrates by losing the -OH group from C3 and a proton from the α-carbon (C2). This forms a double bond between C2 and C3. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure corresponds to **Option A**.

    Since the reaction conditions include heat, the reaction will proceed to the final, more stable, dehydrated condensation product.

    ### Conclusion
    The final product of the entire reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches the description in Option A.
