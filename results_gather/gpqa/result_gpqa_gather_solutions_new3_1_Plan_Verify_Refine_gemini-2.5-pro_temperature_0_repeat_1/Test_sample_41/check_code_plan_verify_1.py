    # Step 1: Relate equilibrium temperature (T) to orbital distance (a).
    # The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
    # Therefore, the orbital distance 'a' is proportional to 1/T_eq^2.
    # This means the ratio of orbital distances a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)^2.
    
    # Calculate the ratio of orbital distances for Planet 2 to Planet 1

    # a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)
    a3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1
    
    # Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law to relate orbital distance (a) to orbital period (P).
    # Kepler's Third Law states P^2 is proportional to a^3.
    # Therefore, P is proportional to a^(3/2).
    # The ratio of orbital periods P_j/P_i = (a_j/a_i)^(3/2).
