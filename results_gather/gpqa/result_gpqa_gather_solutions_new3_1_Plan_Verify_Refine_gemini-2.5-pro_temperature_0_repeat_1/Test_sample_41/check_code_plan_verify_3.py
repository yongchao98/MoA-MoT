    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the exoplanet orbital period question.
    
    The problem can be solved by combining two physical principles:
    1. The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its orbital distance (a).
    2. Kepler's Third Law, which relates orbital distance (a) to orbital period (P).

    Let's break it down:
    - For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
      This means a is proportional to 1/T_eq^2.
      So, a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2.
    - Kepler's Third Law states that P^2 is proportional to a^3.
      This means P is proportional to a^(3/2).
      So, P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).

    We can combine these to find the final ratio P3 / P1.
