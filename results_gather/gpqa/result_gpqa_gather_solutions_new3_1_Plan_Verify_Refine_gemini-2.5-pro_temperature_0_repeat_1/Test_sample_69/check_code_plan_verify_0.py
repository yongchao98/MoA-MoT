    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the chemical puzzle.

    The final answer's reasoning identifies the following compounds:
    A = S₈ (Sulfur)
    B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)
    C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)
    D = CO (Carbon monoxide)
    E = CSCl₂ (Thiophosgene)
    F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)
    G = H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)
    H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)

    The final answer concludes the symmetry of E is C2v, which corresponds to option D.
    This code will verify if this set of identities satisfies all puzzle constraints.
