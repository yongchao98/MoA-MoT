    # --- Step-by-step verification based on established organic chemistry principles ---

    # Step 1: Initial reaction is the electrophilic addition of H+ to the alkene.
    # According to Markovnikov's rule, a secondary carbocation is formed.
    # Reactant: Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-CH=CH2
    # Intermediate I (secondary carbocation): Ph-O-CH2-C(Me)2-C+H-CH3

    # Step 2: Pathway A - Direct intramolecular cyclization from Intermediate I.
    # The ortho-position of the benzene ring attacks the secondary carbocation.
    # This forms a 6-membered ring (a chromane).
    # The resulting product is 3,3,4-trimethylchromane.
    product_from_pathway_A = "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"

    # Step 3: Pathway B - Rearrangement followed by cyclization.
    # Intermediate I undergoes a 1,2-methyl shift to form a more stable tertiary carbocation.
    # Intermediate II (tertiary carbocation): Ph-O-CH2-C+(Me)-CH(CH3)2
    # The ortho-position of the benzene ring attacks this tertiary carbocation.
    # This forms a 5-membered ring (a dihydrobenzofuran).
    # The resulting product is 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.
