    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Reactant: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene
    # Reaction: Cope rearrangement (specifically, a 3-aza-Cope rearrangement)
    # Question: Identify the final product.

    # Options as provided in the problem description:

    # 1. Identify the reaction pathway: The reaction is not a simple Cope rearrangement.
    #    It is a well-documented tandem reaction sequence known as the aza-Cope-Mannich cascade.
    #
    # 2. Identify the known product: According to established organic chemistry literature
    #    (e.g., "Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis" by Kurti and Czako),
    #    the reactant undergoes this cascade to form a specific, thermodynamically stable product.
    #
