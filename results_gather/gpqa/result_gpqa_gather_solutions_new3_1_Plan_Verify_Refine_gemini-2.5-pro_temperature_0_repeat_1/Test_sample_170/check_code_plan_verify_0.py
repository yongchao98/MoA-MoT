def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the proposed order of substances
    based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.

    The check is based on established principles of organic chemistry:
    1.  **Directing Effects**: Meta-directors produce a very low yield of the para-isomer,
        while ortho,para-directors produce a high yield. Therefore, any meta-director
        must come before any ortho,para-director in the sequence.
    2.  **Ordering Meta-Directors**: The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional
        to the deactivating strength of the group. The stronger the deactivator, the
        lower the para-yield. The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.
    3.  **Ordering Ortho,Para-Directors**: The para/ortho ratio is determined by steric
        and electronic effects.
        -   **Steric Hindrance**: A bulkier group (-C2H5) hinders the ortho positions more
            than a smaller group (-CH3), leading to a higher para-yield.
        -   **Halogen Selectivity**: The -Cl group is highly para-selective due to a
            combination of its inductive effect and size, yielding more para-isomer
            than simple alkylbenzenes.
