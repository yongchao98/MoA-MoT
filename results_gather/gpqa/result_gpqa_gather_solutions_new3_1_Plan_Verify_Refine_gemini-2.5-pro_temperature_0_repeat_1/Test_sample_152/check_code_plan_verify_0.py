    # --- Verification for Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)
    # 1. Michael Donor: The enolate of dimethyl malonate, [-CH(COOCH3)2], is formed by the base NaOEt.
    # 2. Michael Acceptor: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.
    # 3. Mechanism: The malonate enolate attacks the beta-carbon of the acrylate (the one bonded to the p-tolyl group).
    # 4. Product Structure: The resulting structure is (CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3.
    # 5. Naming: This structure corresponds to a propane backbone with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl group at position 2.
    #    The correct IUPAC name is 'trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate'.

    # --- Verification for Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)
    # 1. This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variant of the Michael addition.
    # 2. Michael Donor: The enamine of cyclohexanone is nucleophilic at the alpha-carbon.
    # 3. Michael Acceptor: (E)-but-2-enenitrile.
    # 4. Mechanism: The enamine attacks the beta-carbon of the nitrile. The subsequent acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.
    # 5. Product: The major final product is the thermodynamically stable keto tautomer, not the enol. The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH3)CH2CN group at the alpha-position.
    #    The correct IUPAC name is '3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile'.

    # --- Verification for Reaction C ---
    # Reaction: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
    # 1. This is a retrosynthesis problem to find the Michael donor (C).
    # 2. Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
    # 3. Michael Acceptor: but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone), which becomes the '3-oxobutyl' group.
    # 4. Donor (C): The '3-oxobutyl' group is attached to the C2 position of the dione ring. This C2 position is an active methylene group, which is deprotonated by the base (KOH) to form the nucleophile.
    #    Therefore, the starting reactant C must be 'cyclohexane-1,3-dione'.
