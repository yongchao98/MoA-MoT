Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points and evaluating the provided candidate answers.

### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions

The core of the problem is to determine the stereochemical outcome of two reactions. The reagent sequence, 1) mCPBA followed by 2) aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.

*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene)**
    *   The starting material is a *trans*-alkene.
    *   The overall transformation is an *anti*-addition.
    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**.
    *   **Product:** A single, achiral compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.

*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene)**
    *   The starting material is a *cis*-alkene.
    *   The overall transformation is an *anti*-addition.
    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.
    *   **Products:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture

The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)
2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)
3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)

The relationships between these isomers are crucial:
*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).
*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.

### Step 3: Predict the Chromatographic Results

*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**
    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity, size).
    *   **Enantiomers** (compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.
    *   **Diastereomers** (compound 1 vs. the pair 2/3) have different physical properties. Therefore, they **can** be separated.
    *   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.

*   **Chiral HPLC:**
    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.
    *   It will separate the enantiomers (compounds 2 and 3) into **two separate peaks**.
    *   It will also separate the meso compound (compound 1) from the other two, as it is a diastereomer. This will be a **third peak**.
    *   **Conclusion:** The chromatogram will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.

### Summary and Final Decision

*   Standard HPLC: **2 peaks**
*   Chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**

This outcome matches option C.

### Careful Points and Analysis of Candidate Errors

1.  **Stereochemistry:** The most critical point is correctly applying the stereochemical rules for addition reactions. Several candidate answers (e.g., Answer 1, Answer 2) incorrectly state the products of the reactions, even if they sometimes stumble upon the correct final mixture composition. The correct rule is that *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene gives a meso product, while *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene gives a racemic product.
2.  **Chromatography Principles:** One must understand that achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral HPLC separates both. All candidate answers that provide detailed reasoning seem to understand this principle correctly.
3.  **Consistency:** A major issue across the candidate answers is a disconnect between the reasoning and the final letter choice. For example, Answers 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, and 15 all provide correct reasoning that leads to "2 peaks and 3 peaks," but then select an incorrect letter (A, D, B, etc.). This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final step. Only Answers 4 and 10 show both correct reasoning and a consistent final answer.

Based on a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of the chemistry and chromatography, the correct answer is unequivocally 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.
