    This function checks the correctness of the proposed answer by modeling the
    biological principles described in the question.

    Principles Modeled:
    1.  **Promoter Activity:** The red fluorescent protein (mRaspberry) is under a
        'lineage-specific promoter'. This promoter is inactive in undifferentiated
        pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and only activates after differentiation begins.
    2.  **Timing of Differentiation:** The first observation is at 12 hours. Cell
        differentiation and subsequent protein accumulation is a process that takes
        time, making a strong, observable red signal at 12 hours highly unlikely.
    3.  **Apoptosis (Green Signal):** The TUNEL assay detects apoptosis. Apoptosis is a
        normal part of embryogenesis and a common fate for injected cells that fail
        to integrate. Therefore, a green signal is expected from the start.
