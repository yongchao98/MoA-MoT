    Checks the calculation of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

    The function recalculates the value based on the problem description and compares
    it to the provided answer. It follows the steps outlined in the correct solutions:
    1. Define constants and given data.
    2. Calculate the summation term S = Σ (2l + 1) * sin²(δ_l).
    3. Calculate the wave number k using the non-relativistic approximation, as this
       is the only way to match one of the options.
    4. Compute the final result Im[f(0)] = S / k.
    5. Compare the result with the given answer (Option A).
