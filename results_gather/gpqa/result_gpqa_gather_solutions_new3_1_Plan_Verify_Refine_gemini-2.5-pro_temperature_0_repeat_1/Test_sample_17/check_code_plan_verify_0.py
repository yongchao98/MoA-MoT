    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the astrophysics problem.
    It recalculates the ratio of silicon atoms based on the given abundance data.

    # --- Step 1: Define the given abundance values from the question ---
    # For Star 1
    Si_Fe_1 = 0.3  # [Si/Fe]_1
    Fe_H_1 = 0.0   # [Fe/H]_1

    # For Star 2
    Mg_Si_2 = 0.3  # [Mg/Si]_2
    Mg_H_2 = 0.0   # [Mg/H]_2

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio [Si/H] for each star ---
    # The abundance notation has the property: [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]

    # For Star 1: [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # For Star 2: [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging gives: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the final ratio ---
    # The question asks for the ratio R = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2.
    # In logarithmic form, log10(R) = log10((nSi/nH)_1) - log10((nSi/nH)_2).
    # From the definition [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun, we can show that:
    # log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
    log10_of_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the final numerical ratio ---
    calculated_ratio = 10**log10_of_ratio

    # --- Step 5: Compare the calculated result with the given options ---
    options = {
        "A": 0.8,
        "B": 12.6,
        "C": 3.9,

    }
    
    # Find the option closest to the calculated ratio
    closest_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - calculated_ratio))

    # The LLM's final answer is 'C'
    llm_answer = 'C'

    # --- Step 6: Check correctness ---
    # Check if the calculation is correct and if the correct option was chosen.
    # The expected value is ~3.981, which corresponds to option C.
