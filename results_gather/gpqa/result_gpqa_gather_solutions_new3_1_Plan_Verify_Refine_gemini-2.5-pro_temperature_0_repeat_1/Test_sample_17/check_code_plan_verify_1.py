    # The notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun has a useful property:
    # [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]

    # Step 1: Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 1, [Si/H]_1
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    si_h_1 = si_fe_1 + fe_h_1

    # Step 2: Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 2, [Si/H]_2
    # From the property: [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2
    # Rearranging gives: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    si_h_2 = mg_h_2 - mg_si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the ratio of silicon abundance fractions
    # The question asks for Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2
    # Taking the logarithm: log10(Ratio) = log10((nSi/nH)_1) - log10((nSi/nH)_2)
    # From the definition of [X/Y], this difference is equal to [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
    log10_ratio = si_h_1 - si_h_2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final ratio
    calculated_ratio = 10**log10_ratio
