    # Planet 1
    m_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses
    delta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms

    # Planet 2
    m_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses
    delta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms

    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) for two planets
    # orbiting the same star with the same albedo is:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)
    # where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes.

    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a circular orbit is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a).
    # K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)
    # Rearranging for 'a': a ∝ (M_p / K)^2

    # The ratio of semi-major axes is therefore:
    # a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2

    # Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)

    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ.
    # So, K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2.
    # The final formula is:
    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)

    # --- Calculation ---
    calculated_ratio = (m_p2 / m_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)

    # --- Verification ---
    # The provided answer is A, which corresponds to ~0.53
