    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    The function performs the following checks:
    1.  Symbolically derives the expression for v_max from the principle of conservation of energy.
    2.  Compares the derived expression with the provided options (A, B, C, D).
    3.  Verifies that the proposed correct answer (Option C) matches the derivation.
    4.  Checks if the relativistic formula (Option C) correctly reduces to the classical formula (Option D) in the non-relativistic limit (c -> infinity).
    5.  Checks if the formula for v_max is physically plausible (i.e., v_max < c and is a real number).
