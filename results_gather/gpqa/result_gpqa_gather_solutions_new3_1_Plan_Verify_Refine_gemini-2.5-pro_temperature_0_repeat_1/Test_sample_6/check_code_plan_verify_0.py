    # The threshold energy (E_gamma) for pair production from a head-on collision
    # of two photons (E_gamma and E_CMB) is derived from the invariance of the
    # four-momentum squared: s = (p1 + p2)^2.
    # At threshold, in the center-of-mass frame, s = (2 * m_e * c^2)^2.
    # In the lab frame, for a head-on collision, s = 4 * E_gamma * E_CMB.
    # Equating them gives: 4 * E_gamma * E_CMB = 4 * (m_e * c^2)^2
    # The correct formula is: E_gamma = (m_e * c^2)^2 / E_CMB
    # The provided answer uses this correct formula.
