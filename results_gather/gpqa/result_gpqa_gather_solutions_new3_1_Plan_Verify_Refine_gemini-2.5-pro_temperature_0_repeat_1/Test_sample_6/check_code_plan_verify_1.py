    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # The question asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (E_gamma)
    # annihilating with a CMB photon (E_CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair.
    # Reaction: gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-

    # The options as provided in the question prompt.
    options = {
        "A": 3.9e5,  # in GeV
        "B": 2.6e5,  # in GeV

        "D": 1.8e5,  # in GeV

    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # 1. Define constants and given values.
    # Rest mass energy of an electron (m_e * c^2) is a standard physical constant.
    m_e_c2_in_MeV = 0.511
    # Average energy of a CMB photon, as given in the question.
    E_CMB_in_eV = 1e-3

    # 2. Convert units for consistency. We'll use electron-volts (eV).
    # 1 MeV = 1,000,000 eV
    m_e_c2_in_eV = m_e_c2_in_MeV * 1e6

    # 3. Apply the correct physical formula.
    # The threshold energy for a head-on collision is E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_CMB.
    # This formula gives the minimum energy required for the reaction.
