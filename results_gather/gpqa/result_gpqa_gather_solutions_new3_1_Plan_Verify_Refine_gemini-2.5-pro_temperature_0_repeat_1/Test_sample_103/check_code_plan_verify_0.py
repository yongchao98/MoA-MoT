    # --- Step-by-step derivation ---
    
    # 1. The star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the 
    #    observed wavelength shift (Δλ).
    #    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is K₁/K₂ = Δλ₁/Δλ₂.
    
    # 2. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for a circular orbit is:
    #    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]
    #    where P is the orbital period, m_p is planet mass, M_star is star mass, and i is inclination.

    # 3. The problem states that star masses are the same (M_star₁ = M_star₂), and planet masses
    #    are similar (m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂). For a solvable problem, we must also assume similar
    #    inclinations (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)).
    #    Under these conditions, all terms in the formula for K are constant between the two systems
    #    except for the period P. This gives the proportionality: K ∝ P^(-1/3).

    # 4. We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:
    #    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)

    # 5. Combining the relationships from steps 1 and 4:
    #    Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)

    # 6. The question asks for the ratio P₂ / P₁. We solve for it by cubing both sides:
    #    P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3
