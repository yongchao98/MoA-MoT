def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the exoplanet orbital period problem.

    The function verifies the physical derivation and calculation:
    1.  The radial velocity amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ).
    2.  For the given constraints (equal star/planet masses, circular orbits), K is proportional to P^(-1/3), where P is the orbital period.
    3.  This leads to the relationship: P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)³.
    4.  The code calculates this value and compares it to the value of the chosen option.
