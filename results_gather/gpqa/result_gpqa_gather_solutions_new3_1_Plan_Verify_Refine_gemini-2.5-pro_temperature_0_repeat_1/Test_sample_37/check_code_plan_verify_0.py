    # --- Constraint 1: Determine the Correct Product (B) ---
    # The reaction is an alpha-alkylation of a ketone.
    # Starting ketone (from iminium salt name): pentan-2-one (CH3-CO-CH2CH2CH3)
    # Base: LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a bulky base, which favors deprotonation
    # at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon (the C1 methyl group). This is kinetic control.
    # Alkylating agent: CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) adds an ethyl group.
    # Mechanism: Alkylation at C1 of pentan-2-one with an ethyl group.
    # Original C1 (CH3-) becomes a propyl group (CH3CH2-CH2-).
    # Resulting structure: CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3
    # IUPAC Name: The longest carbon chain with the carbonyl is 7 carbons long.
    # Numbering from either end places the carbonyl at position 4.
    correct_product = "heptan-4-one"

    # --- Constraint 2: Determine the Correct Reagent Sequence (A) ---
    # A valid sequence for this type of reaction must be stepwise.
    # Step 1: Formation of the nucleophile (enamine) using a strong base (LDA).
    # Step 2: Alkylation with an electrophile (CH3CH2I).
    # Step 3: Hydrolysis with acid (H3O+) to get the final ketone.
    # A critical error is mixing the strong base (LDA) and the acid (H3O+) in the same step,
    # as they would neutralize each other, preventing the reaction.
    # A correct sequence is formatted as (i), (ii), (iii).
    # An incorrect sequence mixes reagents, e.g., in a single step (ii).
