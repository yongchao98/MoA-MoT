    This function verifies the correctness of the provided answer by recalculating the result from the problem's premises.

    The problem asks to compare the transit probabilities of two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2.

    1.  **Transit Probability Formula**: The geometric probability of a transit (`p_tr`) for a circular orbit is approximately the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).
        `p_tr ≈ R_s / a`

    2.  **Ratio of Probabilities**: We need to find the ratio `p_tr1 / p_tr2`.
        `p_tr1 / p_tr2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`
        Given that the stellar radii are equal (`R_s1 = R_s2`), this simplifies to:
        `p_tr1 / p_tr2 = a_2 / a_1`

    3.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law relates the orbital period (`P`), semi-major axis (`a`), and stellar mass (`M_s`): `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`.
        Rearranging for `a` gives: `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.

    4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**: We can now express the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:
        `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`

    5.  **Substituting Given Information**:
        - Mass relationship: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`
        - Period relationship: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`
        Substituting these into the ratio:
        `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`
        `a_2 / a_1 = [ (9 * M_s2 * P_1²) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`
        The `M_s2` and `P_1²` terms cancel out, leaving:
        `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`

    6.  **Final Calculation**: The ratio of probabilities `p_tr1 / p_tr2` is equal to `(4.5)^(1/3)`.
