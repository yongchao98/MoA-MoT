    # --- Step 1: Analyze the reactants and reaction type ---
    # Reactant: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol -> This is an enol.
    # Reagent: Bromine (Br2) -> This is a halogen.
    # The reaction of an enol with a halogen is a classic alpha-halogenation.
    # The driving force is the formation of the thermodynamically stable carbonyl (C=O) group.
    # This is the major pathway, as opposed to simple electrophilic addition to the double bond.

    # --- Step 2: Predict the product based on the major pathway (alpha-halogenation) ---
    # 1. The starting enol is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol.
    #    - The double bond is between C1 and C2.
    #    - The hydroxyl group (-OH) is on C1.
    # 2. The reaction mechanism involves the enol's double bond attacking the bromine.
    #    - The bromine atom adds to the alpha-carbon (the carbon of the double bond NOT bearing the -OH group), which is C2.
    # 3. The enol tautomerizes to the more stable keto form.
    #    - The C1-OH group becomes a C1=O (carbonyl) group.
    # 4. The substituents (4,4-dimethyl) are spectators and remain in place.
    # 5. Combining these pieces, the product is a cyclopentanone with a bromine at C2 and two methyl groups at C4.
