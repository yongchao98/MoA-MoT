    Checks the correctness of the proposed answer by verifying its self-consistency.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved.
    2. Calculate the moles of H+ required to react stoichiometrically with Fe(OH)3.
       Reaction: Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)
    3. For the given pH in the proposed answer, calculate the moles of H+ that must remain
       in the final 100 cm³ solution to achieve this pH.
    4. Sum the moles from steps 2 and 3 to get the total moles of H+ that must be added.
    5. Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid required to provide this total number of moles.
    6. Compare this calculated volume with the volume given in the proposed answer.
       If they match (within a small tolerance), the answer is correct.
