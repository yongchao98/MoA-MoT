    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

    **Step 1: Understand the Chemical Reaction**
    The core of the problem is to understand the reaction: `Compound + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) → Diketone`.
    The reagents sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) react in situ to form nitrous acid (HONO). This set of reagents is used for a specific reaction known as the α-oxidation of ketones. The reaction converts a methylene group (`-CH₂-`) located at the alpha position (adjacent) to a carbonyl group (`C=O`) into a new carbonyl group. This process forms a 1,2-diketone.

    *   **Careful Point 1:** The starting material for this specific transformation must be a ketone. Other functional groups like alcohols or diols do not react in this manner with these reagents to form diketones. This allows us to immediately evaluate the options based on the type of compound.

    **Step 2: Analyze the Options Based on the Reaction Type**
    Let's examine the proposed starting materials in each option:
    *   A) A = ketone, B = diol. (B is an incorrect substrate type).
    *   B) A = alcohol, B = diol. (Both are incorrect substrate types).
    *   C) A = ketone, B = ketone. (Both are plausible substrate types).
    *   D) A = alcohol, B = ketone. (A is an incorrect substrate type).

    Based on this initial analysis, only option C proposes the correct type of starting materials (ketones) for both reactions.

    **Step 3: Verify the Transformation for the Plausible Option (C)**
    Now, we must confirm that the specific ketones in option C would indeed yield the specified products.

    *   **Reaction A:** `A + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione`
        *   Proposed starting material A from option C is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.
        *   This molecule has a carbonyl group at position 1. The adjacent (alpha) carbon at position 2 is a methylene group (`-CH₂-`).
        *   The α-oxidation reaction will convert this methylene group into a carbonyl group.
        *   This correctly yields the product, **4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**.
        *   **Careful Point 2:** The starting material is correctly identified.

    *   **Reaction B:** `B + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione`
        *   Proposed starting material B from option C is **5-methylhexan-2-one**.
        *   The structure is `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.
        *   This molecule has a carbonyl group at position 2. The adjacent (alpha) carbon at position 3 is a methylene group (`-CH₂-`). (The other alpha carbon at position 1 is a methyl group, `-CH₃-`).
        *   The reaction preferentially occurs at the more substituted alpha-carbon that has hydrogens, which is the methylene group at C3.
        *   Oxidizing the C3 position converts the `-CH₂-` into a `C=O`, correctly yielding the product, **5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**.
        *   **Careful Point 3:** This starting material is also correctly identified.

    **Step 4: Final Conclusion**
    Both starting materials in option C are the correct type of compound (ketones) and their specific structures lead directly to the given products via the known reaction mechanism. The other options contain incorrect starting material types (alcohols/diols).

    *   **Careful Point 4:** Many of the provided candidate answers correctly identified the chemical principles but failed to match their conclusion to the correct letter option. A careful mapping of the deduced compounds (A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one) to the given options is essential. This pair corresponds exactly to option C.
