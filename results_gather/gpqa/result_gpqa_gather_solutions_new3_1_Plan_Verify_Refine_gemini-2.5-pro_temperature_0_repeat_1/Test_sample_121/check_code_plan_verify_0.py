    # 1a. Chirality: The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, C2-path, C6-path).
    # Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule has no plane of symmetry.

    ethyl_ch2_signals = 2
    correct_ethyl_signals = ethyl_ch3_signals + ethyl_ch2_signals  # Correct count is 3

    # Because the molecule is chiral (no symmetry), all 5 methylene (CH2) groups are chemically distinct.
    num_distinct_ring_ch2_groups = 5
    # Within each of these 5 distinct CH2 groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic.
    # They are not made equivalent by rapid chair-flipping because the two chair conformers
    # are diastereomers and are not equally populated.
    protons_per_ring_ch2 = 2
    correct_ring_signals = num_distinct_ring_ch2_groups * protons_per_ring_ch2 # Correct count is 10

    # 1d. Rigorous Total Signal Count:
    # This is the theoretically correct number of signals.
    rigorous_total_signals = correct_ethyl_signals + correct_ring_signals # Correct total is 13

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the reasoning that leads to the provided answer of 8 ---
