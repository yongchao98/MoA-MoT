    # Reactant: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane
    # Reagent: Me2CuLi (provides a methyl nucleophile)
    # The final answer provided by the LLM to be checked is C.

    # --- Chemical Logic Simulation ---

    # Step 1: Analyze Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)
    # The rule is that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.
    # The epoxide is across C1 and C6.
    # C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to a methyl group), which is more hindered.
    # C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen), which is less hindered.
    # Therefore, the attack occurs at C6.
    attack_site = 6

    # Step 2: Determine Product Constitution
    # Attack at C6 opens the ring to form an alcohol at C1 and adds a new methyl group at C6.
    # For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is the new C1. The original C6 becomes the new C2.
    # The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

    # Step 3: Analyze Stereoselectivity

    # and retention of configuration at the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4).
