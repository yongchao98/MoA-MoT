Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.

**1. Understand the Core Question**
The question asks to identify which of the four listed organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecular structure is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

**2. Analyze the Reasoning in the Candidate Answers**
A review of the detailed candidate answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15) reveals a strong and consistent consensus on the chemical analysis of each compound, even though their final letter choices are inconsistent. The consensus reasoning is as follows:

*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
    *   **Careful Point:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The key feature to check is for restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings, a phenomenon known as atropisomerism.
    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the bulky substituents (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents free rotation, locking the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry.
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and is therefore optically active.

*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
    *   **Careful Point:** The key feature to check for is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).
    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and optically active.

*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**
    *   **Careful Point:** The key feature to check for is any element of symmetry that would make the molecule achiral.
    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly note that the molecule lacks a chiral center and possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O).
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and not optically active.

*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**
    *   **Careful Point:** This is a *trans* alkene. The key feature to check for is any element of symmetry.
    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that the molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry).
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and not optically active.

**3. Synthesize the Final Decision**
Based on the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1** and **2**.

**4. Match the Conclusion to the Options**
*   A) 2 and 3
*   B) 1, 2 and 4
*   C) 3 and 4
*   D) 1 and 2

The correct option that includes only compounds 1 and 2 is **D**. Many of the candidate answers provided incorrect final letters despite having the correct reasoning. The reasoning itself is the most reliable part of the provided information.
