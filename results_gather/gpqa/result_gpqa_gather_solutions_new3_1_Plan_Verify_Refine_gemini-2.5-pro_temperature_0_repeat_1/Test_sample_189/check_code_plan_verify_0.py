def check_nucleophile_ranking():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the nucleophile ranking based on established chemical principles.

    The question asks to rank the following nucleophiles from most reactive to poorest
    reactive in an aqueous (polar protic) solution:
    1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
    2. Hydroxide
    3. Propionate
    4. Methanol
    5. Ethanethiolate

    The provided answer is 'B', which corresponds to the order: 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4.
    This code verifies if this order is chemically sound.

    # --- Step 1: Define the nucleophiles and their properties ---
    # Properties are based on the rules of nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent:
    # - charge: Anionic (-1) is much better than neutral (0).
    # - atom: In a protic solvent, S > O due to polarizability and weaker solvation.
    # - resonance: False (localized charge) is better than True (delocalized charge).
    # - sterics: A numerical scale where a lower number means less steric hindrance and thus higher reactivity.

    # of the tuple in order to break ties. We sort in descending order of reactivity.
    # 1. Charge: `n['charge'] != 0` (True for anions, False for neutral). True > False.
    # 2. Atom: `n['atom'] == 'S'` (True for S, False for O). True > False.
    # 3. Resonance: `not n['resonance']` (True for no resonance, False for resonance). True > False.
