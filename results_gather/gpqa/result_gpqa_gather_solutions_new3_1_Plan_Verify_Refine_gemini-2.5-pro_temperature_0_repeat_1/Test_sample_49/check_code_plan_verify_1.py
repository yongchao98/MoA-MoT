### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The fundamental step is to recognize which part of the mathematical expression `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2` relates to the number of loops. In quantum field theory calculations performed in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral systematically contributes a factor of `1/(4pi)^2` to the final amplitude. This is a standard result from dimensional regularization.

2.  **Formulate the Equation:** Let `L` be the number of loops in the Feynman diagram. Based on the principle from Step 1, the total factor from all loops will be `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4pi)^(2L)`. The expression from the note contains the factor `1/(4pi)^6`. By equating these, we get the simple equation:
    `2L = 6`

3.  **Solve for the Number of Loops:** Solving the equation for `L` gives:
    `L = 6 / 2 = 3`
    Therefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.

4.  **Match with Options:** The question provides the following options:
    A) 6
    B) 2
    C) 1
    D) 3
    The calculated result, `L=3`, corresponds to option D.

5.  **Analyze Candidate Answers:** A review of the provided candidate answers shows that nearly all of them correctly identify the reasoning that leads to `L=3`. However, a significant majority then select a final option that contradicts their own reasoning. For example, many candidates correctly derive `L=3` but then output `<<<B>>>` (which is 2 loops) or `<<<C>>>` (which is 1 loop). This indicates a flaw in their final selection process, not in their physical understanding. The candidates that are fully consistent (correct reasoning leading to the correct final option) are a minority, but their conclusion is robust.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis of the loop integration factor `1/(4pi)^6` is the most direct and reliable method to determine the number of loops. The calculation unambiguously shows that the diagram contained 3 loops.
