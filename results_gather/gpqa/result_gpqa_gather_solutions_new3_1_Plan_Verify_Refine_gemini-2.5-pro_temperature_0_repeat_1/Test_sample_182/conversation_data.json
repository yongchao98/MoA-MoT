This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are also reduced to alkanes.\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclohexane** (based on IUPAC naming of the product, though the specific isomerism isn't critical for the formula). Let's re-evaluate the product name based on the starting material's numbering: the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n*   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   Two methyl groups (-CH₃) add 2 carbon atoms.\n*   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) adds 2 carbon atoms.\n*   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 (C₁₀).\n\nThe general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\nFor our product with 10 carbon atoms, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nUsing the IHD formula for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis IHD of 1 is accounted for by the single ring structure of the cyclohexane. Since all double bonds and oxygen-containing functional groups have been reduced, the only remaining feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency compared to an acyclic alkane (C₁₀H₂₂) is the ring itself.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula and Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    *   **Structure:** It consists of a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 1.\n        *   A formyl group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure. A cyclohexene ring has the base formula C6H10. Attaching four substituents (at C1, C2, C3, C5) removes four hydrogens, leaving C6H6 on the ring skeleton. The substituents are -H (at C3), -COOH, -CHO, and -CH=CH2. A more precise count based on the drawn structure (assuming standard valencies) gives C10H12O3.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n        *   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n    *   **IHD of Starting Material:** The IHD formula is `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`. For C10H12O3, the IHD is `10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   This IHD of 5 corresponds to: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group. This confirms the structural interpretation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds are reduced to saturated hydrocarbons.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will reduce all reducible groups in the starting molecule.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can be calculated from the molecular formula: `IHD = C - H/2 + 1`.\n    *   IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = **1**.\n    *   Alternatively, the IHD can be determined by counting the number of rings and pi bonds in the final structure. The product is a cyclohexane ring with alkyl substituents. It has one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI results in the complete reduction of all functional groups and double bonds, yielding a substituted cyclohexane. A saturated monocyclic compound always has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1, which accounts for the ring structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Identify the Starting Material and its Structure**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of rings and pi bonds: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) = **5**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reagent and the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkane groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still has a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nFor the product:\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula.\n*   Starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms. The reduction does not change the number of carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the saturated structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nLet's count them for the starting material:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of π bonds:\n    *   1 from the C=C in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 from the C=C in the vinyl group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the formyl group.\n    *   Total π bonds = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the IHD of the starting material is:\nIHD (start) = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the reagent.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\nThis combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes. The oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   -CHO (formyl group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n    *   -COOH (carboxylic acid group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C) by adding hydrogen across them.\n*   It does not break stable ring structures like cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product and its IHD.**\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the starting material:\n*   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group will be reduced (and the oxygen removed).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced (and both oxygens removed).\n\nEssentially, all the π bonds in the molecule are eliminated by the reduction. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring structure itself, as the cyclohexane ring is not opened by this reagent.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the final product.**\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings in product) + (Number of π bonds in product)\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains)\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (all C=C and C=O bonds are reduced)\n\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe final product is a substituted alkane with a single ring, so its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Starting Material: C10H12O3. IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5. Correct.\n*   Product: All functional groups and double bonds are reduced. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   IHD of Product: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1. The calculation confirms the result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user wants to find the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the structure of the reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  Determine the effect of the reagents (Red Phosphorus and excess HI) on the reactant's functional groups and points of unsaturation.\n3.  Deduce the structure of the final product.\n4.  Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reagents**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   This molecule contains a six-membered carbon ring (cyclohex).\n    *   It has a double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), which contains another double bond.\n    *   It has a formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI.\n    *   This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It reduces aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and alcohols completely to alkanes. It also saturates all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product**\nThe reaction will reduce all functional groups and points of unsaturation:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains the same. The product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The specific name would be 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. This is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)**\n\nFor the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Number of Rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds from the reactant have been saturated/reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. Starting Material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula of this compound.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of **10 carbon atoms**.\n\nLet's count the hydrogen atoms:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has 1 hydrogen.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) has 1 hydrogen.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) has 3 hydrogens.\n*   On the cyclohexene ring:\n    *   C1 has the -COOH group and is bonded to C2 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C2 has the -CHO group and is bonded to C1 and C3. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C3 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C2 and C4. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C4 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C3 and C5. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C5 has the vinyl group and is bonded to C4 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C6 is bonded to C1 and C5. It has 2 hydrogens.\n*   Total hydrogens = 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 2 (C6) = **12 hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecule also contains 2 oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid and 1 from the formyl group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\nIHD_start = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis can be verified by its structure: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nThe reaction with red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very strong reduction reaction.

The Product\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, so the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nAs the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4.

Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting material into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n*   The C₁₀ carbon skeleton will remain.\n*   The carboxylic acid group, formyl group, and both vinyl and ring double bonds will be fully reduced.\n*   All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n*   The initial ring structure will remain, but it will become a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe product will be a C₁₀ saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the reaction with red P and HI reduces all double bonds, the IHD of 1 must correspond to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane skeleton.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Structure:** It has a six-membered ring (cyclohexene) with one double bond.\n    *   **Functional Groups:**\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n        *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n        *   A carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring (at position 3).\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:**\n    *   The core ring is cyclohexene.

Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   The base structure is a cyclohex-3-ene ring.\n*   At position 1, there is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   At position 2, there is a formyl group (-CHO).\n*   At position 5, there is a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We start with a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₁₀) and substitute at positions 1, 2, and 5. This gives a C₆H₇ core. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 7 (core) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C₁₀H₁₂O₃, the IHD is:\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nTherefore, all the sites of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting material will be completely reduced.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group.\n\nThe final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the Product\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 1 in the first methyl group + 1 in the second methyl group + 2 in the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A cyclohexane ring has the formula C₆H₁₂. We replace three hydrogen atoms with the substituent groups, leaving C₆H₉. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 9 (ring) + 3 (first methyl) + 3 (second methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 20 hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nExcellent. The step-by-step constraint modeling and pruning successfully identified the correct answer.\n\nThe reasoning is confirmed:\n1.  **Reactant Structure:** The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, is a monocyclic compound.\n2.  **Reaction:** Red P and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent that converts all oxygen-containing functional groups (aldehydes, carboxylic acids) and all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (alkenes) into a saturated alkane.\n3.  **Product Structure:** The reaction preserves the single ring of the carbon skeleton but removes all pi bonds. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD is the sum of rings and pi bonds. For the product, this is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds), resulting in an IHD of 1.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product. To do this, I first need to identify the starting material's structure and molecular formula. Then, I must understand the reaction that occurs when \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\" is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI. This reagent is a strong reducing agent, and I need to determine which of the functional groups (aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and the two C=C double bonds) it will reduce. Once the product's structure is determined, I can find its molecular formula and calculate the IHD. My first action will be to search for the reactivity of these specific functional groups with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**Skeptic**: This approach is sound, but the critical point is the scope of the reduction by red phosphorus and HI. While it's well-known for reducing oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkanes, its effect on carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) is less common knowledge and must be verified. If the double bonds are also reduced, the IHD will be significantly lower than if they are not. A simple search might not be enough; we need to be certain about the reaction's outcome on all parts of the molecule.\n\n**Decide**: The immediate and most crucial step is to confirm the extent of the reduction caused by red phosphorus and excess HI, specifically whether it affects carbon-carbon double bonds in addition to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that red phosphorus with excess HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is capable of reducing carboxylic acids and aldehydes completely to their corresponding alkanes. Some sources also indicate that it can reduce alkenes (C=C double bonds) and alkynes. Therefore, my hypothesis is that all functional groups in the starting material will be reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n**Skeptic**: While the evidence is strong for the reduction of the oxygen-containing functional groups, the reduction of alkenes by this method is less consistently documented and can sometimes be substrate-dependent. However, given the \"excess HI\" condition and the general description of this reagent as one of the strongest, it is reasonable to assume the reduction of the double bonds as well. Let's proceed with this assumption, but it's the most likely point of error if the answer is incorrect.\n\n**Decide**: We will proceed by determining the product under the assumption that the reagent reduces the aldehyde, the carboxylic acid, and both carbon-carbon double bonds. We will then calculate the IHD of this final, fully saturated product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula.\n        *   The core structure is a cyclohexene ring: C6.\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH): C1, O2, H1.\n        *   It has a formyl group (-CHO): C1, O1, H1.\n        *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2): C2, H3.\n        *   Let's assemble the full carbon skeleton: A 6-membered ring with a 1-carbon chain (from COOH), another 1-carbon chain (from CHO), and a 2-carbon chain (from the vinyl group). This gives a total of 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final product will be a saturated hydrocarbon derivative of this C10 skeleton.\n\n2.  **Reaction**: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and excess HI.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Product Structure**:\n    *   The starting `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group becomes a `2-methyl` group.\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group becomes a `5-ethyl` group.\n    *   The `1-carboxylic acid` group becomes a `1-methyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Our product has a C10 skeleton (C6 ring + C1 methyl + C1 methyl + C2 ethyl = C10).\n    *   Since it is a single-ring alkane, its formula should be CnH2n.\n    *   For C10, the formula is C10H20.\n\n5.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**:\n    *   The IHD formula is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   For the product C10H20:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 0/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   Starting material correctly identified.\n*   Reaction's effect on all functional groups determined based on search results.\n*   Product structure correctly predicted based on the reaction.\n*   Molecular formula of the product (C10H20) is correct for a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   IHD calculation is correct based on both the formula and the structure (one ring).\n\nThe debate converges.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. To understand the reaction, we must first identify all the features that contribute to its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   **Ring:** There is one six-membered ring (the `cyclohex` part).\n*   **Pi Bonds (π bonds):**\n    1.

One C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH).\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 4 (π bonds) = 5.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane structures.\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n*   Crucially, it does not break the carbon ring skeleton.\n\n### 3. Determine the Product's Structure\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group is removed, converting it to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group is removed, converting it to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**. All the pi bonds have been eliminated, but the ring structure remains.\n\n### 4. Calculate the IHD of the Product\nThe IHD of the final product is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\n*   **Number of rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** 0 (all double bonds were reduced to single bonds).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis consistently shows that the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. Any saturated monocyclic alkane has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of exactly 1, which accounts for the ring. Many of the candidate answers correctly perform this analysis but then select the wrong option letter. The correct numerical answer is 1, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Let's re-evaluate the product name based on the starting material's numbering: the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n*   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   Two methyl groups (-CH₃) add 2 carbon atoms.\n*   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) adds 2 carbon atoms.\n*   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 (C₁₀).\n\nThe general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\nFor our product with 10 carbon atoms, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nUsing the IHD formula for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis IHD of 1 is accounted for by the single ring structure of the cyclohexane.

Let's determine its molecular formula and Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n    *   **Structure:** It consists of a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n        *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 1.\n        *   A formyl group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n        *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure. A cyclohexene ring has the base formula C6H10. Attaching four substituents (at C1, C2, C3, C5) removes four hydrogens, leaving C6H6 on the ring skeleton. The substituents are -H (at C3), -COOH, -CHO, and -CH=CH2. A more precise count based on the drawn structure (assuming standard valencies) gives C10H12O3.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n        *   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n    *   **IHD of Starting Material:** The IHD formula is `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`. For C10H12O3, the IHD is `10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   This IHD of 5 corresponds to: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group. This confirms the structural interpretation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds are reduced to saturated hydrocarbons.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will reduce all reducible groups in the starting molecule.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane.

By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of rings and pi bonds: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) = **5**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reagent and the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkane groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still has a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nFor the product:\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula.\n*   Starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms. The reduction does not change the number of carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the saturated structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nLet's count them for the starting material:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of π bonds:\n    *   1 from the C=C in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 from the C=C in the vinyl group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the formyl group.\n    *   Total π bonds = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the IHD of the starting material is:\nIHD (start) = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the reagent.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\nThis combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes. The oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   -CHO (formyl group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n    *   -COOH (carboxylic acid group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C) by adding hydrogen across them.\n*   It does not break stable ring structures like cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product and its IHD.**\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the starting material:\n*   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group will be reduced (and the oxygen removed).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced (and both oxygens removed).\n\nEssentially, all the π bonds in the molecule are eliminated by the reduction. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring structure itself, as the cyclohexane ring is not opened by this reagent.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the final product.**\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings in product) + (Number of π bonds in product)\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains)\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (all C=C and C=O bonds are reduced)\n\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe final product is a substituted alkane with a single ring, so its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Starting Material: C10H12O3. IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5. Correct.\n*   Product: All functional groups and double bonds are reduced. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   IHD of Product: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1. The calculation confirms the result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user wants to find the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.

Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reagents**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   This molecule contains a six-membered carbon ring (cyclohex).\n    *   It has a double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), which contains another double bond.\n    *   It has a formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI.\n    *   This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It reduces aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and alcohols completely to alkanes. It also saturates all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product**\nThe reaction will reduce all functional groups and points of unsaturation:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains the same. The product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The specific name would be 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. This is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)**\n\nFor the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Number of Rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds from the reactant have been saturated/reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. Starting Material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula of this compound.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of **10 carbon atoms**.\n\nLet's count the hydrogen atoms:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has 1 hydrogen.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) has 1 hydrogen.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) has 3 hydrogens.\n*   On the cyclohexene ring:\n    *   C1 has the -COOH group and is bonded to C2 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C2 has the -CHO group and is bonded to C1 and C3. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C3 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C2 and C4. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C4 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C3 and C5. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C5 has the vinyl group and is bonded to C4 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C6 is bonded to C1 and C5. It has 2 hydrogens.\n*   Total hydrogens = 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 2 (C6) = **12 hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecule also contains 2 oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid and 1 from the formyl group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\nIHD_start = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis can be verified by its structure: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nThe reaction with red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very strong reduction reaction. This reagent is capable of reducing several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Ketones are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, so the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nAs the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4.

Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting material into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n*   The C₁₀ carbon skeleton will remain.\n*   The carboxylic acid group, formyl group, and both vinyl and ring double bonds will be fully reduced.\n*   All oxygen atoms will be removed.\n*   The initial ring structure will remain, but it will become a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe product will be a C₁₀ saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4.

Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   The base structure is a cyclohex-3-ene ring.\n*   At position 1, there is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   At position 2, there is a formyl group (-CHO).\n*   At position 5, there is a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We start with a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₁₀) and substitute at positions 1, 2, and 5. This gives a C₆H₇ core. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 7 (core) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C₁₀H₁₂O₃, the IHD is:\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nTherefore, all the sites of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting material will be completely reduced.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group.\n\nThe final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the Product\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 1 in the first methyl group + 1 in the second methyl group + 2 in the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A cyclohexane ring has the formula C₆H₁₂.

The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD is the sum of rings and pi bonds. For the product, this is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds), resulting in an IHD of 1.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Proposer**: My goal is to determine the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product. To do this, I first need to identify the starting material's structure and molecular formula. Then, I must understand the reaction that occurs when \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\" is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI. This reagent is a strong reducing agent, and I need to determine which of the functional groups (aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and the two C=C double bonds) it will reduce. Once the product's structure is determined, I can find its molecular formula and calculate the IHD. My first action will be to search for the reactivity of these specific functional groups with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n**Skeptic**: This approach is sound, but the critical point is the scope of the reduction by red phosphorus and HI. While it's well-known for reducing oxygen-containing functional groups like aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkanes, its effect on carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) is less common knowledge and must be verified. If the double bonds are also reduced, the IHD will be significantly lower than if they are not. A simple search might not be enough; we need to be certain about the reaction's outcome on all parts of the molecule.\n\n**Decide**: The immediate and most crucial step is to confirm the extent of the reduction caused by red phosphorus and excess HI, specifically whether it affects carbon-carbon double bonds in addition to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups.\n\n**Proposer**: The search results confirm that red phosphorus with excess HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is capable of reducing carboxylic acids and aldehydes completely to their corresponding alkanes. Some sources also indicate that it can reduce alkenes (C=C double bonds) and alkynes. Therefore, my hypothesis is that all functional groups in the starting material will be reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n**Skeptic**: While the evidence is strong for the reduction of the oxygen-containing functional groups, the reduction of alkenes by this method is less consistently documented and can sometimes be substrate-dependent. However, given the \"excess HI\" condition and the general description of this reagent as one of the strongest, it is reasonable to assume the reduction of the double bonds as well. Let's proceed with this assumption, but it's the most likely point of error if the answer is incorrect.\n\n**Decide**: We will proceed by determining the product under the assumption that the reagent reduces the aldehyde, the carboxylic acid, and both carbon-carbon double bonds. We will then calculate the IHD of this final, fully saturated product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula.\n        *   The core structure is a cyclohexene ring: C6.\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH): C1, O2, H1.\n        *   It has a formyl group (-CHO): C1, O1, H1.\n        *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2): C2, H3.\n        *   Let's assemble the full carbon skeleton: A 6-membered ring with a 1-carbon chain (from COOH), another 1-carbon chain (from CHO), and a 2-carbon chain (from the vinyl group). This gives a total of 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final product will be a saturated hydrocarbon derivative of this C10 skeleton.\n\n2.  **Reaction**: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and excess HI.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Product Structure**:\n    *   The starting `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group becomes a `2-methyl` group.\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group becomes a `5-ethyl` group.\n    *   The `1-carboxylic acid` group becomes a `1-methyl` group.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Our product has a C10 skeleton (C6 ring + C1 methyl + C1 methyl + C2 ethyl = C10).\n    *   Since it is a single-ring alkane, its formula should be CnH2n.\n    *   For C10, the formula is C10H20.\n\n5.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation**:\n    *   The IHD formula is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   For the product C10H20:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 0/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n*   Starting material correctly identified.\n*   Reaction's effect on all functional groups determined based on search results.\n*   Product structure correctly predicted based on the reaction.\n*   Molecular formula of the product (C10H20) is correct for a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   IHD calculation is correct based on both the formula and the structure (one ring).\n\nThe debate converges. The reasoning is sound based on the available information.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
