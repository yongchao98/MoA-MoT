    Question: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when
    2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?

    Options: A) 1, B) 5, C) 3, D) 0

    Provided Answer: <<<A>>>
    """

    # Step 1: Define the problem parameters from the question
    # The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is the sum of rings and pi bonds.
    # We analyze the starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
    
    # Count rings in the starting material
    num_rings_start = 1  # From "cyclohex-"

    # Count pi bonds in the starting material
    pi_bonds_start = {
        "C=C in ring": 1,      # From "-3-ene"
        "C=C in vinyl": 1,     # From "5-vinyl" group (-CH=CH2)
        "C=O in formyl": 1,    # From "2-formyl" group (-CHO)
        "C=O in acid": 1       # From "-carboxylic acid" group (-COOH)
    }
    num_pi_bonds_start = sum(pi_bonds_start.values())

    # Step 2: Simulate the chemical reaction
    # The reagent is red phosphorus and excess HI, a very strong reducing agent.
    # Effect of the reaction:
    # - It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds to single bonds (eliminates all pi bonds).
    # - It does not break the ring structure.
    
    num_rings_product = num_rings_start  # The ring is preserved.
    num_pi_bonds_product = 0             # All pi bonds are reduced.

    # Step 3: Calculate the expected IHD of the product
    calculated_ihd = num_rings_product + num_pi_bonds_product

            f"4. All pi bonds from the starting material are eliminated. So, the product has 0 pi bonds.\n"
            f"5. Therefore, the calculated IHD of the product is (rings + pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = {calculated_ihd}.\n"
