    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux ratio question.

    The question asks for the approximate ratio of neutrino flux in two bands:
    Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV),
    assuming the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) has stopped.

    The final answer provided is B, which corresponds to 0.01.

    # With the pp-III branch stopped, the 8B neutrino flux is zero.
    # The remaining sources are:
    # - 7Be neutrinos (from pp-II branch): A strong, mono-energetic line at 861 keV.
    # - CNO neutrinos: A continuous spectrum across both bands.

    # --- Step 2: Use representative physical constants for an order-of-magnitude calculation ---
    # These values are based on standard solar models and data from experiments like Borexino,
    # as cited in the provided candidate answers. Units are neutrinos / (cm^2 * s).

    # Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):
    # The only source is the CNO cycle. We estimate the flux in this 100 keV window
    # by taking a fraction of the total CNO flux.
    # This is an approximation, but sufficient for an order-of-magnitude check.
