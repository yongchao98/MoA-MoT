def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the quantum physics question.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2.
    To "clearly resolve" two energy levels, their energy separation must be
    significantly greater than their energy widths (ΔE). The energy width is
    inversely proportional to the lifetime (τ), so ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

    The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, which
    is the limiting factor for resolution. A robust criterion for "clear"
    resolution is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of
    the individual energy widths.
