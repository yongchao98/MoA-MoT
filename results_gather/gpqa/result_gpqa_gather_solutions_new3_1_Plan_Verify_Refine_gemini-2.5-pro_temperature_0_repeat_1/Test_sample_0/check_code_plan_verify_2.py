def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer based on the physics of the problem.

    The core principle is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time:
    ΔE * τ ≥ ħ / 2
    
    For a state to be "clearly resolved", its energy difference from another state
    must be significantly larger than its energy uncertainty (ΔE), also known as the
    natural linewidth. The linewidth is approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

    The limiting factor for resolution is the state with the shorter lifetime, as it
    will have the larger energy uncertainty.
