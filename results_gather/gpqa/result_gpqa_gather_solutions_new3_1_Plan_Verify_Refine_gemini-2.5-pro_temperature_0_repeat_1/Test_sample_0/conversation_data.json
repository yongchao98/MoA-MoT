This concept is rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. The energy uncertainty, ΔE, represents the \"width\" of the energy level; it's not a perfectly sharp line.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties.

The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the two levels.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy width of the first state (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than the width of the second state (ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV).

This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is bounded by the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Terms:**\n    *   **Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a quantum state exists before it decays. In the context of the uncertainty principle, the lifetime of the state is the uncertainty in time, so Δt = τ.\n    *   **Energy Uncertainty (ΔE):** Due to its finite lifetime, a quantum energy level is not perfectly sharp. It has a natural \"width\" or \"spread\" in energy, which is the energy uncertainty ΔE. This is also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   **Resolvability:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two broadened levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy levels with widths ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Notice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (it is a \"broader\" line). This broader line is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n    *   For the two levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths. A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths, but being greater than the dominant (larger) width is a necessary minimum condition.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find the option for the energy difference |E1 - E2| that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This energy separation is large enough for the two broadened energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) is approximately 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. For practical purposes, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) is used as the uncertainty in time (Δt), leading to the relationship ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

This principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). For calculation, we use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n2.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   For the state with lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s, the energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶) / (10⁻⁹) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the state with lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s, the energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶) / (10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Resolvability Condition**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), which is the primary limiting factor. Therefore, the energy difference must be much greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Only an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure the two levels can be clearly resolved. The majority of the candidate answers that show their work perform this calculation correctly. Several answers arrive at an incorrect final letter (B, C, or D) because they appear to have analyzed a scrambled list of options, even though their physical reasoning correctly identified 10⁻⁴ eV as the only sufficient energy difference.\n\n<<<A>>>",

This concept is rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. The energy uncertainty, ΔE, represents the \"width\" of the energy level; it's not a perfectly sharp line.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties.

The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the two levels.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy width of the first state (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than the width of the second state (ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV). To resolve these two levels, their energy separation must be at least on the order of the larger width, ΔE1. A more rigorous condition for clear resolution is that the separation should be significantly greater than this width.\n\nSo, we need:\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n|E1 - E2| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nB) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nD) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy broadening of the states.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required energy difference.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is bounded by the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Terms:**\n    *   **Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a quantum state exists before it decays. In the context of the uncertainty principle, the lifetime of the state is the uncertainty in time, so Δt = τ.\n    *   **Energy Uncertainty (ΔE):** Due to its finite lifetime, a quantum energy level is not perfectly sharp. It has a natural \"width\" or \"spread\" in energy, which is the energy uncertainty ΔE. This is also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   **Resolvability:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two broadened levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy levels with widths ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Notice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (it is a \"broader\" line). This broader line is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n    *   For the two levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths. A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths, but being greater than the dominant (larger) width is a necessary minimum condition.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find the option for the energy difference |E1 - E2| that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. For practical purposes, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) is used as the uncertainty in time (Δt), leading to the relationship ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This ΔE is known as the natural line width of the energy state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty (line width) for each quantum state using the given lifetimes and the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their individual energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the larger of the two widths. In this case, the larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nWe now compare this required energy difference with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which sets a fundamental limit on the precision of a quantum state's energy based on its lifetime.\n\n**Constraint Modeling:**\n\n1.  **Energy Broadening:** A quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) does not have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"broadened\" or uncertain by an amount ΔE. The relationship is given by the uncertainty principle: ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation, we approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n2.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (E2 - E1) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths: |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.
