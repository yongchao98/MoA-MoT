def check_quantum_mechanics_answer():
    """
    Checks the derivation of the energy spectrum for the given potential.
    
    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines all necessary symbolic variables.
    2. Converts the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates.
    3. Calculates the angular frequencies for the x and y harmonic oscillators.
    4. Derives the total energy spectrum by summing the individual energies.
    5. Compares the derived result with the expression from the proposed answer (Option C).
    
    Returns:
        "Correct" if the derivation is sound and matches the answer.
        A string explaining the error if any step fails.
