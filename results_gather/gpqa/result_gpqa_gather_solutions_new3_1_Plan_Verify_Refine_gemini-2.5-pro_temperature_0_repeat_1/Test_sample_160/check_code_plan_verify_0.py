def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem about mean free paths.

    The problem compares:
    - λ1: Mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.
    - λ2: Mean free path of high-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules.

    The provided final answer is 'A', which corresponds to the option: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the fundamental formulas for Mean Free Path (MFP) ---
    # The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is number density and σ is cross-section.
    # The number density 'n' is constant in both scenarios and will cancel out in the ratio.

    # Formula for λ1 (gas-gas collisions):
    # A factor of sqrt(2) is introduced to account for the relative motion of all gas molecules.
    # λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)
    # where σ_gg is the gas-kinetic cross-section.

    # Formula for λ2 (electron-gas collisions):
    # The electrons are extremely fast (1000 kV), so the gas molecules are considered stationary.
    # The sqrt(2) factor is not present.
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    # where σ_eg is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.

    # --- Step 2: Derive the ratio of λ2 to λ1 ---
    # (λ2 / λ1) = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # (λ2 / λ1) = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # The ratio simplifies to:
    # ratio = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    
    # --- Step 3: Apply the key physical constraint on the cross-sections ---
    # This is the most critical part of the problem. We must compare σ_gg and σ_eg.
    # - σ_gg is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecule.
    # - σ_eg is the scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1 MeV) electron.
    #
    # For such high-energy, penetrating particles, the atom is mostly empty space. The probability
    # of a significant scattering event is low, making the effective target area small.
    # Therefore, the electron-gas cross-section is significantly SMALLER than the gas-gas cross-section.
    # This is a well-established principle in high-energy physics.
    
    # We can represent this as a constraint:
    # σ_gg / σ_eg > 1
    # For a robust check, let's assume σ_gg is at least slightly larger than σ_eg.
    # A conservative estimate would be that the ratio is greater than 1.
    # In reality, for 1 MeV electrons, σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg.
    
    sigma_ratio = "greater_than_1" # Represents the physical fact that σ_gg / σ_eg > 1

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the theoretical lower bound for the λ2/λ1 ratio ---
    sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(2)
    # Since ratio = sqrt_2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg) and (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1,
    # it follows that the ratio must be greater than sqrt_2.
    theoretical_ratio_lower_bound = sqrt_2
