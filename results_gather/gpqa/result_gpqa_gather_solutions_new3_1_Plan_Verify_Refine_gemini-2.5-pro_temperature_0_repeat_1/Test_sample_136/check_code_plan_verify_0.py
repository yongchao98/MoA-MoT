def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the synchrocyclotron problem.

    The calculation steps are as follows:
    1. Define the given physical constants and parameters.
    2. Convert all units to a consistent system (eV for energy, V for voltage).
    3. Calculate the energy gained by the proton in a single revolution. This involves:
       a. Finding the energy gain per acceleration event, which depends on the peak voltage and the synchronous phase.
       b. Multiplying by the number of accelerations per revolution (which is 2).
    4. Calculate the total number of revolutions by dividing the final kinetic energy by the energy gained per revolution.
    5. Round the result to the nearest integer, as the number of revolutions must be a whole number.
    6. Compare the calculated result with the value from the provided answer.
