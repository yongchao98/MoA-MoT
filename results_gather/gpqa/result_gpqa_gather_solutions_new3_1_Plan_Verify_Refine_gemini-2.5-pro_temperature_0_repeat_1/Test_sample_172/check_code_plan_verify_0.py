    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Question: If uncertainty in space of electron's location, which is travelling with speed v= 2* 10^8 m/s
    # along x-direction is Δx=0.1 nm . Based on the infromation estimate the minimum uncertainty in the
    # energy ΔE of electron.
    #
    # Options:
    # A) ~10^(-17) J
    # B) ~10^(-16) J
    # C) ~10^(-19) J
    # D) ~10^(-18) J
    #
    # Provided Answer: B

    # --- Constants and Given Values ---
    # Reduced Planck constant (J·s)
    h_bar = 1.054571817e-34
    # Uncertainty in position (m), given as 0.1 nm
    delta_x = 0.1e-9
    # Speed of the electron (m/s)
    v = 2e8

    # --- Physical Calculation ---
    # 1. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
    # The principle states Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2. For minimum uncertainty, we use the equality.
    # Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    try:
        delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Uncertainty in position (Δx) cannot be zero."

    # 2. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).
    # The relationship between the uncertainty in energy and momentum is given by ΔE ≈ v * Δp.
    # This is derived from the group velocity relation v = dE/dp, which holds for both
    # relativistic and non-relativistic cases.
    calculated_delta_E = v * delta_p
