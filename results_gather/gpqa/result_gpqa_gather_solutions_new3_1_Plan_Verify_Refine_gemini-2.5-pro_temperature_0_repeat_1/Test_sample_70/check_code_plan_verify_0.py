    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the exoplanet temperature ratio question.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).
    2.  Kepler's Third Law states that the orbital period squared (P^2) is proportional to the orbital distance cubed (a^3): P^2 ∝ a^3. This can be rearranged to a ∝ P^(2/3).
    3.  Combining these, we find the relationship between temperature and period: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).
    4.  Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 is equal to (P4/P2)^(-1/3), which simplifies to (P2/P4)^(1/3).
    5.  The code calculates this value using the given period ratios and compares it to the value of the selected option.
