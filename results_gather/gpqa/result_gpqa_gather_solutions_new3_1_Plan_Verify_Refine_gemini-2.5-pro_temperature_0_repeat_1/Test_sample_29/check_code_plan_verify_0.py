    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer based on physics principles.
    
    The core logic is:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy.
    2. Identify the color of the emitted light.
    3. Apply the Stokes Shift principle: The absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted light.
    4. From the valid options, determine the most plausible one (the one spectrally adjacent to the emitted color).
    5. Compare this derived correct answer with the provided answer.
