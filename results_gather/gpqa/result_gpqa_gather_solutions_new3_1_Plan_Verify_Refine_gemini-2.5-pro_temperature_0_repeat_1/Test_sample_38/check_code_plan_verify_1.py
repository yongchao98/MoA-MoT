def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given quantum mechanics problem.

    The core principle is the normalization of the wave function:
    The integral of the probability density |ψ(x)|² over the allowed space must equal 1.
    ∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1

    1.  The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.
    2.  The probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²
        |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.
    3.  The integral is ∫[1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx.
    4.  The analytical solution to this integral is [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3,
        which simplifies to: a² * ln(2) + 0.5.
    5.  Therefore, the normalization condition is: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
