Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

**1. Deconstruct the Question**
The core of the question is to identify the molecular mechanism that explains why the symptoms (phenotype) of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) are less severe than those of Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21).

**2. Analyze the Biological Difference Between the Syndromes**
*   **Klinefelter's Syndrome:** An aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes (an extra X).
*   **Down's Syndrome:** An aneuploidy of an autosome (an extra chromosome 21).
The fundamental difference lies in how the body handles an extra sex chromosome versus an extra autosome.

**3. Identify the Key Biological Process**
The vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly identify the key process as **X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)**, also known as Lyonization.
*   **What it is:** In mammals, to ensure gene dosage is equal between males (XY) and females (XX), one of the X chromosomes in every cell of a female is randomly and permanently silenced.
*   **How it applies to Klinefelter's:** In an XXY individual, this same mechanism activates. The cell recognizes there is more than one X chromosome and inactivates one of them, leaving one active X and one Y. This largely normalizes the expression of X-linked genes, bringing it much closer to the level seen in a typical XY male. This process significantly mitigates the genetic imbalance.
*   **Why it doesn't apply to Down's:** There is no equivalent, large-scale inactivation mechanism for autosomes. In Down's syndrome, all three copies of chromosome 21 remain active, leading to a ~50% overexpression of hundreds of genes. This creates a much larger disruption in cellular function, resulting in a more severe phenotype.

**4. Evaluate the Molecular Mechanisms in the Options**
Now, we must match the biological process (XCI) to the correct molecular description among the choices.

*   **A) progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst:** This relates to DNA replication, a general process necessary for all cell division, not the specific mechanism for silencing a chromosome.
*   **B) chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis:** This is a step in meiosis. An error here can *cause* aneuploidy (nondisjunction) but does not explain the difference in the *severity* of the resulting syndromes after fertilization.
*   **C) attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I:** Similar to option B, this is a meiotic process where errors can cause aneuploidy, but it does not explain the post-zygotic phenotypic differences.
*   **D) chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote:** This option perfectly describes a core molecular event of X-chromosome inactivation. XCI is an epigenetic process that occurs after fertilization ("post-zygote"). It involves modifying the chromatin to make it transcriptionally silent. A key step in this is the methylation of histone proteins by enzymes called histone methyltransferases, which creates repressive marks that lead to the formation of the condensed, inactive Barr body.

**5. Conclusion**
The less severe phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome is due to X-chromosome inactivation, which compensates for the extra X chromosome. The molecular mechanism central to this process is the epigenetic silencing of the chromosome, which involves chromatin methylation by enzymes like histone methyltransferases. This process occurs in the post-zygotic embryo. Therefore, option D is the correct description of the mechanism.

The analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus. Despite some confusion in the lettering of the options across different agents, the reasoning consistently points to the mechanism described in option D of the original question.
