    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the organic chemistry question.

    1. Deriving the correct IUPAC names for the products of both reactions based on chemical principles.
    2. Using the exact options provided in the original question as the ground truth for the choices.
    3. Comparing the provided answer ('A') against the derived correct answer ('D').
