    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to a question about the drug discovery workflow.

    The function encodes key principles of computational drug discovery to rank the options:
    1.  **Workflow Sequence:** Pharmacodynamics (binding) precedes pharmacokinetics (ADME).
    2.  **Avoiding Flawed Assumptions:** The "most stable form is the most active" is a known fallacy.
    3.  **Managing Complexity:** Acknowledging all isomers/tautomers is necessary.
    4.  **Robustness:** Integrating experimental validation is superior to purely predictive methods,
        especially before committing to extensive and resource-intensive studies.
