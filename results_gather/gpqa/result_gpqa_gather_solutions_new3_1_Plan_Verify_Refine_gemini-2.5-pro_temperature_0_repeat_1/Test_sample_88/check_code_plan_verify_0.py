This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of a three-step reaction sequence, culminating in the analysis of an NMR spectrum. The key to solving this problem is to use all pieces of information, especially the definitive chemical transformations, to navigate through some contradictory initial data.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Analyze the Overall Reaction Sequence:**
    *   The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.
    *   **Step 1** uses harsh basic conditions (KOH, 240°C) and produces a ketone (**Product 1**), confirmed by the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.
    *   **Step 2** uses aluminum isopropoxide, a reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol (**Product 2**).
    *   **Step 3** is an ozonolysis reaction (O₃ followed by DMS). This is the most crucial clue, as ozonolysis unambiguously cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This implies that **Product 2 must be an alkene**.

2.  **Resolve the Contradiction:**
    *   For Product 2 to be an alkene, it must have been formed from a precursor that either already contained a C=C bond or could easily form one.
    *   Since Product 2 comes from Product 1 (a ketone) via reduction, there are two main possibilities:
        a) Product 1 was an *unsaturated* ketone.
        b) Product 1 was a *saturated* ketone, which was reduced to an alcohol that then underwent dehydration (elimination of water) to form the alkene (Product 2).
    *   The provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 (integrating to 14H) suggests a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O, which corresponds to a *saturated* tricyclic ketone. An unsaturated ketone would have the formula C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradiction suggests the provided NMR data for Product 1 is either erroneous or refers to a different isomer, and we must rely on the chemical transformations to deduce the correct pathway.

3.  **Identify the Most Likely Pathway and Final Product (Product 3):**
    *   The question asks for the coupling pattern of the **most deshielded hydrogen atom**. In ¹H NMR, aldehyde protons (-CHO) are by far the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically appearing at δ 9-10 ppm. If the final product contains an aldehyde, this is the proton we must analyze.
    *   Let's evaluate the pathways to see which one produces an aldehyde. Ozonolysis with a reductive workup (DMS) converts a C=C bond into two carbonyl groups. If a carbon atom of the double bond is attached to a hydrogen, it becomes an aldehyde.
    *   Consider the pathway proposed by several of the candidate answers (e.g., Answer 1, Answer 9):
        *   **Product 1:** A rearrangement product, **protoadamant-4-en-2-one**. This is an unsaturated ketone (enone). This structure contains the C=C bond needed for ozonolysis. (We assume the 14H NMR data is a typo).
        *   **Product 2:** The ketone is reduced to an alcohol via MPV reduction, yielding **protoadamant-4-en-2-ol**. The C=C bond remains.
        *   **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of the C=C bond in Product 2. The double bond in the protoadamantene skeleton is between two carbons (C4 and C5) that are each bonded to one hydrogen atom. Therefore, ozonolysis cleaves this bond to form two aldehyde groups. The final product is a bicyclic structure containing an alcohol and two aldehyde groups: **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.

4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3:**
    *   **Product Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.
    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded. Let's analyze the coupling for one of them (e.g., the one attached to C3).
    *   **Coupling Analysis:**
        1.  **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon (H3). This coupling to one neighboring proton (n=1) will split the signal into a **doublet**.
        2.  **⁴J Long-Range Coupling:** In rigid cyclic systems like this, coupling over four bonds is often observed. The aldehyde proton is four bonds away from the two protons on the C4 methylene group (-CH₂-). This coupling to two equivalent protons (n=2) will split the signal into a **triplet**.
    *   **Final Pattern:** The signal for the aldehyde proton is split into a doublet by H3, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two H4 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.

This line of reasoning is chemically sound, accounts for all the reaction steps, and leads directly to one of the multiple-choice options by focusing on the most deshielded proton.
