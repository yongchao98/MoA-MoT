Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided 1H NMR data and the candidate answers.

### Step-by-step Analysis of the 1H NMR Data

The goal is to identify the unknown compound from the four options by interpreting its 1H NMR spectrum: `7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)`.

**Careful Point 1: Total Proton Count**
First, we sum the integration values of all signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule.
*   1H (at 7.0 ppm) + 1H (at 5.5 ppm) + 3H (at 2.1 ppm) + 3H (at 1.6 ppm) = **8 protons**.
*   Let's check the proton count for the options:
    *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂): Has 8 protons. **This matches.**
    *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂): Has 10 protons. **This does not match.**
*   **Conclusion:** This initial check immediately eliminates the butenyl acetate options (B and D). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.

**Careful Point 2: Stereochemistry from the Coupling Constant (J-value)**
The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between the two protons on the double bond (-CH=CH-).
*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is highly dependent on their geometry:
    *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.
    *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.
*   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.
*   **Conclusion:** This definitively eliminates the cis isomer (C). The compound must have a trans double bond.

**Careful Point 3: Confirmation with Splitting Patterns**
Combining the conclusions from the first two points, the compound must be **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that its structure matches all the signals.
*   **Structure:** Trans-propenyl acetate is CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃.
*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** The methyl group of the acetate (CH₃COO-) has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. **Matches.**
*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** The methyl group on the propenyl chain (CH₃-CH=) is adjacent to one proton on the double bond, so it appears as a doublet. **Matches.**
*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** The proton on the double bond adjacent to the methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) is coupled to the other vinylic proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets. **Matches.**
*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d):** The proton on the double bond adjacent to the oxygen (-O-CH=) is coupled only to the other vinylic proton, so it appears as a doublet. Its downfield chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen. **Matches.**
*   **Conclusion:** The entire spectrum is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.

**Careful Point 4: Mapping to the Final Answer**
The identified compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. According to the question's options:
*   A) Trans-propenyl acetate
*   B) Trans-butenyl acetate
*   C) Cis-propenyl acetate
*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate

The correct option is **A**. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most of them correctly deduce the structure through their reasoning, many of them select the wrong final letter. The correct reasoning consistently points to Trans-propenyl acetate.

<<<A>>>
