    # 1. Determine the limiting condition for Planet 2.
    # The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis (a2)
    # for which a transit can occur. The standard astronomical definition for this
    # limiting case (a "grazing" transit of the planet's center) is an impact
    # parameter of b2_max = 1.
    b2_max = 1.0

    # 2. Relate the semi-major axes of the two planets.
    # The impact parameter 'b' is given by b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s.
    # Since the inclination 'i' and stellar radius 'R_s' are the same for both
    # planets, the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of their
    # impact parameters: a2 / a1 = b2 / b1.

    # 3. Apply Kepler's Third Law.
    # (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3
    # We can solve for P2_max: P2_max = P1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2)
    ratio_p_squared = ratio_a ** 3
    P2_max = P1 * math.sqrt(ratio_p_squared)
