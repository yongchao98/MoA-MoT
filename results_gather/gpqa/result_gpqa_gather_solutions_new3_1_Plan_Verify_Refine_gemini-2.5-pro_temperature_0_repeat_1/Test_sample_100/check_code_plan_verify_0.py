    # --- Chemical Principles for Verification ---

    # 1. Reaction Type Analysis:
    # Reactant: 3-methylpyrrolidine (a secondary amine).
    # Product: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine (an enamine, with N-C=C bond).
    # The reaction is an enamine synthesis, which is a condensation reaction between a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone).

    # 2. Constraint on Reagent A:
    # The reagent must be a carbonyl compound that can form the product's "cyclohexylidenemethyl" group.
    # Retrosynthesis of the enamine product `(pyrrolidine)-N-CH=C(cyclohexane)` breaks the N-C bond and adds a carbonyl oxygen to the `CH` carbon.
    # This reveals the required carbonyl compound is `O=CH-(cyclohexane)`, which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
    # Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene and is not a suitable reactant for this transformation.
    correct_reagent_A = "cyclohexanecarbaldehyde"

    # 3. Constraint on Catalyst B:
    # The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration.
    # Both TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) and Acetic acid are acid catalysts.
    # However, TsOH is a strong acid, while acetic acid is a weak acid.
    # For dehydration reactions like enamine synthesis, a strong acid catalyst like TsOH is significantly more effective and is the standard, preferred choice to drive the reaction to completion, especially with heating.
    most_suitable_catalyst_B = "TsOH"
