    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics problem.
    
    The problem asks to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (<H>)
    with a specific transition energy (ΔE).
    
    1. Calculate the transition energy (ΔE) for a given wavelength.
    2. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy (<H>) for a given magnetic field.
    3. Compare the two energies to determine the correct relationship.
    4. Check if the provided final answer matches the derived correct relationship.
