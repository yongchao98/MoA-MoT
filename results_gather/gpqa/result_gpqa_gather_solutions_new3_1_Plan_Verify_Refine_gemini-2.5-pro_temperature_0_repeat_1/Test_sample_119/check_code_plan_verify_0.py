    This function uses symbolic mathematics to verify the derivation for the number
    of stars per unit parallax.

    The derivation steps are:
    1. The number of stars dN in a shell of radius d and thickness dd is dN = rho * 4*pi*d^2 * dd.
    2. The relationship between distance and parallax is d = 1/plx.
    3. We need to find dN/d(plx), which can be found using the chain rule:
       dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * |dd/d(plx)|
    4. We substitute d=1/plx and the derivative of d w.r.t. plx into the equation.
    5. The final simplified expression gives the proportionality.
