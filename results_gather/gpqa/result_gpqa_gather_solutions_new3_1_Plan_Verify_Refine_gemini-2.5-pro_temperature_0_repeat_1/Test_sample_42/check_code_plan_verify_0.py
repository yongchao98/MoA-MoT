    # Structure 2: C1-COOH, C2-N(CH3)2, C3-CHO, C4-OCH3, C5-CN, C6-OH. Here, 'cyano' is at C5.

    # The IUPAC tie-breaker rule states that when locant sets are identical, the lowest number
    # is assigned to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.
    # The alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.
    # 'cyano' comes first. Since 3 < 5, Structure 1 is the correct one.
