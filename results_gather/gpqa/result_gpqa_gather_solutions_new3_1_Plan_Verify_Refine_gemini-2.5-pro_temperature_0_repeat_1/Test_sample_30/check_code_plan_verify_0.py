    # p-nitrotoluene + MnO2/H2SO4 -> p-nitrobenzaldehyde
    # Rationale: The subsequent reaction (Claisen-Schmidt) requires an aldehyde.
    # While oxidation to a carboxylic acid is possible, it's not the logical
    # precursor for the next step in a multi-step synthesis problem.

    # Step 3: Condensation with Acetone

    # It has a single plane of symmetry (the molecular plane).
