The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton on molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic due to inductive effects and resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion. This is a classic \"umpolung\" (polarity reversal) reaction. Product **B** is the lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product, **C**, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used to deprotect the thioacetal. The two C-S bonds are cleaved, and the protecting group is removed, regenerating a carbonyl group. Since the carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product, **D**, is a ketone: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide) is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and BuLi. The ylide formed is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   This ylide then reacts with the ketone, D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The C=O bond of the ketone and the C=P bond of the ylide are replaced by a new C=C double bond.\n    *   The final product, **E**, is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Part 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nTo find the number of 13C-NMR signals, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.

Deconstruct the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify the final product, E. Let's analyze each reaction step:\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is the formation of a cyclic thioacetal to protect the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO). Ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) forms a 1,3-dithiolane ring.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton on A, which is the one on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, an example of \"umpolung\" (polarity inversion).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophile bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   These are conditions for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of a thioacetal. The protecting group is removed to reveal a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** The carbon that was protected is bonded to two ethyl groups, so the product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**.\n    *   Structure of D: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, a Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**.\n    *   Then, this ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond of the ketone is replaced by the C=C fragment from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E:** The final product is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique carbon signals for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n          |         |\n    CH₃-CH₂-C   =   C-CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoint of the C=C bond, perpendicular to the bond. This symmetry makes many carbon atoms chemically equivalent. For the purposes of a standard undergraduate NMR problem, the four ethyl groups are considered equivalent.\n\n*   **Identifying Equivalent Carbons:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically identical due to symmetry. This will result in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Because all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This will result in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent. This will result in **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn total, there are only three sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons in the highly symmetrical product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Therefore, its ¹³C-NMR spectrum will show 3 signals.\n\nThis matches option D in the provided question list.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus in the reasoning. The vast majority correctly identify the final product and use the symmetry argument to conclude there are 3 signals. Any discrepancies in the final letter choices of the candidates appear to be artifacts, while the underlying chemical logic is sound and points to 3 signals.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**1. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is a protection reaction. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A** is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   This is an acid-base reaction. Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton on Product A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature and stabilizing effect of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is an example of an \"umpolung\" or Corey-Seebach reaction.\n    *   **Product B** is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new C-C bond.\n    *   **Product C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection reaction. The thioacetal group is hydrolyzed back into a carbonyl group using reagents like mercuric chloride.\n    *   Since the carbon being deprotected is attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting carbonyl compound is a ketone.\n    *   **Product D** is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi.\n        1.  **Ylide Formation:** PPh₃ + (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr → [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻. This phosphonium salt is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   Then, the ylide reacts with the ketone (D, 3-pentanone). The C=O double bond is replaced with a C=C double bond.\n        (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    *   **Product E** is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product E**\n\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂.\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n             \\    /\n              C==C\n             /    \\\n      CH₃CH₂      CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a point of symmetry in the center of the C=C bond and multiple axes of rotation. Due to this symmetry, all four ethyl groups are chemically identical.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** In the four identical ethyl groups, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are chemically equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of unique carbon environments is 3. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the final product E will display 3 signals.\n\n**3.

Let's break down each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard reaction to protect a carbonyl group. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in product A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is a classic example of \"umpolung\" or polarity reversal.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. This is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: Product B, a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This attaches a second ethyl group to the C2 carbon of the dithiolane ring.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used to deprotect (hydrolyze) the thioacetal. The C-S bonds are cleaved, and the carbonyl group is regenerated.\n    *   **Product D**: The carbon that was bonded to two sulfur atoms and two ethyl groups becomes a carbonyl carbon. The product is therefore diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to convert the ketone (D) into an alkene.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus to create the phosphorus ylide: **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction**: The ylide reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon moiety from the ylide, forming a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product E**: The final product is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The systematic IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique carbon environments in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, to predict the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of E**:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. Regardless of whether the E or Z isomer is formed, or if we consider the most symmetrical E-isomer which is typically expected in such textbook problems, a high degree of symmetry exists. Let's analyze the most symmetrical case (the E-isomer, which has a center of symmetry).\n    1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (`=C<`) are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  All four ethyl groups (`-CH₂CH₃`) attached to the double bond are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  Because the four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons (`-CH₂-`) are also chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n    4.  Similarly, the four methyl carbons (`-CH₃`) at the ends of the ethyl groups are chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: There are three distinct sets of chemically equivalent carbons in the molecule:\n    1.  The two alkene carbons.\n    2.  The four methylene carbons.\n    3.  The four methyl carbons.\n\nTherefore, the final product E will produce a total of **3 signals** in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 6\nC) 11\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the final product, E.**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves several standard organic transformations:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: This is the protection of an aldehyde as a cyclic thioacetal. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane (**A**).\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. This forms a lithiated carbanion (**B**), which is a powerful nucleophile (an example of umpolung).\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (**B**) attacks bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane (**C**).\n4.  **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**: These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group. Since the carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone (**D**).\n5.  **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, the reagents form a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane. The ylide is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n\nThe final product **E** is formed by joining the two molecular fragments: `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` from the ketone and `=C(CH₂CH₃)₂` from the ylide.\n\nTherefore, the structure of **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**:\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for product E.**\n\nTo find the number of signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical.\n*   **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry (e.g., a C₂ rotation axis perpendicular to the double bond).

All agents, despite minor variations in their descriptions, largely agree on the chemical transformations. Let's trace the consensus pathway:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard protection of the aldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) with ethane-1,2-dithiol to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane. A second ethyl group is added to the C2 position.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents deprotect the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D**: The carbon that was bonded to the two ethyl groups becomes a carbonyl carbon. The product is **3-pentanone** (or diethyl ketone).\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    CH₃CH₂-C-CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to first form a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane, which then reacts with the ketone (D).\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: 3-bromopentane, `(CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr`, reacts with PPh₃ and BuLi to form the ylide `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction**: The ylide reacts with 3-pentanone, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`. The reaction joins the two carbon backbones via a new double bond.\n    *   **Product E**: The final product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n    ```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of chemically non-equivalent carbons in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This is achieved by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has four ethyl groups attached to a central carbon-carbon double bond, `(Et)₂C=C(Et)₂`.\n*   **Symmetry**: This structure is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond. This symmetry ensures that the two halves of the molecule are identical. Furthermore, the two ethyl groups on each carbon of the double bond are also identical. As a result, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting Signals**:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are also in identical chemical environments. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nAdding these up, the total number of unique carbon signals is 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers correctly follow this line of reasoning, deriving the structure of E and concluding that its high symmetry leads to 3 ¹³C-NMR signals.\n*   **Answers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15** all correctly deduce that there should be 3 signals based on the symmetrical structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n*   **Answer 4** provides an incorrect analysis, suggesting a mixture of E/Z isomers. This is chemically incorrect for the final product, as E/Z isomerism is not possible when identical groups are attached to the same vinylic carbon. This leads to its incorrect conclusion of 8 signals.\n\nBased on the overwhelming consensus of the correct chemical principles, the final product E has **3** distinct carbon environments.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\nA) 11\nB) 8\nC) 3\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe task is to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product E of a multi-step organic synthesis. To do this, we must first deduce the structure of E by following the reaction sequence step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **Step A: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   This is the protection of an aldehyde's carbonyl group using a dithiol. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.**\n\n2.  **Step B: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in product A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the two adjacent sulfur atoms (this is known as an Umpolung, or Corey-Seebach reaction).\n    *   **Product B is a lithiated carbanion**, a potent nucleophile at the C2 position.\n\n3.  **Step C: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion (B) reacts with the electrophile bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position.\n    *   **Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.**\n\n4.  **Step D: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal group, converting it back to a carbonyl group.\n    *   The C2 carbon of the dithiolane, which is bonded to two ethyl groups, is converted to a carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Product D is diethyl ketone, or 3-pentanone: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.**\n\n5.  **Step E: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to first create a phosphorus ylide, which then reacts with the ketone D.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr). The resulting phosphonium salt is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**.\n    *   **Wittig Coupling**: The ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    *   **Product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.**\n\n### Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique carbon signals for E, **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n          |         |\n    CH₃-CH₂-C   =   C-CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n    Or more symmetrically:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ rotational axis perpendicular to the center of the C=C bond. This symmetry makes pairs of carbons chemically equivalent.\n    *   It is important to note that since each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical ethyl groups, there are **no E/Z isomers** possible for this molecule.\n\n*   **Identifying Unique Carbons:**\n    1.  **Alkene carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons of the ethyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three sets of chemically equivalent carbons. The ¹³C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show **3 signals**.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 6\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 8\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Multi-step Synthesis**\n\nThe first crucial task is to determine the chemical structure of the final product, E. This requires a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product, A, is a cyclic thioacetal: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi (butyllithium) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic hydrogen in molecule A. The hydrogen on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B. This reaction type is known as umpolung or the Corey-Seebach reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophile bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds an ethyl group to the carbon atom between the sulfurs. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    These reagents are used to deprotect the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group. The starting material for this step (C) has two ethyl groups attached to the protected carbon. The product, D, is therefore diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and the base BuLi. The fragment from 3-bromopentane is `(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-`. The ylide formed is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step, D (3-pentanone, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The C=O group of the ketone is replaced by the C=C fragment from the ylide.\n\n*   **Final Product E:** The reaction `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃` yields the alkene `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`. The systematic name for this product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. 13C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe second task is to determine the number of unique carbon signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene). This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   There is no E/Z isomerism possible because each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups). The argument presented in Answer 4 is therefore incorrect.\n    *   Due to the molecule's high symmetry (it possesses a center of inversion and a C₂ axis), many carbons are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn total, there are only three distinct types of carbon atoms in the final product. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum will show 3 signals. Looking at the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 3\nB) 6\nC) 8\nD) 11\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option A. The majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the product and deduce the number of signals to be 3, although some make clerical errors when selecting their final lettered option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe core of the problem is to first correctly identify the structure of the final product, E. Let's analyze the five-step reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde (propionaldehyde) as a cyclic thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. All candidate answers correctly identify this general transformation.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi (butyllithium) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic hydrogen. In product A, the hydrogen on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by the two sulfur atoms (a process known as umpolung or the Corey-Seebach reaction). Product B is a nucleophilic carbanion. This step is correctly identified by all agents who detail the process.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophile bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction. A new ethyl group is attached to the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This step is also correctly identified.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    These are standard conditions for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of a thioacetal/thioketal. The protecting group is removed to regenerate a carbonyl group. Since the carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, Product D is a ketone: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone). This step is correctly identified by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents form a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane, which then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).\n    *   **Ylide formation:** 3-bromopentane + PPh₃ → phosphonium salt. The salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃). The C=O group is replaced by the C=C group from the ylide.\n    *   **Final Product E:** (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Conclusion of Synthesis:** There is a near-unanimous consensus among the candidate answers that the final product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This conclusion is chemically sound.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique carbon environments in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This is based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n             \\     /\n              C === C\n             /     \\\n      CH₃CH₂       CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the C=C double bond, and an inversion center. This symmetry has a direct impact on the number of NMR signals.\n    *   **The Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **The Ethyl Groups (-CH₂CH₃):** All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the overall symmetry.\n    *   **The Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Because the four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **The Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl carbons are all equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** 1 (from C=C) + 1 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from -CH₃) = **3 signals**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\n*   Most candidates (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 6, 7, 13, and others with correct reasoning) correctly identify the product and deduce from its symmetry that it will have **3** signals.\n*   Answer 4 incorrectly suggests a mixture of E/Z isomers, leading to a faulty conclusion of 8 signals. This premise is wrong because E/Z isomerism is not possible for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene (swapping the two ethyl groups on a vinylic carbon results in the same molecule).\n*   The overwhelming consensus based on correct chemical principles is that there are 3 signals.\n*   Looking at the provided options: A) 11, B) 3, C) 8, D) 6.\n*   The correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product, E**\n\nThe problem requires analyzing a five-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This is a standard protection reaction for carbonyls, forming a cyclic thioacetal. The product **A** is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Product A is treated with butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base. BuLi removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion. This is a Corey-Seebach reaction (an example of umpolung). Product **B** is the **lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion**, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B reacts with bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the electrophilic ethyl group, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new C-C bond. Product **C** is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: Product C is treated with reagents for thioacetal hydrolysis (deprotection). The protecting group is removed, and the carbonyl group is restored. Since the carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**. Product **D** is **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O**.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, a Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide) is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and BuLi. The ylide is **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**. This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    The overall reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    The final product **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nThe structure of E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is highly symmetrical:\n\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂ \\      / CH₂-CH₃\n               C = C\n      CH₃-CH₂ /      \\ CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry (e.g., a C₂ rotation axis passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond). Therefore, they will produce only **one signal**.\n\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (`-CH₂-`)**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the double bond. The overall symmetry makes all four of these ethyl groups equivalent. Consequently, the four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are all equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (`-CH₃`)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the four equivalent ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct sets of chemically equivalent carbons.

Let's trace the transformation at each step to identify the final product, E.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard reaction to protect an aldehyde. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The product **A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two electron-withdrawing sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic. This deprotonation creates a carbanion, which is a powerful nucleophile. This type of reaction is known as Umpolung (polarity reversal). Product **B is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion**.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This attaches a second ethyl group to the C2 position. Product **C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal group, regenerating the carbonyl. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone (D)**. Its structure is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to create a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, **Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂**.\n    *   Next, the ketone (D, 3-pentanone) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   The final product **E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:\n\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\nThis molecule can be represented as Et₂C=CEt₂, where Et is an ethyl group.\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically distinct carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry**: The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ rotational axis passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond and perpendicular to the plane of the alkene. This symmetry makes the top and bottom halves of the molecule identical, and the left and right halves identical.\n2.  **Unique Carbons**:\n    *   **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two sp²-hybridized carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: There are four ethyl groups. The symmetry of the molecule makes all four of these ethyl groups equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons (-CH₂-) are all chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons (-CH₃) from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, there are only three sets of chemically equivalent carbons. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical synthesis produces 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. A ¹³C-NMR analysis based on its symmetrical structure predicts 3 signals.

The reagents are used to first create a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane, which then reacts with the ketone D.\n    *   Ylide formation: 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) + PPh₃ followed by BuLi creates the ylide (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   Wittig reaction: The ketone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃) to form an alkene.\n    *   Product E is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**, with the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique carbon environments in the final product, E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene).\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                \\ /\n                 C=C\n                / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.

Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of distinct carbon signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum is the sum of the unique environments: 1 (for `=C<`) + 1 (for `-CH₂-`) + 1 (for `-CH₃`) = **3 signals**.\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) 6\nB) 8\nC) 11\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 3.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part 1: Elucidating the Structure of the Final Product (E)\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard reaction for the protection of an aldehyde using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It abstracts the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the C2 position) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, **B** (the lithium salt of the dithiolane anion), in a process known as umpolung.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product, **C**, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal group, regenerating the carbonyl functional group. The two ethyl groups remain attached to what is now the carbonyl carbon. The product, **D**, is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    *   The final product, **E**, is formed by combining the two fragments: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. This molecule is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### Part 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E\n\nTo find the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

There is a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond, and a plane of symmetry containing the C=C bond. This high degree of symmetry makes several groups of carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. Therefore, they will produce a single signal.\n    *   Number of signals: **1**\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons**: The overall symmetry makes all four ethyl groups (`-CH₂CH₃`) chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze the carbons within one ethyl group.\n    *   **Methylene Carbons (`-CH₂-`)**: The four methylene carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (`-CH₃`)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. They will also produce a single signal.\n    *   Number of signals from the ethyl groups: **2**\n\n**Total Number of Signals**: Adding the signals from all unique carbon types:\n1 (from alkene carbons) + 1 (from methylene carbons) + 1 (from methyl carbons) = **3 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

The product is a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic due to inductive stabilization from the sulfurs. This process (Corey-Seebach reaction) creates a nucleophilic carbon anion (umpolung).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic anion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding an ethyl group.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection step. The thioacetal is hydrolyzed back into a carbonyl group. Since the starting carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed.\n    *   **Product D:** Diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction.

The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   Then, the ketone (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E:** The final product is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, which is named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe key to determining the number of NMR signals is to analyze the molecular symmetry of the final product, E.\n\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical.

Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A** is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   This is an acid-base reaction. Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton on Product A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature and stabilizing effect of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is an example of an \"umpolung\" or Corey-Seebach reaction.\n    *   **Product B** is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new C-C bond.\n    *   **Product C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection reaction. The thioacetal group is hydrolyzed back into a carbonyl group using reagents like mercuric chloride.\n    *   Since the carbon being deprotected is attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting carbonyl compound is a ketone.\n    *   **Product D** is 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi.\n        1.  **Ylide Formation:** PPh₃ + (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr → [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻. This phosphonium salt is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   Then, the ylide reacts with the ketone (D, 3-pentanone). The C=O double bond is replaced with a C=C double bond.\n        (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    *   **Product E** is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**2. ¹³C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product E**\n\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂.\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n             \\    /\n              C==C\n             /    \\\n      CH₃CH₂      CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a point of symmetry in the center of the C=C bond and multiple axes of rotation. Due to this symmetry, all four ethyl groups are chemically identical.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** In the four identical ethyl groups, the four methylene carbons are also chemically equivalent to each other. This results in **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are chemically equivalent. This results in **one signal**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The total number of unique carbon environments is 3. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of the final product E will display 3 signals.\n\n**3.

Let's break down each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard reaction to protect a carbonyl group. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in product A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is a classic example of \"umpolung\" or polarity reversal.\n    *   **Product B**: The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion. This is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: Product B, a nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This attaches a second ethyl group to the C2 carbon of the dithiolane ring.\n    *   **Product C**: 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used to deprotect (hydrolyze) the thioacetal. The C-S bonds are cleaved, and the carbonyl group is regenerated.\n    *   **Product D**: The carbon that was bonded to two sulfur atoms and two ethyl groups becomes a carbonyl carbon. The product is therefore diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to convert the ketone (D) into an alkene.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus to create the phosphorus ylide: **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction**: The ylide reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon moiety from the ylide, forming a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Product E**: The final product is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The systematic IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Step 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique carbon environments in the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, to predict the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of E**:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. Regardless of whether the E or Z isomer is formed, or if we consider the most symmetrical E-isomer which is typically expected in such textbook problems, a high degree of symmetry exists. Let's analyze the most symmetrical case (the E-isomer, which has a center of symmetry).\n    1.  The two carbons of the central double bond (`=C<`) are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  All four ethyl groups (`-CH₂CH₃`) attached to the double bond are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  Because the four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons (`-CH₂-`) are also chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n    4.  Similarly, the four methyl carbons (`-CH₃`) at the ends of the ethyl groups are chemically equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: There are three distinct sets of chemically equivalent carbons in the molecule:\n    1.  The two alkene carbons.\n    2.  The four methylene carbons.\n    3.  The four methyl carbons.\n\nTherefore, the final product E will produce a total of **3 signals** in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 6\nC) 11\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the final product, E.**\n\nThe reaction sequence involves several standard organic transformations:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: This is the protection of an aldehyde as a cyclic thioacetal.

This forms a lithiated carbanion (**B**), which is a powerful nucleophile (an example of umpolung).\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (**B**) attacks bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane (**C**).\n4.  **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**: These reagents are used for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group. Since the carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the product is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone (**D**).\n5.  **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, the reagents form a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane. The ylide is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n\nThe final product **E** is formed by joining the two molecular fragments: `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` from the ketone and `=C(CH₂CH₃)₂` from the ylide.\n\nTherefore, the structure of **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**:\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for product E.**\n\nTo find the number of signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical.\n*   **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry (e.g., a C₂ rotation axis perpendicular to the double bond).

All agents, despite minor variations in their descriptions, largely agree on the chemical transformations. Let's trace the consensus pathway:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard protection of the aldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) with ethane-1,2-dithiol to form a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A**: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that removes the acidic proton from the carbon between the two sulfur atoms.

This is achieved by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has four ethyl groups attached to a central carbon-carbon double bond, `(Et)₂C=C(Et)₂`.\n*   **Symmetry**: This structure is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond. This symmetry ensures that the two halves of the molecule are identical. Furthermore, the two ethyl groups on each carbon of the double bond are also identical. As a result, all four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting Signals**:\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: Since all four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other.

This is chemically incorrect for the final product, as E/Z isomerism is not possible when identical groups are attached to the same vinylic carbon. This leads to its incorrect conclusion of 8 signals.\n\nBased on the overwhelming consensus of the correct chemical principles, the final product E has **3** distinct carbon environments.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\nA) 11\nB) 8\nC) 3\nD) 6\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe task is to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product E of a multi-step organic synthesis.

The reagents are used to first create a phosphorus ylide, which then reacts with the ketone D.\n    *   **Ylide Formation**: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr). The resulting phosphonium salt is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**.\n    *   **Wittig Coupling**: The ketone D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n    *   **Product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.**\n\n### Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique carbon signals for E, **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n          |         |\n    CH₃-CH₂-C   =   C-CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n    Or more symmetrically:\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n                \\  /\n                 C=C\n                /  \\\n          CH₃CH₂    CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.

This requires a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product, A, is a cyclic thioacetal: 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi (butyllithium) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic hydrogen in molecule A. The hydrogen on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, B. This reaction type is known as umpolung or the Corey-Seebach reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophile bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds an ethyl group to the carbon atom between the sulfurs. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    These reagents are used to deprotect the thioacetal, converting it back to a carbonyl group. The starting material for this step (C) has two ethyl groups attached to the protected carbon. The product, D, is therefore diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. First, a phosphorus ylide is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and the base BuLi. The fragment from 3-bromopentane is `(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-`. The ylide formed is `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃`. This ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step, D (3-pentanone, `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O`). The C=O group of the ketone is replaced by the C=C fragment from the ylide.\n\n*   **Final Product E:** The reaction `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃` yields the alkene `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂`. The systematic name for this product is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. 13C-NMR Analysis of the Final Product (E)**\n\nThe second task is to determine the number of unique carbon signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene). This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   There is no E/Z isomerism possible because each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (two ethyl groups). The argument presented in Answer 4 is therefore incorrect.\n    *   Due to the molecule's high symmetry (it possesses a center of inversion and a C₂ axis), many carbons are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the Unique Carbon Environments:**\n    1.  **Alkene carbons (=C<):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments. They will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. Therefore, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** Likewise, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn total, there are only three distinct types of carbon atoms in the final product. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum will show 3 signals. Looking at the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 3\nB) 6\nC) 8\nD) 11\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option A. The majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the product and deduce the number of signals to be 3, although some make clerical errors when selecting their final lettered option.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe core of the problem is to first correctly identify the structure of the final product, E. Let's analyze the five-step reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde (propionaldehyde) as a cyclic thioacetal using ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT). The product A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane. All candidate answers correctly identify this general transformation.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    BuLi (butyllithium) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic hydrogen. In product A, the hydrogen on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by the two sulfur atoms (a process known as umpolung or the Corey-Seebach reaction). Product B is a nucleophilic carbanion. This step is correctly identified by all agents who detail the process.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion B attacks the electrophile bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction. A new ethyl group is attached to the carbon between the two sulfur atoms. Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane. This step is also correctly identified.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    These are standard conditions for the deprotection (hydrolysis) of a thioacetal/thioketal. The protecting group is removed to regenerate a carbonyl group. Since the carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, Product D is a ketone: 3-pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone). This step is correctly identified by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents form a phosphorus ylide from 3-bromopentane, which then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone).\n    *   **Ylide formation:** 3-bromopentane + PPh₃ → phosphonium salt. The salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction:** The ketone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃). The C=O group is replaced by the C=C group from the ylide.\n    *   **Final Product E:** (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**Conclusion of Synthesis:** There is a near-unanimous consensus among the candidate answers that the final product E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This conclusion is chemically sound.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nNow we must determine the number of unique carbon environments in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. This is based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n             \\     /\n              C === C\n             /     \\\n      CH₃CH₂       CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ rotational axis passing through the center of the C=C double bond, and an inversion center. This symmetry has a direct impact on the number of NMR signals.\n    *   **The Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **The Ethyl Groups (-CH₂CH₃):** All four ethyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the overall symmetry.\n    *   **The Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** Because the four ethyl groups are equivalent, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **The Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl carbons are all equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** 1 (from C=C) + 1 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from -CH₃) = **3 signals**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Candidate Answers and Final Decision**\n\n*   Most candidates (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 6, 7, 13, and others with correct reasoning) correctly identify the product and deduce from its symmetry that it will have **3** signals.\n*   Answer 4 incorrectly suggests a mixture of E/Z isomers, leading to a faulty conclusion of 8 signals. This premise is wrong because E/Z isomerism is not possible for 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene (swapping the two ethyl groups on a vinylic carbon results in the same molecule).\n*   The overwhelming consensus based on correct chemical principles is that there are 3 signals.\n*   Looking at the provided options: A) 11, B) 3, C) 8, D) 6.\n*   The correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product, E**\n\nThe problem requires analyzing a five-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This is a standard protection reaction for carbonyls, forming a cyclic thioacetal. The product **A** is **2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Product A is treated with butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base. BuLi removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic due to the stabilizing effect of the sulfur atoms on the resulting carbanion. This is a Corey-Seebach reaction (an example of umpolung). Product **B** is the **lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion**, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion B reacts with bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the electrophilic ethyl group, displacing the bromide ion and forming a new C-C bond. Product **C** is **2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: Product C is treated with reagents for thioacetal hydrolysis (deprotection). The protecting group is removed, and the carbonyl group is restored. Since the carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone**. Product **D** is **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=O**.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, a Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide) is formed from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and BuLi. The ylide is **(CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃**. This ylide then reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    The overall reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    The final product **E** is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nThe structure of E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is highly symmetrical:\n\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂ \\      / CH₂-CH₃\n               C = C\n      CH₃-CH₂ /      \\ CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons of the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry (e.g., a C₂ rotation axis passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond). Therefore, they will produce only **one signal**.\n\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (`-CH₂-`)**: There are four ethyl groups attached to the double bond. The overall symmetry makes all four of these ethyl groups equivalent. Consequently, the four methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are all equivalent to each other. This will produce **one signal**.\n\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (`-CH₃`)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the four equivalent ethyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, there are three distinct sets of chemically equivalent carbons. The ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will therefore show **3 signals**.\n\n### **Step 3: Select the Correct Option**\n\nThe question provides the following options:\nA) 11\nB) 6\nC) 3\nD) 8\n\nOur analysis concludes that there will be 3 signals, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a systematic analysis of the provided information to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Synthesis Analysis**\n\nThe reaction sequence is a multi-step organic synthesis. Let's trace the transformation at each step to identify the final product, E.\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**: This is a standard reaction to protect an aldehyde. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with ethane-1,2-dithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The product **A is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon atom between the two electron-withdrawing sulfur atoms (C2 of the dithiolane ring) is acidic. This deprotonation creates a carbanion, which is a powerful nucleophile. This type of reaction is known as Umpolung (polarity reversal). Product **B is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion**.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This attaches a second ethyl group to the C2 position. Product **C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane**.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal group, regenerating the carbonyl. Since the protected carbon was attached to two ethyl groups, the resulting ketone is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone (D)**. Its structure is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr) to create a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, **Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂**.\n    *   Next, the ketone (D, 3-pentanone) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n    *   The reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃P=O.\n    *   The final product **E is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### **¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:\n\n```\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n```\nThis molecule can be represented as Et₂C=CEt₂, where Et is an ethyl group.\n\nTo find the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically distinct carbon atoms by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Symmetry**: The molecule is highly symmetrical. There is a C₂ rotational axis passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond and perpendicular to the plane of the alkene. This symmetry makes the top and bottom halves of the molecule identical, and the left and right halves identical.\n2.  **Unique Carbons**:\n    *   **Alkene Carbons (=C<)**: The two sp²-hybridized carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-)**: There are four ethyl groups. The symmetry of the molecule makes all four of these ethyl groups equivalent. Therefore, the four methylene carbons (-CH₂-) are all chemically equivalent to each other. They will produce **one signal**.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons (-CH₃) from the four equivalent ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**.\n\nIn total, there are only three sets of chemically equivalent carbons. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of product E will show **3 signals**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical synthesis produces 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

The product, **A**, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It abstracts the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the C2 position) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent sulfur atoms. This creates a nucleophilic carbanion, **B** (the lithium salt of the dithiolane anion), in a process known as umpolung.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position. The product, **C**, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: These reagents are used for the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal group, regenerating the carbonyl functional group. The two ethyl groups remain attached to what is now the carbonyl carbon. The product, **D**, is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is formed: Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   The ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n    *   The final product, **E**, is formed by combining the two fragments: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. This molecule is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### Part 2: 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E\n\nTo find the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.

There is a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond, and a plane of symmetry containing the C=C bond. This high degree of symmetry makes several groups of carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (`=C<`)**: The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. Therefore, they will produce a single signal.\n    *   Number of signals: **1**\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons**: The overall symmetry makes all four ethyl groups (`-CH₂CH₃`) chemically equivalent.

They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Methyl Carbons (`-CH₃`)**: Similarly, the four terminal methyl carbons are all chemically equivalent to each other. They will also produce a single signal.\n    *   Number of signals from the ethyl groups: **2**\n\n**Total Number of Signals**: Adding the signals from all unique carbon types:\n1 (from alkene carbons) + 1 (from methylene carbons) + 1 (from methyl carbons) = **3 signals**.\n\nThis matches option D in the original question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

The product is a cyclic thioacetal.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    *   Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic due to inductive stabilization from the sulfurs. This process (Corey-Seebach reaction) creates a nucleophilic carbon anion (umpolung).\n    *   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane anion.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   The nucleophilic anion B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding an ethyl group.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   This is a deprotection step. The thioacetal is hydrolyzed back into a carbonyl group. Since the starting carbon was bonded to two ethyl groups, a ketone is formed.\n    *   **Product D:** Diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   This is a Wittig reaction. The reagents are used to convert the ketone D into an alkene.\n    *   First, a Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   Then, the ketone (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O) reacts with the ylide. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E:** The final product is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, which is named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**2. 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe key to determining the number of NMR signals is to analyze the molecular symmetry of the final product, E.\n\n*   **Structure of E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n    ```\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n          CH₃CH₂   CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has multiple symmetry elements, including a C₂ rotational axis perpendicular to the center of the C=C double bond. This high degree of symmetry makes several carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Identifying Unique Carbons:**\n    1.  **Alkene Carbons (=C<):** The two carbons of the central double bond are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. This results in **one signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl Group Carbons:** The four ethyl groups attached to the double bond are all chemically equivalent. We only need to look at the carbons within one ethyl group.\n        *   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The four methylene carbons are all in identical chemical environments. This results in **one signal**.\n        *   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** The four terminal methyl carbons are also all in identical chemical environments. This results in **one signal**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Summing up the unique environments gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence produces 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene. Due to its high symmetry, this molecule has only three unique types of carbon atoms, leading to 3 signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA) 6\nB) 11\nC) 3\nD) 8\n\nThe calculated number of signals is 3, which corresponds to option C.
