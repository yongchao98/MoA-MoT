Identify the Chemical Principles**\nIn a solution with a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`), a series of complexes will form in equilibrium. The distribution of these species depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (βn) for each complex. The mole fraction (αn) of a particular species `[Co(SCN)n]` can be calculated, and this fraction corresponds to its percentage contribution.\n\n**3. The Formula for Mole Fraction**\nThe fraction of the `n`-th complex, `αₙ`, is given by the formula:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\nwhere:\n*   `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the `n`-th complex.\n*   `[L]` is the concentration of the free ligand.\n*   The sum `Σ` in the denominator is taken over all possible complexes (from `i=1` to the maximum coordination number, which is 4 in this case).\n*   The `1` in the denominator represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which `β₀` is defined as 1).\n\n**4. Applying the Formula to the Specific Problem**\nWe need to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate `α₂` and multiply by 100.\n*   Target complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]` (so, `n=2`)\n*   Ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M. Since this is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately 0.1 M.\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`.\n\nThe formula for `α₂` is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Performing the Calculation**\nLet's calculate the value of each term:\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for free `Co²⁺` (`β₀`): 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (`β₁`): `9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (`β₂`): `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (`β₃`): `63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (`β₄`): `16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate α₂**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. All the provided candidate answers perform this calculation correctly and arrive at the same numerical result.

This is known as the mole fraction (or distribution coefficient) `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Species and Equilibria**\nIn the solution, the cobalt(II) ion `Co²⁺` forms a series of complexes with the thiocyanate ligand `SCN⁻`. The species are:\n*   Free ion: `Co²⁺`\n*   Complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the given overall stability constants (`β`).\n\n**3. Derive the Calculation Formula**\nThe mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, `α₂`, is given by the formula:\n`α₂ = [Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]] / [Total concentration of all cobalt species]`\n\nThis can be expressed using the stability constants (`β_n`) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nA key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` cancels out of the mole fraction calculation. The result depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Ligand concentration: `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M. (This is a valid approximation of the free ligand concentration because the total ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration).\n*   Stability constants: `β₁`=9, `β₂`=40, `β₃`=63, `β₄`=16.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**: `1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    *   `1`\n    *   `9 × (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   `40 × (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo convert this fraction to a percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**5.

Comparing this to the given options:\n*   **A) 16.9%**\n*   B) 38.1%\n*   C) 25.6%\n*   D) 42.3%\n\nThe calculation directly corresponds to option A. The majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, but several failed to map the result to the correct letter option. The consensus on the numerical result and the re-calculation above confirm that 16.9% is the correct value.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires calculating the mole fraction of a specific complex in a solution containing a metal ion and a ligand, given the overall stability constants.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species.\n\n2.  **Define Species and Equilibria**: The cobalt(II) ions `(Co²⁺)` and thiocyanate ions `(SCN⁻)` form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction (αₙ)**: The percentage of any species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction `α₂` for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Using the overall stability constants (`βₙ`), this formula can be rewritten in a way that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the constants themselves:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    *A crucial point is that the total concentration of cobalt (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) is not needed for this calculation, as it cancels out.

This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this species (denoted as `α₂`) and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **Define Species and Equilibria:** The species containing cobalt are `Co²⁺` (free ion) and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`. The formation of these is governed by the given overall stability constants (`βn`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation:** The mole fraction `α₂` is given by the concentration of the species of interest divided by the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n    The concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants `βn`. When substituted into the mole fraction equation, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leading to the following formula which only depends on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Justify Assumptions:** The problem gives the *total* concentration of thiocyanate as 0.1 M. The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration as being equal to its total concentration. Thus, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n    *   **Calculate the numerator of the α₂ formula:**\n        Numerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Calculate the denominator of the α₂ formula:**\n        The denominator is the sum of terms for each species:\n        Denominator = `1` (for Co²⁺) + `β₁[SCN⁻]` + `β₂[SCN⁻]²` + `β₃[SCN⁻]³` + `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`\n        Denominator = `1` + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n        Denominator = `1` + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n        Denominator = **2.3646**\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction α₂:**\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Convert to percentage:**\n        Percentage = `α₂` * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.

    "This is a problem in coordination chemistry that requires calculating the mole fraction of a specific complex in an equilibrium mixture. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this species, denoted `α₂`, and multiplying by 100.\n\n**2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex `[MLₙ]` (where M is the metal, L is the ligand, and n is the number of ligands) is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nThe sum in the denominator runs over all possible complexes (from `i`=1 to the maximum, `N`). The '1' term represents the free metal ion `M`, for which `β₀` is defined as 1.\n\nFor the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, we calculate all the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺: **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nNow, we sum the denominator:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Total vs. Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), it is a valid and standard assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` with its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n2.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the *relative percentage* of a species. It would be required to find the absolute concentration, but not the fraction.\n3.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: It is crucial to include the term for the free ion (`1`) and the terms for *all* possible complexes (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`) in the denominator to correctly represent the total amount of cobalt species.\n4.  **Matching Result to Options**: After performing the calculation and arriving at the numerical answer (~16.9%), it is essential to match this value correctly to the given multiple-choice options. A review of the candidate answers shows that they all successfully performed the calculation, but the inconsistent final letters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) are due to the options being listed in a different order for each of them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a result of approximately 16.9%. Matching this result to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) 16.9%**\n*   B) 25.6%\n*   C) 42.3%\n*   D) 38.1%\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Chemical Principles**\nIn a solution with a metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and a ligand (`SCN⁻`), a series of complexes will form in equilibrium. The distribution of these species depends on the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (βn) for each complex. The mole fraction (αn) of a particular species `[Co(SCN)n]` can be calculated, and this fraction corresponds to its percentage contribution.\n\n**3. The Formula for Mole Fraction**\nThe fraction of the `n`-th complex, `αₙ`, is given by the formula:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))`\nwhere:\n*   `βₙ` is the overall stability constant for the `n`-th complex.\n*   `[L]` is the concentration of the free ligand.\n*   The sum `Σ` in the denominator is taken over all possible complexes (from `i=1` to the maximum coordination number, which is 4 in this case).\n*   The `1` in the denominator represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which `β₀` is defined as 1).\n\n**4. Applying the Formula to the Specific Problem**\nWe need to find the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, so we need to calculate `α₂` and multiply by 100.\n*   Target complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]` (so, `n=2`)\n*   Ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M. Since this is in 10-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately 0.1 M.\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`.\n\nThe formula for `α₂` is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Performing the Calculation**\nLet's calculate the value of each term:\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for free `Co²⁺` (`β₀`): 1\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (`β₁`): `9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (`β₂`): `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (`β₃`): `63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (`β₄`): `16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum of Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate α₂**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. All the provided candidate answers perform this calculation correctly and arrive at the same numerical result.

This is known as the mole fraction (or distribution coefficient) `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2.

Derive the Calculation Formula**\nThe mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, `α₂`, is given by the formula:\n`α₂ = [Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]] / [Total concentration of all cobalt species]`\n\nThis can be expressed using the stability constants (`β_n`) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nA key point, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` cancels out of the mole fraction calculation.

The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` out of the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. This is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, multiplied by 100.\n\n2.  **Identify All Species:** The cobalt in the solution exists as a mixture of the free ion and its complexes: `Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:** The fraction of the n-th complex (`αₙ`) is determined by the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (`βₙ`).

The formula becomes:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    The percentage is `α₂ * 100`.\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   Ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** The term for the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`.\n        `Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:** The denominator is the sum of terms for all possible species.\n        *   For `Co²⁺` (free ion): `1`\n        *   For `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n        *   For `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n        *   For `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n        *   For `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Fraction and Percentage:**\n    *   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    *   Percentage = `α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n8.  **Match with Options:** The calculated value is approximately `16.9%`.

The correct calculation unequivocally points to 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of this species (denoted as `α₂`) and multiplying by 100.\n\n2.  **Define Species and Equilibria:** The species containing cobalt are `Co²⁺` (free ion) and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`. The formation of these is governed by the given overall stability constants (`βn`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation:** The mole fraction `α₂` is given by the concentration of the species of interest divided by the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n    The concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants `βn`. When substituted into the mole fraction equation, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leading to the following formula which only depends on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Justify Assumptions:** The problem gives the *total* concentration of thiocyanate as 0.1 M. The formula requires the *free* (equilibrium) concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration as being equal to its total concentration.

Their formation is governed by the overall stability constants `β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`, and `β₄`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction (α):** The percentage of a species is its mole fraction (α) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction `α₂` for `[Co(SCN)₂]` is defined as:\n    α₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` / `c(Co)`\n    where `c(Co)` is the total concentration of all cobalt species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n4.  **Derive the Calculation Formula:** By expressing the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants (`βₙ`), the `[Co²⁺]` term can be factored out and cancelled. This leads to a formula for the mole fraction that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Assumption on Ligand Concentration:** The total concentration of thiocyanate (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of cobalt (10⁻² M or 0.01 M). Therefore, it is a valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with the initial total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Given values: `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M, `β₁`=9, `β₂`=40, `β₃`=63, `β₄`=16.\n    *   **Calculate the numerator:**\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   **Calculate the denominator:**\n        Denominator = 1 + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n        Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n        Denominator = 2.3646\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction:**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Convert to percentage:**\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately 16.9%.\n    Looking at the given options:\n    A) 42.3%\n    B) 25.6%\n    C) 16.9%\n    D) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option C.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidate Answers:**\nAll candidate answers correctly derived the formula and performed the numerical calculation, arriving at a result of ~16.9%. The discrepancies in their final answers (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, `<<<D>>>`) arose from an error in mapping their correct numerical result to the correct option letter. The correct calculation leads directly to the value in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a problem in coordination chemistry, specifically regarding the distribution of species in a complexation equilibrium. The goal is to calculate the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of cobalt in the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the system and species:** The solution contains a central metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻). They form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species `c(Co)` is the sum of the free ion `[Co²⁺]` and all these complexes.\n\n2.  **Use the mole fraction formula:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (denoted as α_n for the n-th complex) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction `α₂` for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by the formula:\n\n    α₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n3.  **Express in terms of stability constants (β):** Using the definitions of overall stability constants, the formula for the mole fraction can be derived in a way that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the stability constants `β_n`. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, which means the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation. The formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   Ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. (This is a valid approximation for the free ligand concentration because the total ligand concentration is in 10-fold excess of the total metal concentration).\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): **1**\n        Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = **0.9**\n        Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n        Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the mole fraction α₂**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Convert to percentage**:\n        Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** The calculated value of ~16.9% matches option B. All the provided candidate answers perform this calculation correctly, even though some of them mismatch the final calculated value with the correct option letter. The chemical reasoning and mathematical result are unanimous.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct answer, I will systematically perform the calculation based on the principles of coordination chemistry, as outlined by the candidate agents.\n\n**1. Define the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Formulate the Relevant Equation**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex species, `[MLₙ]`, in a solution is denoted by the mole fraction `αₙ`. It is calculated using the concentrations of the free ligand `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The total metal concentration is not required for calculating the relative percentage, as it cancels out.\n\nThe formula for the mole fraction of the nth complex is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ * [L]ⁱ))` for `i` from 1 to the maximum coordination number.\n\nFor the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Identify and Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate ligand, `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. (This is a valid approximation as the ligand is in 10-fold excess of the metal ion, `0.1 M >> 10⁻² M`).\n*   Stability constants:\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's calculate each term in the formula.\n\n*   **Numerator:**\n    *   `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1` (for the free `Co²⁺` ion)\n    *   `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, sum the terms in the denominator:\n*   `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n*   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**5. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo express the fraction as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n*   `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated value matches option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all performed the calculation correctly to arrive at ~16.9%, many selected the incorrect letter. The calculation itself is sound and points unequivocally to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
