The task is to identify a high-yield synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Target Molecule Analysis**\n\n*   **Structure:** The target is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is difficult to achieve. The directing effects of the groups often conflict or favor other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4). The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step must be efficient and highly regioselective, disfavoring pathways that rely on separating minor isomers.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Synthetic Strategies**\n\nTwo main strategies are presented across the various analyses:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: The \"Blocking Group\" Strategy.** This involves using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to block the sterically-favored para position, forcing subsequent substitutions ortho to the tert-butyl group. This is an excellent high-yield strategy in principle.\n    *   Path: `Benzene -> t-Butylbenzene -> 4-tBu-benzenesulfonic acid -> 4-tBu-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Flaw:** As several analyses correctly show, this strategy establishes a 1,2,4-relationship between the functional groups (e.g., tBu at C1, NO2 at C2, SO3H at C4). Subsequent modifications will preserve this 1,2,4-pattern, leading to isomers of the final product, but not the target 1,2,3-isomer. Therefore, this strategy, while high-yield, is incorrect for producing the specified target molecule. Options based primarily on this strategy (like B) are flawed.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The \"Direct Path\".** This strategy involves sequential substitutions without a blocking group. The most logical pathway is outlined in several analyses and matches the sequence of reactions listed in Option D.\n    *   **Path for Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr` (ignoring the superfluous final two steps).\n    *   **Step-by-step Trace:**\n        1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (This is the **major** product, making the step high-yield).\n        3.  **Reduction:** -> 4-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  **Nitration:** -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline (The directing effects of the -tBu and protonated amine group are cooperative, making this step high-yield).\n        5.  **Diazotization:** -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt.\n        6.  **Hydrolysis:** -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\n        7.  **Etherification:** -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This path describes a sequence of chemically sound, high-yield reactions. However, it produces a 1,2,4-isomer, not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n**3. Reconciliation and Final Decision**\n\nWe are faced with a classic dilemma in multiple-choice chemistry problems:\n*   Options A, B, and C contain sequences that are chemically impossible or nonsensical as written (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring/aniline, diazotization without an amine, nitrating an unstable diazonium salt).\n*   Option D outlines a sequence that is chemically valid, logical, and adheres to the \"high-yield\" principle. Its only flaw is that it produces an isomer of the target molecule.\n\nThe existence of a pathway that *could* lead to the correct molecule exists (Strategy 2, but starting with the *minor ortho* isomer from step 2). However, this would violate the \"high-yield\" condition and is not explicitly represented as an option.\n\nThe most rational conclusion is that the question contains a flaw, most likely a typo in the name of the target molecule. Given the choice between selecting an impossible chemical sequence or a perfectly valid sequence that makes a closely related product, the latter is the far more likely intended answer. The question likely meant to ask for the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the best answer as it represents the only chemically sound, high-yield synthesis described among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best answer among the candidates.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Core Chemical Problem\n\nThe goal is the \"high-yield synthesis\" of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Target Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: `-OEt` at C1, `-tBu` at C2, and `-NO2` at C3. This is a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The directing effects of these groups conflict, making a simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions unlikely to produce this specific isomer in high yield. The bulky `-tBu` group favors para-substitution, while the `-OEt` is also a strong o,p-director. Achieving substitution at the sterically hindered C3 position relative to C1 and C2 requires a carefully controlled strategy.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Criterion:** This strongly suggests that any pathway relying on the separation of a minor isomer from a mixture (like isolating *ortho*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene from a direct nitration) is not the correct answer. The synthesis must involve steps that are highly regioselective.\n\n### 2. Identification of the Best Synthetic Strategy\n\nTo control regioselectivity, especially when forming crowded ortho relationships, a **blocking group** strategy is the standard and most powerful tool in organic synthesis. The presence of `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation) and `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) in the reagent lists is the strongest clue that this strategy is intended.\n\nA valid, high-yield strategy would be:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to get tert-butylbenzene. `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Blocking:** Use sulfonation to block the sterically accessible and electronically favored *para* position. `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n3.  **Controlled Nitration:** Now perform nitration. Both the `-tBu` group (directs *ortho*) and the `-SO3H` group (directs *meta*) direct the incoming `-NO2` group to the same position, C2. This gives `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid` in high yield. This establishes the critical *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAny option that does not begin with this logical, high-yield sequence is strategically inferior.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Provided Options\n\nLet's examine the initial steps of each option as listed in the prompt:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This is a low-yield step for the required ortho-isomer, so it fails the \"high-yield\" criterion from the beginning.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This has the same flawed, low-yield start as Option A.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3...`\n    This starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine, deactivating the ring. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This option starts with exactly the high-yield, regioselective blocking group strategy outlined in Step 2. It is the only option that presents a valid opening sequence for a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a key intermediate.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWhile the later steps in all the options appear scrambled and contain typos, the initial strategy is the most telling part of the answer. Option D is the only one that begins with a chemically sound and high-yield strategy appropriate for this complex synthesis. The other options start with fundamentally flawed pathways that are either chemically impossible or do not meet the \"high-yield\" requirement. Therefore, the most logical choice is the one that employs the correct strategy from the outset.\n\nThe reasoning in **Answer 9** best reflects this conclusion by correctly identifying that the blocking group strategy is necessary and that Option D uniquely implements this correct initial strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully analyze the target molecule and evaluate the feasibility of each proposed synthetic route.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -OH (its precursor) are strong activating, *ortho, para*-directors.\n    *   -tBu is a bulky, activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   -NH2 (a common intermediate) is a strong activating, *o,p*-director, but its protonated form (-NH3+) in acid is a deactivating, *m*-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is synthetically challenging and often requires a precise sequence of reactions, sometimes including blocking groups or functional group interconversions. The \"high-yield\" requirement is a critical constraint.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option for chemical correctness and plausibility for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) creates nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Even if performed after step (ii) on aniline, the reaction of the basic amine with the AlCl3 catalyst deactivates the ring and leads to poor results. This pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4...` (followed by `viii) Fe/HCl ; iv) NaNO2/HCl...`).\n    *   The sequence as written has a critical flaw: Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino group. The amino group is only formed later in step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible as sequenced.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    *   The initial steps (i, ii, iii) describe a common and high-yield strategy using a sulfonic acid blocking group. However, this strategy, as analyzed in detail, leads to an intermediate where the t-butyl group and nitro group are *meta* to each other, which is not the relationship required for the final product.\n    *   More importantly, step (vi) suggests nitrating a diazonium salt intermediate from step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and reactive intermediates that are not substrates for nitration with `HNO3/H2SO4`.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B contains a chemically nonsensical step.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   Let's trace this path (initially ignoring the superfluous final steps viii and ix):\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene →** This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To reach the target, we must use the minor **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho) product. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction)\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline →** This is the key step. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+). We have directors -NH3+ (at C1, meta-directing) and -tBu (at C2, ortho,para-directing). The -NH3+ directs incoming electrophiles to C3. While the -tBu group doesn't favor this, this is the only plausible route among the options to introduce a group at C3 and create the 1,2,3-pattern. The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.** (Hydrolysis)\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol →** Williamson ether synthesis yields the final product. Let's name it according to IUPAC rules: the ether is the principal group (C1), making the name **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence successfully produces the target molecule. While its claim to be \"high-yield\" is questionable due to steps (ii) and (iv), it is the only option that is not invalidated by a chemically impossible reaction or an incorrect strategy. The other options contain fundamental flaws. By elimination, this must be the intended answer.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible reaction orders or use incorrect strategies that fail fundamentally. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that, while not perfectly high-yield, is a plausible pathway to the correct target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be correct, Option A is the only chemically viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct synthetic sequence for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Structure**: The molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Challenge**: This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve with high yield using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The directing effects of the groups often conflict or favor other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns). A successful \"high-yield\" synthesis will require a very careful and deliberate sequence of reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects**:\n    *   **-OEt (and its precursor, -OH)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (intermediate)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Becomes a deactivating *meta*-director when protonated to -NH3+ in strong acid.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will analyze each proposed sequence, eliminating any that contain chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B (Starting with HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> tBuCl...)**: This sequence starts by forming aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and making subsequent EAS impossible or very low-yield. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C (Using a blocking group strategy: tBu -> SO3H2 -> HNO3...)**: This is a powerful strategy, but let's check the regiochemistry.\n    1.  `tBu-benzene -> p-tBu-benzenesulfonic acid`.\n    2.  Nitration of this intermediate: Both the t-butyl group (at C4) and the sulfonic acid group (at C1) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3 relative to -SO3H, C5 relative to -SO3H). The resulting product is `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the t-butyl and nitro groups are **ortho** to each other.\n    3.  This is a good step. However, subsequent conversion of the -SO3H group (at C1) into the -OEt group would lead to a 1,3,4-isomer, not the target 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **Option C leads to the wrong product.**\n\n*   **Option D (Similar to C but jumbled)**: This option is nonsensical as written. For instance, step (iv) attempts diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that has no amino group. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A (tBu -> HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> HNO3 -> NaNO2...)**: This is the only option left. Let's analyze its pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. Standard Friedel-Crafts.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To reach the 1,2,3-target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho isomer** (`1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). This step is a major flaw regarding the \"high-yield\" requirement, but let's continue, as other options are impossible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine → **2-tert-butylaniline**. Standard.\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. Under strong acidic conditions, the amino group (-NH2) at C1 is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. It directs the incoming nitro group to position C3. While the t-butyl group at C2 directs elsewhere, the directing effect of the anilinium ion allows for the formation of the required `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. This establishes the key 1,2,3-arrangement.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group. Standard.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → `3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`. Standard.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol into the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Standard.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of transformations described in steps (i) through (vii) of Option A is a chemically valid pathway to synthesize the target molecule. Its primary weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration in step (ii). However, all other options (B, C, D) contain steps that are chemically impossible or lead definitively to the wrong isomer. In the context of selecting the best possible answer from a given list, a path that has a low-yield step is preferable to paths that are impossible. The additional steps (viii and ix) in Option A are superfluous and act as distractors. Therefore, Option A is the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem asks to identify the correct high-yield reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. Such patterns are often challenging to create via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*.\n\n**2. Core Synthetic Challenge and Strategy**\n\nThe \"high-yield\" requirement is critical. Standard reaction sequences often produce mixtures of isomers, violating this condition.\n*   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces mostly the para-isomer, with the required ortho-isomer as a minor product. Any synthetic path relying on this step is not \"high-yield.\"\n*   The final product is extremely sterically congested.\n*   The synthesis must carefully control the regiochemistry. The most powerful tool for this among the given reagents is the use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a **removable blocking group**. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly suggests this strategy is intended.\n\n**3. Evaluating the \"Blocking Group\" Strategy**\n\nA sound, high-yield strategy to create an *ortho* relationship between a tert-butyl group and a nitro group is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.**\n    `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene`\n    This adds the tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).**\n    `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, but sterically favors substitution at the *para* position. This step effectively \"blocks\" the most reactive para position.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    Nitration now occurs on the blocked ring.\n    *   The -tBu group at C4 directs *ortho* (to C3).\n    *   The -SO3H group at C1 directs *meta* (to C3).\n    *   The directing effects are **concordant**, forcing nitration to occur specifically at the C3 position. This produces an intermediate where the -tBu and -NO2 groups are **ortho** to each other, which is a key structural feature of the final product. This initial sequence is the only method presented across the options that can achieve this crucial ortho relationship in high yield.\n\n**4. Analysis of the Options based on the Correct Strategy**\n\nThe options provided appear to be permutations of a similar set of reagents, with many having syntactically impossible ordering. The critical distinction is which option includes the necessary reagents and, most importantly, the correct initial strategy. The blocking group strategy identified above is the only one that satisfies the \"high-yield\" criterion for setting up the required ortho-tert-butyl-nitro intermediate.\n\nWhile the exact ordering of the subsequent steps in all options is convoluted (likely due to typos in the question), a logical pathway can be constructed using the provided reagents to convert the intermediate (`3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`) into the final product. This would involve a complex series of steps like reduction of the nitro group, diazotization to form a phenol, a second nitration, and final removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group and etherification. The key is that the initial steps must follow the blocking group logic.\n\n*   **Option A** is the only one analyzed by the candidate agents that contains the full set of reagents required for the most sophisticated and plausible pathway, including two nitrations and the blocking/deblocking pair (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`).\n*   **Option C (as per Agent 2)** follows a low-yield pathway.\n*   **The path in Option B (as per Agent 7)** also relies on a low-yield step. The alternative high-yield path leads to the wrong isomer.\n*   Options involving direct para-nitration (analyzed by Agents 12 and 14) are high-yield but lead to the wrong isomer (1,2,4 substitution pattern), suggesting a typo in the question's target molecule name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the goal of a **high-yield** synthesis of a complex **1,2,3-isomer**, the most chemically sound approach among the options is the one that utilizes a blocking group to control the initial regiochemistry. While the subsequent steps in the written options are disordered, Option A provides the correct set of reagents and is based on the most plausible high-yield strategy for establishing the difficult ortho-tert-butyl-nitro arrangement. It is the most chemically rigorous pathway when considering the \"high-yield\" constraint.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n- **Parent**: Benzene ring\n- **Substituents**:\n    - C1: Ethoxy (`-OEt`), a strong activating, ortho/para-director.\n    - C2: tert-Butyl (`-tBu`), a moderately activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n    - C3: Nitro (`-NO2`), a strong deactivating, meta-director.\n- **Substitution Pattern**: 1,2,3 (vicinal). This pattern is often challenging to achieve with high yield due to competing electronic effects and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Identify Key Strategic Steps from the Reagents\nThe options include reagents for standard transformations:\n- **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation** (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`): Adds the -tBu group. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) or complexes with basic groups (like aniline).\n- **Nitration** (`HNO3/H2SO4`): Adds the -NO2 group.\n- **Sulfonation & Desulfonation** (`SO3/H2SO4` & `dilute H2SO4`): Suggests the use of the `-SO3H` group as a removable \"blocking group\" to control substitution positions.\n- **Functional Group Interconversion**: A standard sequence is provided to convert one group to another: `Fe/HCl` (reduces `-NO2` to `-NH2`), `NaNO2/HCl` (converts `-NH2` to a diazonium salt `-N2+`), and `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolyzes `-N2+` to `-OH`).\n- **Ether Synthesis** (`NaOH/EtBr`): Converts an `-OH` group to the final `-OEt` group (Williamson ether synthesis).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Pathways\n\nLet's evaluate the primary strategies discussed in the candidate answers. Many agents note that the options are likely flawed or contain typos, so the core chemical strategy is more important than the exact lettering.\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene.**\n- This path starts with `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> ...`\n- The first nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) because of the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. A high-yield synthesis must utilize this major isomer.\n- As analyzed by several agents (e.g., Candidate 12), following this pathway leads cleanly to a 1,2,4-substituted product (`1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`), not the required 1,2,3 product.\n- **Conclusion**: This is a valid, high-yield synthesis, but for the wrong molecule. If the question had a typo in the target name, this would be the answer.\n\n**Strategy 2: Blocking Group Strategy**\n- This path involves `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> (Sulfonation to block para) -> (Nitration ortho) ...`\n- As several agents correctly analyzed, this is a powerful strategy to control regiochemistry. The sequence `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` successfully establishes the necessary *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n- However, completing the synthesis from this intermediate to the 1,2,3 product is extraordinarily complex. Candidate 8 heroically attempts to outline such a path, but it relies on several questionable assumptions about regioselectivity in later steps. It's unlikely to be the intended \"high-yield\" path.\n\n**Strategy 3: The \"Ortho-Nitration\" Path**\nThis strategy is the most plausible route to the correct product, despite one significant flaw. It is outlined with good reasoning by **Candidate 3**.\n- **Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard)\n- **Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This is the crucial step. This is the *minor* product of the reaction. This step is inherently **not high-yield**, which contradicts the premise of the question. However, if we are forced to find a path to the correct product, we must proceed with this isomer.\n- **Step iii: Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction)\n- **Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key regiochemical step to establish the 1,2,3 pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (`-NH3+`), which is a *meta*-director.\n    - The `-NH3+` group at C1 directs the new nitro group to position C3.\n    - The `-tBu` group at C2 directs ortho to itself, which is also position C3.\n    - **The directors are cooperative!** They both direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a plausible, regioselective step.\n- **Step v: NaNO2/HCl -> Diazonium salt.** (Standard)\n- **Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.** (Standard hydrolysis)\n- **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** (Standard ether synthesis). The final product is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Of all the proposed pathways, **Strategy 3 (the \"Ortho-Nitration\" path)** is the only one that can be logically argued to produce the correct 1,2,3-substituted isomer.\n- Its main weakness is that the first step (the ortho-nitration) is not high-yield. However, all subsequent steps, particularly the key nitration of the aniline derivative, are plausible and regioselective.\n- Other strategies either lead definitively to the wrong isomer (Strategy 1) or are convoluted and unlikely to be the intended answer (Strategy 2).\n- Given the options, the question is likely flawed by asking for a \"high-yield\" synthesis via a path that contains one low-yield step. But among the choices, this path is the only one that reaches the stated destination.\n- The reagents and reaction order described in Strategy 3 are perfectly matched by the sequence presented in **Option A** by candidates 3 and 10. The extra steps at the end of that option are superfluous distractors.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the only chemically plausible (though imperfect) sequence to synthesize the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically hindered and electronically challenging to achieve via simple electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The synthesis must involve a carefully planned sequence, likely utilizing functional group conversions or blocking groups to control regiochemistry. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step proceeds with high regioselectivity and efficiency.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to check for chemical validity and efficiency.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step i) and ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n*   Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is highly problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is not high-yield and gives a mixture of products, primarily the meta isomer. This route fails the \"high-yield\" criteria.\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n*   This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group.\n*   Step iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The intermediate produced after step iii) (sulfonation of a nitro-compound) does not contain an amino group.\n*   Therefore, the sequence contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   This sequence forms an intermediate that is then treated with `NaNO2/HCl` (step v) to form a diazonium salt.\n*   Step vi) then suggests treating this diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This is not a standard or safe reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they are typically used in Sandmeyer or similar reactions, not as substrates for nitration.\n*   Therefore, this sequence contains a nonsensical step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\nLet's analyze the core of this sequence (steps i-vii), as steps viii and ix (sulfonation followed by desulfonation) are superfluous at the end. There are two possible interpretations of this path:\n\n1.  **Path to the Correct Isomer (low yield):**\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration → **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is the *minor* product; the para isomer is major. This step violates the \"high-yield\" condition from the start.\n    *   iii) Reduction → 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   iv) Second nitration → Plausibly forms 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline, but with regioselectivity issues.\n    *   v-vii) Conversion of the amino group to the ethoxy group. This sequence *can* form the target molecule but is not high-yield.\n\n2.  **Path Following the Major Isomer (high yield):**\n    This is the more likely interpretation for a \"high-yield\" problem, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (High-yield).\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. (High-yield major product).\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl` → **4-tert-butylaniline**. (High-yield).\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. In strong acid, the amine is protonated (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Both direct to position 2. This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` → **Diazonium salt**. (High-yield).\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. (High-yield).\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (High-yield).\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) describes a robust, high-yield synthesis of a **1,2,4-substituted isomer**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options B and D contain chemically impossible steps.\n*   Option C contains a problematic, low-yield step.\n*   Option A, when following the major products at each stage, describes a logical, high-yield synthesis of a specific isomer of the target product (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). The final two steps are distractors.\n\nIn the context of multiple-choice questions involving complex synthesis, it is common for there to be a typo in the target molecule's name. Given that sequence A (steps i-vii) is the only pathway presented that constitutes a valid, high-yield synthesis, it is the most plausible intended answer, with the assumption that the target was meant to be the 1,2,4-isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem asks for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This requires careful analysis of the target molecule's structure and the chemical validity of the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The target is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -tBu groups are *ortho* to each other. The -tBu and -NO2 groups are also *ortho* to each other. Critically, the strongly activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO2 group are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** Achieving this 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially the *meta* relationship between a strong activator and a deactivator, is not straightforward via direct electrophilic substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving functional group conversions or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for chemical feasibility and whether it can produce the target in \"high-yield\".\n\n*   **Option B and C (and any path using the initial `tBu -> SO3H -> NO2` strategy):**\n    *   Some agents propose a blocking group strategy: i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to get tert-butylbenzene, ii) Sulfonation to get 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position), iii) Nitration.\n    *   This sequence is a valid high-yield strategy. However, let's analyze the product of step (iii). On 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, both the -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   In this key intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this entire strategic path leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be correct. Options B and C, which rely on variations of this or other flawed strategies (like Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated aniline derivative), are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   As analyzed by several agents, option D, if re-ordered into a plausible synthesis, describes a robust, high-yield pathway to a structural isomer. The sequence: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butylaniline -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline -> ...` ultimately produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   This is a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the requested 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   Let's analyze the sequence presented in option A (based on the clearest versions from the candidate answers): `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ;` plus some superfluous steps.\n    *   Let's trace this path step-by-step:\n        1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 ->` **tert-Butylbenzene**\n        2.  `ii) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 ->` The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to steric preference. A high-yield synthesis must use the major product.\n        3.  `iii) ... + Fe/HCl ->` Reduction of the nitro group gives **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        4.  `iv) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 ->` Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects of the t-butyl group and the (protonated) amino group are synergistic, leading to nitration *ortho* to the amino group. This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        5.  `v) ... + NaNO2/HCl ->` Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n        6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat ->` Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr ->` Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ether.\n    *   **Product:** The sequence produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,4-isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the proposed options lead to chemically impossible steps, fundamentally incorrect isomers, or rely on very low-yield reactions, violating the \"high-yield\" criterion.\n*   Options B and C are incorrect because their core strategy generates the wrong isomer (meta tBu/NO2).\n*   Options A and D both describe coherent, high-yield syntheses of the *same* **1,2,4-isomer** (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`).\n\nGiven the choices, it is extremely likely that the question contains a typo in the name of the target molecule and was intended to ask for the 1,2,4-isomer. Since the sequence of reactions described in option A is chemically sound, high-yield, and represents a standard textbook synthesis pathway (alkylation -> para-nitration -> reduction -> ortho-nitration -> diazotization/hydrolysis -> etherification), it is the most plausible intended answer. The superfluous final steps are distractors. Option A is the best answer because it represents the most logical and viable chemical synthesis among the choices, despite the discrepancy with the named product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis question asks for the correct high-yield synthetic sequence to produce **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This is a complex synthesis problem requiring a careful analysis of substituent directing effects and reaction ordering.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *o,p*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *o,p*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *m*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -tBu and -NO2 groups are *ortho* to each other. The -OEt and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Implication:** The *meta* relationship between the strongly *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is a significant clue. It strongly suggests that the nitration that installed the C3-nitro group did not happen on a ring already containing the ethoxy group (or its precursor, the hydroxyl group). A functional group transformation must be involved.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Plausible High-Yield Strategy\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring in high yield often requires a **blocking group** strategy to control regiochemistry. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options confirms that this is the likely intended path.\n\nA full, chemically sound synthesis can be proposed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Introduce the bulky -tBu group first.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** Block the sterically favored *para* position with a sulfonic acid group. This group can be removed later.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n3.  **First Nitration:** Now, nitrate the ring. Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (*m*-director) will direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, C2 (relative to the tBu group), creating the crucial *ortho* relationship between tBu and the first NO2.\n    *   Intermediate → **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n4.  **Second Nitration:** To introduce the final nitro group, a second nitration is needed. All existing groups (-SO3H, -tBu, -NO2) cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile to the same position, C5.\n    *   Intermediate → **3,5-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n5.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups must be converted to an amino group to later become the ethoxy group. The nitro group at C5 is less sterically hindered than the one at C3 (next to the bulky tBu). A reducing agent like `Fe/HCl` will selectively reduce the C5 nitro group.\n    *   Intermediate → **5-amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n6.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** The sulfonic acid has served its purpose and can now be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Intermediate → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** (the ring renumbers around the amine)\n\n7.  **Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, which is an excellent leaving group.\n    *   Intermediate + `NaNO2/HCl` → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**\n\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol by warming in an aqueous acid solution.\n    *   Intermediate + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    *   Intermediate + `NaOH/EtBr` → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n\nThis complex but logical pathway is the only one that can produce the target molecule in high yield. Now, we must check which option provides the necessary **set of reagents** for this synthesis. The order of steps in the given options is often scrambled or contains typos in this type of question.\n\nLet's check the list of reagents required by our proposed synthesis:\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n*   `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation)\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (two times)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (reduction)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis)\n*   `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (etherification)\n\nNow let's examine the reagent pool provided in **Option C**:\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` (second nitration reagent provided)\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`\n*   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation reagent provided)\n*   ix) `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation reagent provided)\n\nAlthough the sequence as written in Option C is not in the correct chemical order, it is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents to carry out the plausible, high-yield synthesis described above. The other options are flawed either by containing impossible reaction steps (e.g., diazotizing without an amine) or by following a path that logically leads to an incorrect isomer in high yield.\n\nTherefore, Option C represents the correct collection of reagents needed for the synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires us to identify the most efficient, high-yield synthetic pathway to a specific trisubstituted benzene derivative from a list of options. The target molecule's structure is key to solving this.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3- (or vicinal) substitution pattern. These are often difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Key Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, favoring *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Synthetic Options\n\nThe core of this problem is to evaluate which reaction sequence is chemically logical and abides by the \"high-yield\" constraint. Let's systematically analyze the strategies presented in the options.\n\n*   **Strategies starting with Nitration (Option C in some agent versions):** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3...` This pathway is fundamentally flawed. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction does not work efficiently, as the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. This is not a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Strategies starting with Blocking Groups (Option B/C/D in various agent versions):** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...` This is a common and powerful strategy.\n    1.  Benzene is converted to `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  The para position is blocked by sulfonation, giving `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    3.  Nitration now occurs *ortho* to the t-butyl group, giving `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    In this key intermediate, the t-butyl group and the nitro group are **meta** (1,3) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho** (1,2). Therefore, this otherwise excellent strategy leads to the wrong isomeric relationship for the target molecule.\n\n*   **Strategies starting with Direct Nitration of tert-Butylbenzene (Option C in the canonical version):**\n    `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    Let's trace this path, which is the most promising among the options.\n    1.  **Step i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene -> `tert-Butylbenzene`. This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n    2.  **Step ii) Nitration:** The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position. The major product, formed in high yield, is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n    3.  **Step iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group with `Fe/HCl`, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a high-yield step.\n    4.  **Step iv) Nitration:** We nitrate `4-tert-butylaniline`. To achieve a high yield and prevent oxidation, the amino group is usually protected as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3). The protected amide group is a very strong *ortho*-director. The t-butyl group also directs *ortho*. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (ortho to the amide, meta to the t-butyl). This step gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** in high yield (after deprotection).\n    5.  **Step v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`.\n    6.  **Step vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol using `H3O+/Heat`. This yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    7.  **Step vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the ethoxy ether with `NaOH/EtBr`, giving the final product.\n\n### 3. Conclusion: The Typo Hypothesis\n\nThe product of this logical, high-yield synthesis is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the 1,2,3-isomer requested in the prompt (`2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`).\n\nThis leads to the most reasonable conclusion: The question contains a typo in the name of the target molecule. The chemical sequence that is most sound, and adheres to the \"high-yield\" constraint, is the one that leads to the 1,2,4-isomer.\n\nOption C presents this exact sequence in its first seven steps. The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are nonsensical distractors added to the end of an otherwise correct synthesis. By comparing the options, this pathway is the only one that represents a coherent and efficient multi-step synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure of the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (`-OEt`), a tert-butyl group (`-tBu`), and a nitro group (`-NO2`).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions C1, C2, and C3, respectively. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (or vicinal) pattern.\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Formulate a High-Yield Strategy\n\nSynthesizing a sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer in \"high-yield\" is a significant challenge. Direct, sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is unlikely to work.\n*   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces mainly the *para* isomer due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group. To proceed, one would need to isolate the minor *ortho* product, which violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n*   A key feature is the *meta* relationship between the strongly *ortho, para*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This strongly suggests that the nitro group was introduced to the ring *before* the final ethoxy group was present in its activating form.\n\nThe most effective strategy to overcome unfavorable regiochemistry in EAS is to use a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) is ideal for this because it's a *meta*-director that can be added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options based on Strategy\n\nLet's look for an option that employs a correct blocking group strategy. The correct strategy to force ortho substitution on tert-butylbenzene is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Introduce the -tBu group.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** Block the sterically favored *para* position with `-SO3H`.\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, nitration will be directed to the *ortho* position.\n\nNow we evaluate the initial steps of each option:\n*   **Option A:** `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Sulfonation`. This sequence doesn't use sulfonation as a blocking step; it just adds a sulfonic acid group to an already nitrated molecule. This is not the correct strategy.\n*   **Option B:** `Nitration -> Reduction -> Alkylation`. This is flawed. Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails or is very low-yield on the aniline formed in step (ii).\n*   **Option C:** `Alkylation -> Sulfonation -> Nitration`. This sequence perfectly matches the high-yield blocking group strategy described above. Let's trace these first three steps:\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (The para position is blocked).\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The `-tBu` group (at C4) directs ortho, and the `-SO3H` group (at C1) directs meta. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3, which is ortho to -tBu). This cleanly produces **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (or 2-nitro-4-tert-butyl... depending on numbering). Critically, it creates the required **ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups** in high yield.\n\n*   **Option D:** `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction`. This path relies on the direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which, as established, gives the wrong isomer (para) as the major product and thus cannot be a high-yield synthesis for the ortho-substituted starting material required for the target molecule.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   Options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed for a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. They either contain incorrect chemical steps, are not high-yield, or do not lead to the required substitution pattern.\n*   Option C is the only choice that begins with a correct and powerful synthetic strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to achieve the most difficult part of the synthesis: the high-yield formation of the ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement.\n*   While the later steps in Option C (iv through ix) appear to be listed in a nonsensical or scrambled order (a common issue in complex multiple-choice questions), the initial strategic foundation (steps i, ii, iii) is the only one presented that **could lead to** the high-yield synthesis of the specified product.\n\nTherefore, Option C represents the most chemically sound approach.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge**\n\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (-OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, -NO2 at C3). This is a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) on a substituted ring are governed by the directing effects of the existing groups. Achieving a specific, crowded 1,2,3-pattern in high yield is non-trivial and often requires a sophisticated strategy to control where the new groups are added (regiochemistry).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Core Synthetic Strategies in the Options**\n\nA crucial part of the synthesis is establishing the *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option C:** This involves the direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene (`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`).\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. However, due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position. The desired *ortho* isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is only a minor product.\n    *   A synthesis that relies on isolating a minor product cannot be considered \"high-yield.\" Therefore, the strategy in Option C is fundamentally flawed for this requirement.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option B:** This starts with nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`).\n    *   This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. This makes the Friedel-Crafts reaction fail or give very poor yields. This is not a \"high-yield\" route.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option D:** This option contains a chemically impossible step early in its sequence. Step (iv) attempts to use `NaNO2/HCl` (a reagent for converting an amine to a diazonium salt) on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`, a molecule that does not have an amine group. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option A:** This option begins with a classic, powerful strategy for controlling regiochemistry: using a **blocking group**.\n    *   **Step i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   **Step ii) `SO3/H2SO4`**: tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The reaction occurs almost exclusively at the *para* position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n    *   **Step iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: The ring is nitrated. With the para position blocked, the activating t-butyl group can only direct substitution to the *ortho* position. The deactivating -SO3H group also directs *meta* to itself, which is the same *ortho* position. The directing effects are concordant. This leads to a very clean, **high-yield** formation of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the core strategies, the blocking group approach detailed in the first three steps of **Option A** is the only one that can produce the necessary ortho-substituted intermediate in high yield. The other options either rely on a low-yield reaction or contain chemically impossible steps.\n\nWhile the sequence of reactions in the latter half of Option A (specifically step vi, which suggests nitrating an unstable diazonium salt) is chemically flawed, the initial steps (i, ii, and iii) represent the only viable \"high-yield\" strategy presented. In the context of a multiple-choice question with flaws, the correct answer is the one that employs the most correct and powerful chemical principles. The key to this problem is recognizing that the sulfonation/desulfonation blocking group strategy is superior to direct nitration for achieving the desired substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. It is sterically bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The tBu group is *ortho* to both the OEt and the NO2 groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate General Synthetic Strategies**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene is challenging. Two main strategies are typically considered:\n*   **Direct Substitution:** Introduce groups one by one, using their directing effects to control placement. This often leads to isomeric mixtures.\n*   **Blocking Group Strategy:** Temporarily block a reactive position (usually with a sulfonic acid group, -SO3H) to force substitution at a less-favored position. The blocking group is then removed.\n\n**3. Analyze the Options Based on Plausibility**\n\nLet's analyze the two main synthetic routes discussed in the candidate answers.\n\n**Strategy 1: The Blocking Group Approach**\nThis strategy is seen in the reasoning for options A, B, C, and D by various agents. The typical sequence is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** tert-Butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the sulfonic acid group goes to the para position, blocking it).\n3.  **Nitration:** Both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming NO2 group to position 2. This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the tBu group (at C4) and the NO2 group (at C2) are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this entire strategy, while a valid high-yield synthesis, produces the wrong family of isomers and cannot lead to the target molecule. Any option based on this strategy is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy 2: The Direct Sequential Substitution Approach**\nThis strategy is also discussed by many agents, who trace the following sequence of reaction types:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene is nitrated. Due to the steric bulk of the tBu group, this produces a mixture of the *para* isomer (major product, ~70-80%) and the *ortho* isomer (minor product, ~15-20%). To proceed, one must isolate the **minor ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer. This immediately conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine (Fe/HCl), yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **Nitration:** The 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. Under the strong acid conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   On the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming NO2 to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The -tBu group (at C2) directs the incoming NO2 to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The directing effects are **cooperative**, guiding the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is more sterically hindered, but its formation is necessary for the final product. This step can plausibly form the required **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n5.  **Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (NaNO2/HCl).\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (H3O+/Heat).\n7.  **Etherification:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether (NaOH/EtBr).\n\n**Conclusion on Strategies:**\n*   Strategy 1 (Blocking Group) is a high-yield synthesis, but it leads to the wrong isomer.\n*   Strategy 2 (Direct Substitution) is the only pathway discussed that can plausibly form the correct isomer. Its major weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration step. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (if imperfect) route is superior to one that is chemically impossible or leads definitively to the wrong product.\n\nGiven these considerations, Strategy 2 represents the \"best\" answer among the likely choices, assuming the term \"high-yield\" is used loosely to mean the most viable route. The various candidate answers assign this specific sequence to different letters (A, C, or D). However, the analysis in **Answer 2**, which assigns this sequence to option C, is the most clear-headed. It correctly identifies the low-yield step but recognizes it as the only viable path to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe goal is to find the best multi-step synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene.\n\n**1.  Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with substituents at adjacent positions (a 1,2,3-pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The tBu group and the NO2 group are **ortho** (adjacent) to each other.\n    *   The OEt group and the NO2 group are **meta** to each other.\n*   **Director Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho,para-directors (activating).\n    *   -NO2 is a meta-director (deactivating).\n    *   -SO3H (a potential blocking group) is a meta-director.\n\n**2.  Evaluating Key Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe most difficult part of this synthesis is establishing the **ortho relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups**. There are two primary strategies presented in the options to achieve this:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Using a Blocking Group.** This involves first alkylating benzene, then using a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group to \"block\" the sterically favored *para* position, and then nitrating the ring. Let's analyze this path:\n    1.  Benzene + tBuCl -> **t-Butylbenzene**\n    2.  Sulfonation -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C4, SO3H at C1).\n    3.  Nitration -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C4, NO2 at C2, SO3H at C1).\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this intermediate, the tBu group (at C4) and the NO2 group (at C2) are **meta** to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho**. Therefore, this popular blocking group strategy is incorrect for synthesizing this specific target molecule. Any option that relies on this path (like option A) is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Direct Nitration.** This involves nitrating t-butylbenzene directly.\n    1.  Benzene + tBuCl -> **t-Butylbenzene**\n    2.  Nitration -> This gives a mixture of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` (~15-20%) and `para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` (~70-80%).\n    *   To make the target molecule, one must isolate and proceed with the minor **ortho isomer**. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question. However, if other synthetic routes are impossible, this may be the only feasible path.\n\n**3.  Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence `(i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; (ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; (iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...)` follows the flawed blocking group strategy (Strategy 1). It produces an intermediate where the t-butyl and nitro groups are meta, not ortho. Therefore, **Option A cannot produce the target molecule.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence `(i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; (ii) Fe/HCl ; (iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...)` starts by making aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction works poorly or fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **This is not a viable high-yield synthesis.**\n\n*   **Option D:** This option contains typos and scrambled steps (e.g., trying to use `NaNO2/HCl` on a molecule without an amine), making it chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence `(i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; (ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; (iii) Fe/HCl ; (iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` follows the direct nitration approach (Strategy 2). Let's trace the pathway, assuming we carry the necessary intermediate forward.\n    1.  `i)` Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**\n    2.  `ii)` Nitration gives a mixture. We isolate the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (Low yield for this step).\n    3.  `iii)` Reduction of the nitro group -> **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv)` Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Under strong acid conditions, the amine is protonated (-NH3+, a meta-director) and the t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to positions 3 and 5. The desired isomer, **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**, is formed (though likely in a mixture).\n    5.  `v)` Diazotization of the amino group at C1 -> **diazonium salt**.\n    6.  `vi)` Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii)` Williamson ether synthesis -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the correct target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Options A, B, and D are fatally flawed. Option A leads to the wrong isomer. Option B relies on a failed reaction. Option D is incoherent.\n*   Option C describes a chemically logical pathway that leads to the correct final product. Its main weakness is that some steps are not regioselective and thus not \"high-yield\". However, among the given choices, it is the only one that presents a chemically viable sequence of reactions to form the target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question with flawed options, the one that is chemically possible, even if imperfect, is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Challenge\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2) groups are all adjacent to each other.\n*   **The Challenge:** This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve with high yield using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions. This is because the directing effects of the substituents often lead to other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4- or 1,3,5-). For instance:\n    *   Both -OEt and -tBu are ortho-, para- directors.\n    *   The -NO2 group is a meta- director.\n*   The fact that the question specifies a \"high-yield synthesis\" strongly suggests that a simple sequence of direct substitutions will not work. A more complex strategy, likely involving blocking groups and multiple functional group interconversions, is required.\n\n### 2. Propose a Viable High-Yield Synthesis\nA plausible high-yield synthesis for such a sterically hindered and electronically complex target requires precise control of regiochemistry. One advanced but viable pathway proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Start by adding the tert-butyl group. (Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`).\n2.  **Blocking:** Use sulfonation to block the para-position, which is sterically and electronically favored. This forces the next substitution to occur ortho to the tert-butyl group. (`+ SO3/H2SO4`).\n3.  **First Nitration:** Introduce a nitro group. It is directed ortho to the t-Bu group and meta to the -SO3H group, resulting in `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. (`+ HNO3/H2SO4`).\n4.  **Second Nitration:** To achieve the 1,2,3 final pattern, a second nitro group must be added. The existing groups direct this second nitration to position 6 (relative to the tBu at 1 and SO3H at 4), yielding `2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. (`+ HNO3/H2SO4`).\n5.  **Selective Reduction:** Reduce one of the nitro groups to an amine. The nitro group at position 6 is less sterically hindered than the one at position 2 (which is between two groups), so it will be reduced preferentially. (`+ Fe/HCl`). This gives `6-amino-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n6.  **Removal of Blocking Group:** The sulfonic acid group has served its purpose and is now removed via desulfonation. (`+ dilute H2SO4, heat`). This yields `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`, which has the core 1,2,3 arrangement of the required functional groups.\n7.  **Functional Group Conversion:** The amino group needs to be converted into the final ethoxy group. This is a standard three-step process:\n    *   **Diazotization:** Convert the amine to a diazonium salt. (`+ NaNO2/HCl`).\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** Replace the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group to form a phenol. (`+ H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Etherification:** Convert the phenol to an ether. (`+ NaOH/EtBr`).\n\n### 3. Match the Proposed Synthesis to the Options\nNow, we must check which option provides the necessary \"pool\" of reagents to carry out this complex synthesis.\nThe required reagents are:\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (1)\n*   `SO3/H2SO4` (1)\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (2)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (1)\n*   `dilute H2SO4` (1)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (1)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (1)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (1)\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **Option A**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4` ; `ii) Fe/HCl` ; `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` ; `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` ; `v) NaNO2/HCl` ; `vi) SO3/H2SO4` ; `vii) dilute H2SO4` ; `viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat` ; `ix) NaOH/EtBr`.\n    This option contains exactly the right number and type of reagents needed for the viable pathway described above, including the crucial second nitration reagent (`HNO3/H2SO4`).\n*   **Options B, C, D**: Each of these options lists only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step. They do not provide the necessary reagents for the second nitration required to build the correct precursor. Furthermore, they contain other fundamental flaws (e.g., incorrect starting steps, impossible reaction sequences).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWhile the order of reactions listed in Option A is illogical and incorrect as written, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents necessary for a viable, albeit complex, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. In the context of challenging multiple-choice synthesis problems, the correct answer is often the one that contains the necessary \"reagent toolkit,\" even if the listed sequence is flawed. The other options fail because they lack the essential reagents for any plausible route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe molecule to be synthesized is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), an activating *ortho, para*-director that is sterically bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strongly deactivating *meta*-director.\n*   **Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and synthetically difficult. The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis means that any route relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect, and that the sequence of reactions must be highly regioselective.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nWe must eliminate any option that contains a chemically impossible step or uses a fundamentally flawed strategy.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence involves forming nitrobenzene (i), then aniline (ii), and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii). The Friedel-Crafts reaction fails on the deactivated aniline ring because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This option has a fatal flaw in its ordering. Step (iv) is a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino (-NH2) group. However, the substrate after step (iii) (a sulfonated nitro compound) does not have an amino group. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not exist. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This option begins with a classic blocking group strategy.\n    1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    2.  Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position).\n    3.  Nitration -> This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* (1,3 relationship) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho* (1,2 relationship). Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, produces the wrong isomer. Furthermore, later in the sequence (step vi), it attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is nonsensical. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard reaction).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene.** This gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrated products. The para isomer is major. To reach the target, one must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (`1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key step. In strong acid, the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group (at C1) is a meta-director. The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director. The directing effects are cooperative, both pushing the incoming nitro group to position C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This creates the required 1,2,3-pattern.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` →** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the phenol (`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` →** Williamson ether synthesis gives the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The final two steps listed (viii, ix) are superfluous distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps or are based on strategies that definitively lead to the wrong isomers. Option A describes the only sequence that is chemically capable of producing the correct target molecule. Its primary weakness is the non-selective nitration in step (ii), which violates the \"high-yield\" criterion.

The task is to identify a high-yield synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Target Molecule Analysis**\n\n*   **Structure:** The target is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenge:** This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is difficult to achieve. The directing effects of the groups often conflict or favor other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4). The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step must be efficient and highly regioselective, disfavoring pathways that rely on separating minor isomers.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Synthetic Strategies**\n\nTwo main strategies are presented across the various analyses:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: The \"Blocking Group\" Strategy.** This involves using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to block the sterically-favored para position, forcing subsequent substitutions ortho to the tert-butyl group. This is an excellent high-yield strategy in principle.\n    *   Path: `Benzene -> t-Butylbenzene -> 4-tBu-benzenesulfonic acid -> 4-tBu-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Flaw:** As several analyses correctly show, this strategy establishes a 1,2,4-relationship between the functional groups (e.g., tBu at C1, NO2 at C2, SO3H at C4). Subsequent modifications will preserve this 1,2,4-pattern, leading to isomers of the final product, but not the target 1,2,3-isomer. Therefore, this strategy, while high-yield, is incorrect for producing the specified target molecule. Options based primarily on this strategy (like B) are flawed.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The \"Direct Path\".** This strategy involves sequential substitutions without a blocking group. The most logical pathway is outlined in several analyses and matches the sequence of reactions listed in Option D.\n    *   **Path for Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr` (ignoring the superfluous final two steps).\n    *   **Step-by-step Trace:**\n        1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (This is the **major** product, making the step high-yield).\n        3.  **Reduction:** -> 4-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  **Nitration:** -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline (The directing effects of the -tBu and protonated amine group are cooperative, making this step high-yield).\n        5.  **Diazotization:** -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium salt.\n        6.  **Hydrolysis:** -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\n        7.  **Etherification:** -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This path describes a sequence of chemically sound, high-yield reactions. However, it produces a 1,2,4-isomer, not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n**3. Reconciliation and Final Decision**\n\nWe are faced with a classic dilemma in multiple-choice chemistry problems:\n*   Options A, B, and C contain sequences that are chemically impossible or nonsensical as written (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring/aniline, diazotization without an amine, nitrating an unstable diazonium salt).\n*   Option D outlines a sequence that is chemically valid, logical, and adheres to the \"high-yield\" principle. Its only flaw is that it produces an isomer of the target molecule.\n\nThe existence of a pathway that *could* lead to the correct molecule exists (Strategy 2, but starting with the *minor ortho* isomer from step 2). However, this would violate the \"high-yield\" condition and is not explicitly represented as an option.\n\nThe most rational conclusion is that the question contains a flaw, most likely a typo in the name of the target molecule. Given the choice between selecting an impossible chemical sequence or a perfectly valid sequence that makes a closely related product, the latter is the far more likely intended answer. The question likely meant to ask for the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the best answer as it represents the only chemically sound, high-yield synthesis described among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best answer among the candidates.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Core Chemical Problem\n\nThe goal is the \"high-yield synthesis\" of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Target Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: `-OEt` at C1, `-tBu` at C2, and `-NO2` at C3. This is a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The directing effects of these groups conflict, making a simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions unlikely to produce this specific isomer in high yield. The bulky `-tBu` group favors para-substitution, while the `-OEt` is also a strong o,p-director. Achieving substitution at the sterically hindered C3 position relative to C1 and C2 requires a carefully controlled strategy.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Criterion:** This strongly suggests that any pathway relying on the separation of a minor isomer from a mixture (like isolating *ortho*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene from a direct nitration) is not the correct answer. The synthesis must involve steps that are highly regioselective.\n\n### 2. Identification of the Best Synthetic Strategy\n\nTo control regioselectivity, especially when forming crowded ortho relationships, a **blocking group** strategy is the standard and most powerful tool in organic synthesis. The presence of `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation) and `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) in the reagent lists is the strongest clue that this strategy is intended.\n\nA valid, high-yield strategy would be:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to get tert-butylbenzene. `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n2.  **Blocking:** Use sulfonation to block the sterically accessible and electronically favored *para* position. `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n3.  **Controlled Nitration:** Now perform nitration. Both the `-tBu` group (directs *ortho*) and the `-SO3H` group (directs *meta*) direct the incoming `-NO2` group to the same position, C2. This gives `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid` in high yield. This establishes the critical *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAny option that does not begin with this logical, high-yield sequence is strategically inferior.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Provided Options\n\nLet's examine the initial steps of each option as listed in the prompt:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This is a low-yield step for the required ortho-isomer, so it fails the \"high-yield\" criterion from the beginning.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This has the same flawed, low-yield start as Option A.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3...`\n    This starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine, deactivating the ring. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    This option starts with exactly the high-yield, regioselective blocking group strategy outlined in Step 2. It is the only option that presents a valid opening sequence for a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a key intermediate.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWhile the later steps in all the options appear scrambled and contain typos, the initial strategy is the most telling part of the answer. Option D is the only one that begins with a chemically sound and high-yield strategy appropriate for this complex synthesis. The other options start with fundamentally flawed pathways that are either chemically impossible or do not meet the \"high-yield\" requirement. Therefore, the most logical choice is the one that employs the correct strategy from the outset.\n\nThe reasoning in **Answer 9** best reflects this conclusion by correctly identifying that the blocking group strategy is necessary and that Option D uniquely implements this correct initial strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, we must carefully analyze the target molecule and evaluate the feasibility of each proposed synthetic route.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -OH (its precursor) are strong activating, *ortho, para*-directors.\n    *   -tBu is a bulky, activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -NO2 is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   -NH2 (a common intermediate) is a strong activating, *o,p*-director, but its protonated form (-NH3+) in acid is a deactivating, *m*-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is synthetically challenging and often requires a precise sequence of reactions, sometimes including blocking groups or functional group interconversions. The \"high-yield\" requirement is a critical constraint.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option for chemical correctness and plausibility for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) creates nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Even if performed after step (ii) on aniline, the reaction of the basic amine with the AlCl3 catalyst deactivates the ring and leads to poor results. This pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4...` (followed by `viii) Fe/HCl ; iv) NaNO2/HCl...`).\n    *   The sequence as written has a critical flaw: Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino group. The amino group is only formed later in step (viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible as sequenced.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...`\n    *   The initial steps (i, ii, iii) describe a common and high-yield strategy using a sulfonic acid blocking group. However, this strategy, as analyzed in detail, leads to an intermediate where the t-butyl group and nitro group are *meta* to each other, which is not the relationship required for the final product.\n    *   More importantly, step (vi) suggests nitrating a diazonium salt intermediate from step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and reactive intermediates that are not substrates for nitration with `HNO3/H2SO4`.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B contains a chemically nonsensical step.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   Let's trace this path (initially ignoring the superfluous final steps viii and ix):\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene →** This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To reach the target, we must use the minor **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho) product. This step compromises the \"high-yield\" claim but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction)\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline →** This is the key step. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+). We have directors -NH3+ (at C1, meta-directing) and -tBu (at C2, ortho,para-directing). The -NH3+ directs incoming electrophiles to C3. While the -tBu group doesn't favor this, this is the only plausible route among the options to introduce a group at C3 and create the 1,2,3-pattern. The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.** (Hydrolysis)\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol →** Williamson ether synthesis yields the final product. Let's name it according to IUPAC rules: the ether is the principal group (C1), making the name **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence successfully produces the target molecule. While its claim to be \"high-yield\" is questionable due to steps (ii) and (iv), it is the only option that is not invalidated by a chemically impossible reaction or an incorrect strategy. The other options contain fundamental flaws. By elimination, this must be the intended answer.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible reaction orders or use incorrect strategies that fail fundamentally. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that, while not perfectly high-yield, is a plausible pathway to the correct target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be correct, Option A is the only chemically viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct synthetic sequence for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Structure**: The molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Challenge**: This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve with high yield using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The directing effects of the groups often conflict or favor other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns). A successful \"high-yield\" synthesis will require a very careful and deliberate sequence of reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects**:\n    *   **-OEt (and its precursor, -OH)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NH2 (intermediate)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Becomes a deactivating *meta*-director when protonated to -NH3+ in strong acid.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will analyze each proposed sequence, eliminating any that contain chemically impossible or fundamentally flawed steps for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option B (Starting with HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> tBuCl...)**: This sequence starts by forming aniline and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and making subsequent EAS impossible or very low-yield. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C (Using a blocking group strategy: tBu -> SO3H2 -> HNO3...)**: This is a powerful strategy, but let's check the regiochemistry.\n    1.  `tBu-benzene -> p-tBu-benzenesulfonic acid`.\n    2.  Nitration of this intermediate: Both the t-butyl group (at C4) and the sulfonic acid group (at C1) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3 relative to -SO3H, C5 relative to -SO3H). The resulting product is `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the t-butyl and nitro groups are **ortho** to each other.\n    3.  This is a good step. However, subsequent conversion of the -SO3H group (at C1) into the -OEt group would lead to a 1,3,4-isomer, not the target 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **Option C leads to the wrong product.**\n\n*   **Option D (Similar to C but jumbled)**: This option is nonsensical as written. For instance, step (iv) attempts diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that has no amino group. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A (tBu -> HNO3 -> Fe/HCl -> HNO3 -> NaNO2...)**: This is the only option left. Let's analyze its pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. Standard Friedel-Crafts.\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. To reach the 1,2,3-target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho isomer** (`1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). This step is a major flaw regarding the \"high-yield\" requirement, but let's continue, as other options are impossible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine → **2-tert-butylaniline**. Standard.\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. Under strong acidic conditions, the amino group (-NH2) at C1 is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. It directs the incoming nitro group to position C3. While the t-butyl group at C2 directs elsewhere, the directing effect of the anilinium ion allows for the formation of the required `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. This establishes the key 1,2,3-arrangement.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group. Standard.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → `3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`. Standard.\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol into the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Standard.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of transformations described in steps (i) through (vii) of Option A is a chemically valid pathway to synthesize the target molecule. Its primary weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration in step (ii). However, all other options (B, C, D) contain steps that are chemically impossible or lead definitively to the wrong isomer. In the context of selecting the best possible answer from a given list, a path that has a low-yield step is preferable to paths that are impossible. The additional steps (viii and ix) in Option A are superfluous and act as distractors. Therefore, Option A is the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem asks to identify the correct high-yield reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. Such patterns are often challenging to create via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho*.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho*.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*.\n\n**2. Core Synthetic Challenge and Strategy**\n\nThe \"high-yield\" requirement is critical. Standard reaction sequences often produce mixtures of isomers, violating this condition.\n*   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces mostly the para-isomer, with the required ortho-isomer as a minor product. Any synthetic path relying on this step is not \"high-yield.\"\n*   The final product is extremely sterically congested.\n*   The synthesis must carefully control the regiochemistry. The most powerful tool for this among the given reagents is the use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a **removable blocking group**. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly suggests this strategy is intended.\n\n**3. Evaluating the \"Blocking Group\" Strategy**\n\nA sound, high-yield strategy to create an *ortho* relationship between a tert-butyl group and a nitro group is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.**\n    `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene`\n    This adds the tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).**\n    `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, but sterically favors substitution at the *para* position. This step effectively \"blocks\" the most reactive para position.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    Nitration now occurs on the blocked ring.\n    *   The -tBu group at C4 directs *ortho* (to C3).\n    *   The -SO3H group at C1 directs *meta* (to C3).\n    *   The directing effects are **concordant**, forcing nitration to occur specifically at the C3 position. This produces an intermediate where the -tBu and -NO2 groups are **ortho** to each other, which is a key structural feature of the final product. This initial sequence is the only method presented across the options that can achieve this crucial ortho relationship in high yield.\n\n**4. Analysis of the Options based on the Correct Strategy**\n\nThe options provided appear to be permutations of a similar set of reagents, with many having syntactically impossible ordering. The critical distinction is which option includes the necessary reagents and, most importantly, the correct initial strategy. The blocking group strategy identified above is the only one that satisfies the \"high-yield\" criterion for setting up the required ortho-tert-butyl-nitro intermediate.\n\nWhile the exact ordering of the subsequent steps in all options is convoluted (likely due to typos in the question), a logical pathway can be constructed using the provided reagents to convert the intermediate (`3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`) into the final product. This would involve a complex series of steps like reduction of the nitro group, diazotization to form a phenol, a second nitration, and final removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group and etherification. The key is that the initial steps must follow the blocking group logic.\n\n*   **Option A** is the only one analyzed by the candidate agents that contains the full set of reagents required for the most sophisticated and plausible pathway, including two nitrations and the blocking/deblocking pair (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`).\n*   **Option C (as per Agent 2)** follows a low-yield pathway.\n*   **The path in Option B (as per Agent 7)** also relies on a low-yield step. The alternative high-yield path leads to the wrong isomer.\n*   Options involving direct para-nitration (analyzed by Agents 12 and 14) are high-yield but lead to the wrong isomer (1,2,4 substitution pattern), suggesting a typo in the question's target molecule name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the goal of a **high-yield** synthesis of a complex **1,2,3-isomer**, the most chemically sound approach among the options is the one that utilizes a blocking group to control the initial regiochemistry. While the subsequent steps in the written options are disordered, Option A provides the correct set of reagents and is based on the most plausible high-yield strategy for establishing the difficult ortho-tert-butyl-nitro arrangement. It is the most chemically rigorous pathway when considering the \"high-yield\" constraint.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n- **Parent**: Benzene ring\n- **Substituents**:\n    - C1: Ethoxy (`-OEt`), a strong activating, ortho/para-director.\n    - C2: tert-Butyl (`-tBu`), a moderately activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky.\n    - C3: Nitro (`-NO2`), a strong deactivating, meta-director.\n- **Substitution Pattern**: 1,2,3 (vicinal). This pattern is often challenging to achieve with high yield due to competing electronic effects and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Identify Key Strategic Steps from the Reagents\nThe options include reagents for standard transformations:\n- **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation** (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`): Adds the -tBu group. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) or complexes with basic groups (like aniline).\n- **Nitration** (`HNO3/H2SO4`): Adds the -NO2 group.\n- **Sulfonation & Desulfonation** (`SO3/H2SO4` & `dilute H2SO4`): Suggests the use of the `-SO3H` group as a removable \"blocking group\" to control substitution positions.\n- **Functional Group Interconversion**: A standard sequence is provided to convert one group to another: `Fe/HCl` (reduces `-NO2` to `-NH2`), `NaNO2/HCl` (converts `-NH2` to a diazonium salt `-N2+`), and `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolyzes `-N2+` to `-OH`).\n- **Ether Synthesis** (`NaOH/EtBr`): Converts an `-OH` group to the final `-OEt` group (Williamson ether synthesis).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Pathways\n\nLet's evaluate the primary strategies discussed in the candidate answers. Many agents note that the options are likely flawed or contain typos, so the core chemical strategy is more important than the exact lettering.\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene.**\n- This path starts with `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> ...`\n- The first nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para-isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) because of the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. A high-yield synthesis must utilize this major isomer.\n- As analyzed by several agents (e.g., Candidate 12), following this pathway leads cleanly to a 1,2,4-substituted product (`1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`), not the required 1,2,3 product.\n- **Conclusion**: This is a valid, high-yield synthesis, but for the wrong molecule. If the question had a typo in the target name, this would be the answer.\n\n**Strategy 2: Blocking Group Strategy**\n- This path involves `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> (Sulfonation to block para) -> (Nitration ortho) ...`\n- As several agents correctly analyzed, this is a powerful strategy to control regiochemistry. The sequence `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` successfully establishes the necessary *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n- However, completing the synthesis from this intermediate to the 1,2,3 product is extraordinarily complex. Candidate 8 heroically attempts to outline such a path, but it relies on several questionable assumptions about regioselectivity in later steps. It's unlikely to be the intended \"high-yield\" path.\n\n**Strategy 3: The \"Ortho-Nitration\" Path**\nThis strategy is the most plausible route to the correct product, despite one significant flaw. It is outlined with good reasoning by **Candidate 3**.\n- **Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard)\n- **Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This is the crucial step. This is the *minor* product of the reaction. This step is inherently **not high-yield**, which contradicts the premise of the question. However, if we are forced to find a path to the correct product, we must proceed with this isomer.\n- **Step iii: Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction)\n- **Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key regiochemical step to establish the 1,2,3 pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (`-NH3+`), which is a *meta*-director.\n    - The `-NH3+` group at C1 directs the new nitro group to position C3.\n    - The `-tBu` group at C2 directs ortho to itself, which is also position C3.\n    - **The directors are cooperative!** They both direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a plausible, regioselective step.\n- **Step v: NaNO2/HCl -> Diazonium salt.** (Standard)\n- **Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.** (Standard hydrolysis)\n- **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** (Standard ether synthesis). The final product is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Of all the proposed pathways, **Strategy 3 (the \"Ortho-Nitration\" path)** is the only one that can be logically argued to produce the correct 1,2,3-substituted isomer.\n- Its main weakness is that the first step (the ortho-nitration) is not high-yield. However, all subsequent steps, particularly the key nitration of the aniline derivative, are plausible and regioselective.\n- Other strategies either lead definitively to the wrong isomer (Strategy 1) or are convoluted and unlikely to be the intended answer (Strategy 2).\n- Given the options, the question is likely flawed by asking for a \"high-yield\" synthesis via a path that contains one low-yield step. But among the choices, this path is the only one that reaches the stated destination.\n- The reagents and reaction order described in Strategy 3 are perfectly matched by the sequence presented in **Option A** by candidates 3 and 10. The extra steps at the end of that option are superfluous distractors.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the only chemically plausible (though imperfect) sequence to synthesize the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically hindered and electronically challenging to achieve via simple electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The synthesis must involve a carefully planned sequence, likely utilizing functional group conversions or blocking groups to control regiochemistry. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step proceeds with high regioselectivity and efficiency.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence\n\nWe will analyze each option step-by-step to check for chemical validity and efficiency.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step i) and ii) correctly synthesize aniline from benzene.\n*   Step iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is highly problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is not high-yield and gives a mixture of products, primarily the meta isomer. This route fails the \"high-yield\" criteria.\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n*   This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group.\n*   Step iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The intermediate produced after step iii) (sulfonation of a nitro-compound) does not contain an amino group.\n*   Therefore, the sequence contains a chemically impossible step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   This sequence forms an intermediate that is then treated with `NaNO2/HCl` (step v) to form a diazonium salt.\n*   Step vi) then suggests treating this diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This is not a standard or safe reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they are typically used in Sandmeyer or similar reactions, not as substrates for nitration.\n*   Therefore, this sequence contains a nonsensical step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\nLet's analyze the core of this sequence (steps i-vii), as steps viii and ix (sulfonation followed by desulfonation) are superfluous at the end. There are two possible interpretations of this path:\n\n1.  **Path to the Correct Isomer (low yield):**\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration → **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is the *minor* product; the para isomer is major. This step violates the \"high-yield\" condition from the start.\n    *   iii) Reduction → 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   iv) Second nitration → Plausibly forms 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline, but with regioselectivity issues.\n    *   v-vii) Conversion of the amino group to the ethoxy group. This sequence *can* form the target molecule but is not high-yield.\n\n2.  **Path Following the Major Isomer (high yield):**\n    This is the more likely interpretation for a \"high-yield\" problem, assuming a typo in the name of the target molecule.\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (High-yield).\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. (High-yield major product).\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl` → **4-tert-butylaniline**. (High-yield).\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. In strong acid, the amine is protonated (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Both direct to position 2. This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` → **Diazonium salt**. (High-yield).\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. (High-yield).\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (High-yield).\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) describes a robust, high-yield synthesis of a **1,2,4-substituted isomer**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Options B and D contain chemically impossible steps.\n*   Option C contains a problematic, low-yield step.\n*   Option A, when following the major products at each stage, describes a logical, high-yield synthesis of a specific isomer of the target product (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). The final two steps are distractors.\n\nIn the context of multiple-choice questions involving complex synthesis, it is common for there to be a typo in the target molecule's name. Given that sequence A (steps i-vii) is the only pathway presented that constitutes a valid, high-yield synthesis, it is the most plausible intended answer, with the assumption that the target was meant to be the 1,2,4-isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem asks for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This requires careful analysis of the target molecule's structure and the chemical validity of the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The target is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -tBu groups are *ortho* to each other. The -tBu and -NO2 groups are also *ortho* to each other. Critically, the strongly activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO2 group are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** Achieving this 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially the *meta* relationship between a strong activator and a deactivator, is not straightforward via direct electrophilic substitution. This suggests a complex synthesis, possibly involving functional group conversions or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option for chemical feasibility and whether it can produce the target in \"high-yield\".\n\n*   **Option B and C (and any path using the initial `tBu -> SO3H -> NO2` strategy):**\n    *   Some agents propose a blocking group strategy: i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to get tert-butylbenzene, ii) Sulfonation to get 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position), iii) Nitration.\n    *   This sequence is a valid high-yield strategy. However, let's analyze the product of step (iii). On 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, both the -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) direct the incoming nitro group to position 2. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   In this key intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this entire strategic path leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be correct. Options B and C, which rely on variations of this or other flawed strategies (like Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated aniline derivative), are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   As analyzed by several agents, option D, if re-ordered into a plausible synthesis, describes a robust, high-yield pathway to a structural isomer. The sequence: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butylaniline -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline -> ...` ultimately produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   This is a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the requested 1,2,3-isomer.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   Let's analyze the sequence presented in option A (based on the clearest versions from the candidate answers): `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ;` plus some superfluous steps.\n    *   Let's trace this path step-by-step:\n        1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 ->` **tert-Butylbenzene**\n        2.  `ii) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 ->` The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to steric preference. A high-yield synthesis must use the major product.\n        3.  `iii) ... + Fe/HCl ->` Reduction of the nitro group gives **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        4.  `iv) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 ->` Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects of the t-butyl group and the (protonated) amino group are synergistic, leading to nitration *ortho* to the amino group. This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        5.  `v) ... + NaNO2/HCl ->` Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n        6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat ->` Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr ->` Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final ether.\n    *   **Product:** The sequence produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,4-isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the proposed options lead to chemically impossible steps, fundamentally incorrect isomers, or rely on very low-yield reactions, violating the \"high-yield\" criterion.\n*   Options B and C are incorrect because their core strategy generates the wrong isomer (meta tBu/NO2).\n*   Options A and D both describe coherent, high-yield syntheses of the *same* **1,2,4-isomer** (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`).\n\nGiven the choices, it is extremely likely that the question contains a typo in the name of the target molecule and was intended to ask for the 1,2,4-isomer. Since the sequence of reactions described in option A is chemically sound, high-yield, and represents a standard textbook synthesis pathway (alkylation -> para-nitration -> reduction -> ortho-nitration -> diazotization/hydrolysis -> etherification), it is the most plausible intended answer. The superfluous final steps are distractors. Option A is the best answer because it represents the most logical and viable chemical synthesis among the choices, despite the discrepancy with the named product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis question asks for the correct high-yield synthetic sequence to produce **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This is a complex synthesis problem requiring a careful analysis of substituent directing effects and reaction ordering.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *o,p*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *o,p*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *m*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -tBu and -NO2 groups are *ortho* to each other. The -OEt and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Implication:** The *meta* relationship between the strongly *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is a significant clue. It strongly suggests that the nitration that installed the C3-nitro group did not happen on a ring already containing the ethoxy group (or its precursor, the hydroxyl group). A functional group transformation must be involved.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Plausible High-Yield Strategy\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring in high yield often requires a **blocking group** strategy to control regiochemistry. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options confirms that this is the likely intended path.\n\nA full, chemically sound synthesis can be proposed as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Introduce the bulky -tBu group first.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** Block the sterically favored *para* position with a sulfonic acid group. This group can be removed later.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n3.  **First Nitration:** Now, nitrate the ring. Both the -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (*m*-director) will direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, C2 (relative to the tBu group), creating the crucial *ortho* relationship between tBu and the first NO2.\n    *   Intermediate → **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n4.  **Second Nitration:** To introduce the final nitro group, a second nitration is needed. All existing groups (-SO3H, -tBu, -NO2) cooperatively direct the incoming electrophile to the same position, C5.\n    *   Intermediate → **3,5-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n5.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups must be converted to an amino group to later become the ethoxy group. The nitro group at C5 is less sterically hindered than the one at C3 (next to the bulky tBu). A reducing agent like `Fe/HCl` will selectively reduce the C5 nitro group.\n    *   Intermediate → **5-amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**\n\n6.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking Step):** The sulfonic acid has served its purpose and can now be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Intermediate → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** (the ring renumbers around the amine)\n\n7.  **Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, which is an excellent leaving group.\n    *   Intermediate + `NaNO2/HCl` → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**\n\n8.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol by warming in an aqueous acid solution.\n    *   Intermediate + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    *   Intermediate + `NaOH/EtBr` → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n\nThis complex but logical pathway is the only one that can produce the target molecule in high yield. Now, we must check which option provides the necessary **set of reagents** for this synthesis. The order of steps in the given options is often scrambled or contains typos in this type of question.\n\nLet's check the list of reagents required by our proposed synthesis:\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n*   `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation)\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (two times)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (reduction)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (hydrolysis)\n*   `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (etherification)\n\nNow let's examine the reagent pool provided in **Option C**:\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` (second nitration reagent provided)\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`\n*   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` (sulfonation reagent provided)\n*   ix) `dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation reagent provided)\n\nAlthough the sequence as written in Option C is not in the correct chemical order, it is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents to carry out the plausible, high-yield synthesis described above. The other options are flawed either by containing impossible reaction steps (e.g., diazotizing without an amine) or by following a path that logically leads to an incorrect isomer in high yield.\n\nTherefore, Option C represents the correct collection of reagents needed for the synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires us to identify the most efficient, high-yield synthetic pathway to a specific trisubstituted benzene derivative from a list of options. The target molecule's structure is key to solving this.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3- (or vicinal) substitution pattern. These are often difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects.\n*   **Key Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, favoring *para* substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Synthetic Options\n\nThe core of this problem is to evaluate which reaction sequence is chemically logical and abides by the \"high-yield\" constraint. Let's systematically analyze the strategies presented in the options.\n\n*   **Strategies starting with Nitration (Option C in some agent versions):** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3...` This pathway is fundamentally flawed. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction does not work efficiently, as the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack. This is not a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Strategies starting with Blocking Groups (Option B/C/D in various agent versions):** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...` This is a common and powerful strategy.\n    1.  Benzene is converted to `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  The para position is blocked by sulfonation, giving `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    3.  Nitration now occurs *ortho* to the t-butyl group, giving `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    In this key intermediate, the t-butyl group and the nitro group are **meta** (1,3) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho** (1,2). Therefore, this otherwise excellent strategy leads to the wrong isomeric relationship for the target molecule.\n\n*   **Strategies starting with Direct Nitration of tert-Butylbenzene (Option C in the canonical version):**\n    `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    Let's trace this path, which is the most promising among the options.\n    1.  **Step i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene -> `tert-Butylbenzene`. This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n    2.  **Step ii) Nitration:** The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position. The major product, formed in high yield, is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n    3.  **Step iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group with `Fe/HCl`, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a high-yield step.\n    4.  **Step iv) Nitration:** We nitrate `4-tert-butylaniline`. To achieve a high yield and prevent oxidation, the amino group is usually protected as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3). The protected amide group is a very strong *ortho*-director. The t-butyl group also directs *ortho*. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (ortho to the amide, meta to the t-butyl). This step gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** in high yield (after deprotection).\n    5.  **Step v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`.\n    6.  **Step vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol using `H3O+/Heat`. This yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n    7.  **Step vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the ethoxy ether with `NaOH/EtBr`, giving the final product.\n\n### 3. Conclusion: The Typo Hypothesis\n\nThe product of this logical, high-yield synthesis is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the 1,2,3-isomer requested in the prompt (`2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`).\n\nThis leads to the most reasonable conclusion: The question contains a typo in the name of the target molecule. The chemical sequence that is most sound, and adheres to the \"high-yield\" constraint, is the one that leads to the 1,2,4-isomer.\n\nOption C presents this exact sequence in its first seven steps. The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are nonsensical distractors added to the end of an otherwise correct synthesis. By comparing the options, this pathway is the only one that represents a coherent and efficient multi-step synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure of the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (`-OEt`), a tert-butyl group (`-tBu`), and a nitro group (`-NO2`).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions C1, C2, and C3, respectively. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (or vicinal) pattern.\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Formulate a High-Yield Strategy\n\nSynthesizing a sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer in \"high-yield\" is a significant challenge. Direct, sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is unlikely to work.\n*   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces mainly the *para* isomer due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group. To proceed, one would need to isolate the minor *ortho* product, which violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n*   A key feature is the *meta* relationship between the strongly *ortho, para*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This strongly suggests that the nitro group was introduced to the ring *before* the final ethoxy group was present in its activating form.\n\nThe most effective strategy to overcome unfavorable regiochemistry in EAS is to use a **blocking group**. The sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) is ideal for this because it's a *meta*-director that can be added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options based on Strategy\n\nLet's look for an option that employs a correct blocking group strategy. The correct strategy to force ortho substitution on tert-butylbenzene is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Introduce the -tBu group.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** Block the sterically favored *para* position with `-SO3H`.\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, nitration will be directed to the *ortho* position.\n\nNow we evaluate the initial steps of each option:\n*   **Option A:** `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Sulfonation`. This sequence doesn't use sulfonation as a blocking step; it just adds a sulfonic acid group to an already nitrated molecule. This is not the correct strategy.\n*   **Option B:** `Nitration -> Reduction -> Alkylation`. This is flawed. Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails or is very low-yield on the aniline formed in step (ii).\n*   **Option C:** `Alkylation -> Sulfonation -> Nitration`. This sequence perfectly matches the high-yield blocking group strategy described above. Let's trace these first three steps:\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (The para position is blocked).\n    *   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: The `-tBu` group (at C4) directs ortho, and the `-SO3H` group (at C1) directs meta. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C3, which is ortho to -tBu). This cleanly produces **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (or 2-nitro-4-tert-butyl... depending on numbering). Critically, it creates the required **ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups** in high yield.\n\n*   **Option D:** `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction`. This path relies on the direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which, as established, gives the wrong isomer (para) as the major product and thus cannot be a high-yield synthesis for the ortho-substituted starting material required for the target molecule.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   Options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed for a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. They either contain incorrect chemical steps, are not high-yield, or do not lead to the required substitution pattern.\n*   Option C is the only choice that begins with a correct and powerful synthetic strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to achieve the most difficult part of the synthesis: the high-yield formation of the ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement.\n*   While the later steps in Option C (iv through ix) appear to be listed in a nonsensical or scrambled order (a common issue in complex multiple-choice questions), the initial strategic foundation (steps i, ii, iii) is the only one presented that **could lead to** the high-yield synthesis of the specified product.\n\nTherefore, Option C represents the most chemically sound approach.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge**\n\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (-OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, -NO2 at C3). This is a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) on a substituted ring are governed by the directing effects of the existing groups. Achieving a specific, crowded 1,2,3-pattern in high yield is non-trivial and often requires a sophisticated strategy to control where the new groups are added (regiochemistry).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Core Synthetic Strategies in the Options**\n\nA crucial part of the synthesis is establishing the *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option C:** This involves the direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene (`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`).\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. However, due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position. The desired *ortho* isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is only a minor product.\n    *   A synthesis that relies on isolating a minor product cannot be considered \"high-yield.\" Therefore, the strategy in Option C is fundamentally flawed for this requirement.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option B:** This starts with nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`).\n    *   This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. This makes the Friedel-Crafts reaction fail or give very poor yields. This is not a \"high-yield\" route.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option D:** This option contains a chemically impossible step early in its sequence. Step (iv) attempts to use `NaNO2/HCl` (a reagent for converting an amine to a diazonium salt) on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`, a molecule that does not have an amine group. Thus, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy in Option A:** This option begins with a classic, powerful strategy for controlling regiochemistry: using a **blocking group**.\n    *   **Step i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   **Step ii) `SO3/H2SO4`**: tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The reaction occurs almost exclusively at the *para* position, forming 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n    *   **Step iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: The ring is nitrated. With the para position blocked, the activating t-butyl group can only direct substitution to the *ortho* position. The deactivating -SO3H group also directs *meta* to itself, which is the same *ortho* position. The directing effects are concordant. This leads to a very clean, **high-yield** formation of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the core strategies, the blocking group approach detailed in the first three steps of **Option A** is the only one that can produce the necessary ortho-substituted intermediate in high yield. The other options either rely on a low-yield reaction or contain chemically impossible steps.\n\nWhile the sequence of reactions in the latter half of Option A (specifically step vi, which suggests nitrating an unstable diazonium salt) is chemically flawed, the initial steps (i, ii, and iii) represent the only viable \"high-yield\" strategy presented. In the context of a multiple-choice question with flaws, the correct answer is the one that employs the most correct and powerful chemical principles. The key to this problem is recognizing that the sulfonation/desulfonation blocking group strategy is superior to direct nitration for achieving the desired substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director. It is sterically bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The tBu group is *ortho* to both the OEt and the NO2 groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate General Synthetic Strategies**\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene is challenging. Two main strategies are typically considered:\n*   **Direct Substitution:** Introduce groups one by one, using their directing effects to control placement. This often leads to isomeric mixtures.\n*   **Blocking Group Strategy:** Temporarily block a reactive position (usually with a sulfonic acid group, -SO3H) to force substitution at a less-favored position. The blocking group is then removed.\n\n**3. Analyze the Options Based on Plausibility**\n\nLet's analyze the two main synthetic routes discussed in the candidate answers.\n\n**Strategy 1: The Blocking Group Approach**\nThis strategy is seen in the reasoning for options A, B, C, and D by various agents. The typical sequence is:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** tert-Butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the sulfonic acid group goes to the para position, blocking it).\n3.  **Nitration:** Both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming NO2 group to position 2. This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the tBu group (at C4) and the NO2 group (at C2) are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this entire strategy, while a valid high-yield synthesis, produces the wrong family of isomers and cannot lead to the target molecule. Any option based on this strategy is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy 2: The Direct Sequential Substitution Approach**\nThis strategy is also discussed by many agents, who trace the following sequence of reaction types:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene is nitrated. Due to the steric bulk of the tBu group, this produces a mixture of the *para* isomer (major product, ~70-80%) and the *ortho* isomer (minor product, ~15-20%). To proceed, one must isolate the **minor ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer. This immediately conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine (Fe/HCl), yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **Nitration:** The 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. Under the strong acid conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   On the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming NO2 to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The -tBu group (at C2) directs the incoming NO2 to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The directing effects are **cooperative**, guiding the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is more sterically hindered, but its formation is necessary for the final product. This step can plausibly form the required **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n5.  **Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (NaNO2/HCl).\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (H3O+/Heat).\n7.  **Etherification:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether (NaOH/EtBr).\n\n**Conclusion on Strategies:**\n*   Strategy 1 (Blocking Group) is a high-yield synthesis, but it leads to the wrong isomer.\n*   Strategy 2 (Direct Substitution) is the only pathway discussed that can plausibly form the correct isomer. Its major weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration step. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible (if imperfect) route is superior to one that is chemically impossible or leads definitively to the wrong product.\n\nGiven these considerations, Strategy 2 represents the \"best\" answer among the likely choices, assuming the term \"high-yield\" is used loosely to mean the most viable route. The various candidate answers assign this specific sequence to different letters (A, C, or D). However, the analysis in **Answer 2**, which assigns this sequence to option C, is the most clear-headed. It correctly identifies the low-yield step but recognizes it as the only viable path to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe goal is to find the best multi-step synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene.\n\n**1.  Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with substituents at adjacent positions (a 1,2,3-pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The tBu group and the NO2 group are **ortho** (adjacent) to each other.\n    *   The OEt group and the NO2 group are **meta** to each other.\n*   **Director Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho,para-directors (activating).\n    *   -NO2 is a meta-director (deactivating).\n    *   -SO3H (a potential blocking group) is a meta-director.\n\n**2.  Evaluating Key Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe most difficult part of this synthesis is establishing the **ortho relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups**. There are two primary strategies presented in the options to achieve this:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Using a Blocking Group.** This involves first alkylating benzene, then using a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group to \"block\" the sterically favored *para* position, and then nitrating the ring. Let's analyze this path:\n    1.  Benzene + tBuCl -> **t-Butylbenzene**\n    2.  Sulfonation -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C4, SO3H at C1).\n    3.  Nitration -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (tBu at C4, NO2 at C2, SO3H at C1).\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this intermediate, the tBu group (at C4) and the NO2 group (at C2) are **meta** to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho**. Therefore, this popular blocking group strategy is incorrect for synthesizing this specific target molecule. Any option that relies on this path (like option A) is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Direct Nitration.** This involves nitrating t-butylbenzene directly.\n    1.  Benzene + tBuCl -> **t-Butylbenzene**\n    2.  Nitration -> This gives a mixture of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` (~15-20%) and `para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` (~70-80%).\n    *   To make the target molecule, one must isolate and proceed with the minor **ortho isomer**. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question. However, if other synthetic routes are impossible, this may be the only feasible path.\n\n**3.  Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence `(i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; (ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; (iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...)` follows the flawed blocking group strategy (Strategy 1). It produces an intermediate where the t-butyl and nitro groups are meta, not ortho. Therefore, **Option A cannot produce the target molecule.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence `(i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; (ii) Fe/HCl ; (iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...)` starts by making aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction works poorly or fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **This is not a viable high-yield synthesis.**\n\n*   **Option D:** This option contains typos and scrambled steps (e.g., trying to use `NaNO2/HCl` on a molecule without an amine), making it chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence `(i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; (ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; (iii) Fe/HCl ; (iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` follows the direct nitration approach (Strategy 2). Let's trace the pathway, assuming we carry the necessary intermediate forward.\n    1.  `i)` Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**\n    2.  `ii)` Nitration gives a mixture. We isolate the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (Low yield for this step).\n    3.  `iii)` Reduction of the nitro group -> **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv)` Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Under strong acid conditions, the amine is protonated (-NH3+, a meta-director) and the t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to positions 3 and 5. The desired isomer, **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**, is formed (though likely in a mixture).\n    5.  `v)` Diazotization of the amino group at C1 -> **diazonium salt**.\n    6.  `vi)` Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii)` Williamson ether synthesis -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is the correct target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Options A, B, and D are fatally flawed. Option A leads to the wrong isomer. Option B relies on a failed reaction. Option D is incoherent.\n*   Option C describes a chemically logical pathway that leads to the correct final product. Its main weakness is that some steps are not regioselective and thus not \"high-yield\". However, among the given choices, it is the only one that presents a chemically viable sequence of reactions to form the target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question with flawed options, the one that is chemically possible, even if imperfect, is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Challenge\n*   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2) groups are all adjacent to each other.\n*   **The Challenge:** This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is notoriously difficult to achieve with high yield using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions. This is because the directing effects of the substituents often lead to other isomers (e.g., 1,2,4- or 1,3,5-). For instance:\n    *   Both -OEt and -tBu are ortho-, para- directors.\n    *   The -NO2 group is a meta- director.\n*   The fact that the question specifies a \"high-yield synthesis\" strongly suggests that a simple sequence of direct substitutions will not work. A more complex strategy, likely involving blocking groups and multiple functional group interconversions, is required.\n\n### 2. Propose a Viable High-Yield Synthesis\nA plausible high-yield synthesis for such a sterically hindered and electronically complex target requires precise control of regiochemistry. One advanced but viable pathway proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Start by adding the tert-butyl group. (Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`).\n2.  **Blocking:** Use sulfonation to block the para-position, which is sterically and electronically favored. This forces the next substitution to occur ortho to the tert-butyl group. (`+ SO3/H2SO4`).\n3.  **First Nitration:** Introduce a nitro group. It is directed ortho to the t-Bu group and meta to the -SO3H group, resulting in `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. (`+ HNO3/H2SO4`).\n4.  **Second Nitration:** To achieve the 1,2,3 final pattern, a second nitro group must be added. The existing groups direct this second nitration to position 6 (relative to the tBu at 1 and SO3H at 4), yielding `2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. (`+ HNO3/H2SO4`).\n5.  **Selective Reduction:** Reduce one of the nitro groups to an amine. The nitro group at position 6 is less sterically hindered than the one at position 2 (which is between two groups), so it will be reduced preferentially. (`+ Fe/HCl`). This gives `6-amino-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n6.  **Removal of Blocking Group:** The sulfonic acid group has served its purpose and is now removed via desulfonation. (`+ dilute H2SO4, heat`). This yields `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`, which has the core 1,2,3 arrangement of the required functional groups.\n7.  **Functional Group Conversion:** The amino group needs to be converted into the final ethoxy group. This is a standard three-step process:\n    *   **Diazotization:** Convert the amine to a diazonium salt. (`+ NaNO2/HCl`).\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** Replace the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group to form a phenol. (`+ H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Etherification:** Convert the phenol to an ether. (`+ NaOH/EtBr`).\n\n### 3. Match the Proposed Synthesis to the Options\nNow, we must check which option provides the necessary \"pool\" of reagents to carry out this complex synthesis.\nThe required reagents are:\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (1)\n*   `SO3/H2SO4` (1)\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (2)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (1)\n*   `dilute H2SO4` (1)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (1)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (1)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (1)\n\nLet's examine the reagent list for each option:\n*   **Option A**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4` ; `ii) Fe/HCl` ; `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` ; `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` ; `v) NaNO2/HCl` ; `vi) SO3/H2SO4` ; `vii) dilute H2SO4` ; `viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat` ; `ix) NaOH/EtBr`.\n    This option contains exactly the right number and type of reagents needed for the viable pathway described above, including the crucial second nitration reagent (`HNO3/H2SO4`).\n*   **Options B, C, D**: Each of these options lists only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step. They do not provide the necessary reagents for the second nitration required to build the correct precursor. Furthermore, they contain other fundamental flaws (e.g., incorrect starting steps, impossible reaction sequences).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWhile the order of reactions listed in Option A is illogical and incorrect as written, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents necessary for a viable, albeit complex, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. In the context of challenging multiple-choice synthesis problems, the correct answer is often the one that contains the necessary \"reagent toolkit,\" even if the listed sequence is flawed. The other options fail because they lack the essential reagents for any plausible route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
