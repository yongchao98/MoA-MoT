First, we must identify the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data. Second, we must determine the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data is the first and most critical step. All candidate answers show a consensus on the interpretation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The very broad peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** combined with the strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** confirms the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the alkyl substituent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Structure Determination.**\n    *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: The methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: The methine group (-CH-), which is benzylic (attached to the ring).\n    *   Assembling these fragments correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃]. An isobutyl group, a common distractor, would show a different splitting pattern.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome of the specified reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reaction Analysis.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagents that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Matching the Product to the Options.**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option (C).\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   Let's examine the options provided in the question:\n        *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n        *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer.\n        *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n        *   **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This correctly matches the final product.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Reconciling Candidate Answers.**\n    *   All candidate answers correctly identified the starting material and the final product's chemical structure. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to working with different or scrambled orderings of the multiple-choice options. The chemical reasoning is unanimously correct. Based on the options provided in the prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, far downfield, confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, making them more deshielded.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the second substituent. The combination of a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H), a doublet (1.4 ppm, 3H), a multiplet (1.7 ppm, 2H), and a benzylic multiplet (2.9 ppm, 1H) is uniquely characteristic of a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. An isobutyl group, a common distractor, would show a different pattern (e.g., a doublet for 6H).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe problem states that Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagent Function.** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The stable aromatic ring and the existing alkyl (sec-butyl) group are unaffected by this reaction.\n\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final and most crucial step is to match the derived product name with the specific options provided in the question.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Distinguishing Product from Reactant and Isomers.**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid — Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** — This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid — This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene — This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nThe chemical analysis performed by all candidate agents was unanimously correct. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to working with scrambled option lists. Based on the original options provided, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first break down the problem into three main steps.\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material (Compound X):** I will analyze the provided IR and ¹H NMR data to determine the chemical structure of the initial reactant.\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** I will identify the reagents (red phosphorus and HI) and determine their effect on the functional groups present in Compound X.\n3.  **Determine the Final Product and Match:** Based on the reaction, I will deduce the structure of the final product and match it to the correct multiple-choice option provided in the question.\n\nI will pay close attention to the details of the spectroscopic data to correctly identify the alkyl substituent and the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring. I will also note that the candidate answers all agree on the chemical analysis but differ in their final letter choice, likely due to scrambled option lists.

Based on the options provided in the question, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data. This analysis is consistent across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the definitive signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, which shifts them downfield.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the second substituent. Assembling the fragments based on their chemical shifts and splitting patterns (`0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, and `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`) correctly identifies a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. An isobutyl group is a common distractor but would produce a different NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D) in the provided list, but this is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe problem states that Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagent Function**\n    *   This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. Its specific and well-known function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl side chain (sec-butyl) are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the derived product name with the options provided in the original question.\n\n*   **Derived Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Provided Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n    *   All 15 candidate answers show a complete consensus on the chemical analysis: the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the options being presented in a different, scrambled order for each agent, not due to any error in their chemical reasoning.\n\nBased on the unanimous chemical analysis and the specific options provided in the prompt, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThis step requires a careful analysis of the provided spectroscopic data. All candidate answers correctly identified the structure of Compound X.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The very broad peak in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The pair of doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is a hallmark pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The remaining signals must be assembled to identify the alkyl group.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine group (-CH-) whose downfield shift indicates it is benzylic (attached to the ring).\n    *   Assembling these fragments correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. An isobutyl group, a common distractor, would produce a different NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the data, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D) in the provided list, but this is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nThis step involves identifying the transformation caused by the given reagents.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagent Function.**\n    *   The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the existing sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nBy applying the transformation from Step 2 to the starting material from Step 1, we can determine the final product.\n\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Decision and Matching**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Derived Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   **Provided Options:**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **This matches the derived final product.**\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect isomer (isobutyl vs. sec-butyl).\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemical analysis performed by all candidate answers was unanimously correct.

The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be shifted downfield.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the second substituent.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The fragments combine to form a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. It is crucial not to confuse this with its isomer, the isobutyl group, which would have a different NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThis step involves understanding the chemical transformation caused by the given reagents.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reaction Analysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagents that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) directly to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**. The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl (sec-butyl) group are stable under these conditions and do not react.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Matching the Product to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product with the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option (C). This is a common distractor.\n*   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n*   Let's examine the options:\n    *   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This perfectly matches the derived final product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while they all correctly identified the chemical structures and the reaction outcome, they were working with scrambled lists of options, leading to different final letter choices. However, the chemical reasoning is unanimously correct and leads to the product 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Based on the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a two-step problem. First, we must identify the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data. Second, we must determine the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Compound X (Starting Material)**\n\nThis step involves a careful analysis of the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The very broad peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is the C=O stretch, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid, specifically one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This confirms the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its very downfield position is characteristic.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This classic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be shifted downfield.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Structure.** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the alkyl substituent.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine group (-CH-), which is benzylic (attached to the ring).\n    *   Assembling these fragments correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl** group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. It is crucial not to confuse this with an isobutyl group, which would have a different NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B), which is a common distractor as it represents the starting material, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThis step requires knowledge of the specified chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reaction Analysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Function:** This is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagents that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will have its -COOH group reduced to a -CH₃ group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by these reagents.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.** The signal at 10.5 ppm is the characteristic proton of the carboxylic acid (-COOH). The pair of doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Structure.** The remaining signals (`0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, and `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`) are correctly pieced together by all analyses to form a **sec-butyl** group, [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. The alternative, an isobutyl group, would produce a different NMR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C), but this is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of the Final Product**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the chemical transformation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Function.** The reagents, red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI), constitute a powerful reducing system. Their specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl side chain are unaffected.\n\n**Conclusion on the Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThere is a unanimous consensus among all candidate answers on the chemical identity of both the starting material and the final product. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to the agents working with differently ordered lists of the multiple-choice options.\n\nTo determine the final answer, the derived product name must be matched to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect isomer.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - **This correctly matches the final product.**\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to determine the final product.\n\nThe problem can be solved in two main steps:\n1.

This is because each agent was presented with a differently ordered list of multiple-choice options. The underlying chemical reasoning is sound and unanimous.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is the classic signature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This confirms the acidic proton of the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinct pattern indicates a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Identification.** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the second substituent.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: The methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: The methine group (-CH-), which is attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n    *   Assembling these fragments correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. An isobutyl group, a common distractor, would have a different NMR spectrum (e.g., a doublet for 6H and a multiplet for 1H).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Final Product**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Function.**\n    *   The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of carboxylic acids and other carbonyl compounds to the corresponding alkane.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**. The stable aromatic ring and the existing sec-butyl group will not be affected.\n\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe question asks for the final product. We must match the name \"1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\" to the specific list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid — *Incorrect.* This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene — *Incorrect.* This has the wrong alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n*   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** — **Correct.** This matches the derived final product.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid — *Incorrect.* This is a different structural isomer and is still a carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a two-step problem that requires a careful analysis of spectroscopic data to identify a starting material, followed by an understanding of a specific chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of Compound X from its IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.** The IR data provides key information about the functional groups.\n    *   The very broad peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.** The NMR data allows for the complete assembly of the structure.\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This confirms the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This classic pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, shifting them downfield.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Alkyl Group Identification.** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the alkyl substituent. It is crucial to distinguish between isomers like sec-butyl and isobutyl.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine group (-CH-) attached to the ring (benzylic).\n        *   Assembling these fragments correctly identifies the alkyl substituent as a **sec-butyl** group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. An isobutyl group would have a different NMR signature (e.g., a doublet integrating to 6H).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting material, Compound X, is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome of the reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reaction Analysis.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is one of the few reagents that can completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the existing sec-butyl group are unaffected.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe final step is to match the identified product to the provided options.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Distinguishing Reactant from Product.** The question asks for the *final product*. Option (B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material, not the product.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Distinguishing Isomers.** Option (C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has the incorrect alkyl isomer. Our NMR analysis confirmed a sec-butyl group.\n\nMatching the correct final product, **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, to the list:\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This is the correct final product.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has the incorrect alkyl isomer.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n\nThe analysis shows that all candidate answers correctly determined the chemical structures and the reaction outcome.

This requires a careful analysis of both the IR and NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid, likely conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, far downfield, confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, making them more deshielded (shifted downfield).\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the second substituent on the ring.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂ group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2H is a -CH₂ group, coupled to both the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the -CH at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1H is the -CH group. Its chemical shift indicates it is benzylic (attached to the ring), and it is coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments -CH(CH₃)- and -CH₂CH₃ combine to form a **sec-butyl group**.
