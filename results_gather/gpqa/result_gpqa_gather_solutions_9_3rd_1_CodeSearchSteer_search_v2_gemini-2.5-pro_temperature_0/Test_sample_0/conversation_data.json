This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which one can simultaneously know a quantum state's energy and its lifetime. A state that exists for only a short time cannot have a perfectly defined energy.\n\n2.  **State the Relevant Formula**\n    The energy-time uncertainty principle is expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations involving the lifetime (τ) of a state, the minimum uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as the natural linewidth, can be approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂) and is therefore the primary limiting factor for resolution.

This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics states that there is an inherent limit to the precision with which one can simultaneously know a particle's energy and its lifetime. The relationship is expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For practical calculations, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also called the natural linewidth or energy width), τ is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Define the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" Levels**\n    A quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a single, perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" over a range ΔE. To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two such energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy width, and this larger width is the primary factor limiting the resolution. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two energy widths.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n    We apply the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/τ to each state:\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Apply the Resolution Condition and Evaluate Options**\n    The larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. For the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be greater than this value:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Now, we evaluate the given options against this condition:\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly **greater** than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Note: 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This is a valid difference.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This value is much **smaller** than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This value is **smaller** than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Note: 10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷).\n    *   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This value is much **smaller** than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    Only option A provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two levels.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Inverse Relationship:** The central concept is the inverse relationship between a state's lifetime (τ) and its energy uncertainty (ΔE). A shorter lifetime leads to a broader, more uncertain energy level.\n*   **The Limiting Factor:** The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) and therefore sets the minimum requirement for the energy separation needed for resolution.\n*   **\"Clearly Resolved\":** This term implies that the energy separation must be significantly larger than the energy widths, so their probability distributions do not significantly overlap. The value 10⁻⁴ eV is over 100 times larger than the required minimum, satisfying this condition well.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physics, the calculation, and the final numerical result of 10⁻⁴ eV.

According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core of this question lies in the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics establishes an inverse relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the precision with which its energy can be determined.\n\nThe mathematical relationship is expressed as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical calculations, this is often approximated as:\n**ΔE ≈ ħ / τ**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width. It represents the \"smear\" or range of energies the state can have.\n*   **τ** (or Δt) is the lifetime of the state.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately **6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**. Using this value is convenient as it yields the energy directly in electron-volts (eV), matching the units in the options.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each of the two quantum states.\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### **3. Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two energy distributions will overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the **shorter lifetime** (State 1) has the **larger energy width** (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). This larger width is the primary limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n**|E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow, we check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is **not** greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This **is** greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Note: 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷)\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is **not** greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is **not** greater than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Note: 10⁻⁸ = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷)\n\nThe only option that provides an energy difference large enough for the states to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n### **Careful Points and Synthesis of Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Universal Agreement on Physics**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as the key concept and performed the calculation correctly, arriving at a required energy difference greater than ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n2.  **The Limiting Factor**: It is crucial to recognize that the state with the *shorter* lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the *larger* energy width and therefore dictates the minimum energy separation required for resolution.\n3.  **Meaning of \"Clearly Resolved\"**: This phrase implies the energy separation should be significantly larger than the energy width, not just equal to or slightly larger. The value 10⁻⁴ eV is over 100 times larger than the minimum requirement, satisfying this condition unambiguously.\n4.  **Option Mapping Discrepancy**: The candidate answers provided different final letters (A, B, C, D) because the options were presented to them in a scrambled order. However, the numerical conclusion was consistently **10⁻⁴ eV**. Based on the specific list of options in the question prompt, this value corresponds to option B.\n\nThe code execution confirms this analysis, showing that only option B (1.0e-04 eV) is greater than the required resolution limit of 6.582e-07 eV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: All candidate answers correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle establishes a fundamental relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) and the inherent uncertainty or \"width\" of its energy level (ΔE).\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The principle is mathematically expressed as ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations, this is approximated as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. Using ħ in these units directly yields the energy width (ΔE) in electron-volts (eV).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**: A state with a finite lifetime does not have a single, sharp energy value but is spread out over a range.\n    *   **State 1**: Has a shorter lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. This results in a *larger* energy width.\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n    *   **State 2**: Has a longer lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. This results in a *smaller* energy width.\n        ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n4.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the broader energy level (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV) and therefore presents the main obstacle to resolution.

A shorter lifetime implies a larger, more \"fuzzy\" energy level.\n*   **The Limiting Factor**: The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width and is therefore the critical factor determining if the levels can be resolved.
