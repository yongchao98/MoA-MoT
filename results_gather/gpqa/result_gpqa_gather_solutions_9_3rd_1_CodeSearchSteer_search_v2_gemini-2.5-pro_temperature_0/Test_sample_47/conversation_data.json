Determining the Reaction Pathway and Products**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. For cyclic ketones, this results in a ring contraction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is key. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. It selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified this reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**2. Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring. Hydrogens that are not interchangeable by this symmetry are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are in different chemical environments relative to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, one is *trans*). Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are split into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons each. (2 types)\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of two equivalent protons each. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed this analysis and arrived at the number 6. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to variations in the provided multiple-choice options. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the number 6 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Each Product in the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem outlines a four-step synthesis. The key to solving the problem is to correctly identify the product of each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    This is a critical step. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This specific rearrangement results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3**\n    This is a standard laboratory method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific function is to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogen atoms are in non-equivalent chemical environments and would produce separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes. This results in an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n2.  **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    *   **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl. This is **1 type**.\n    *   **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    *   **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis*, one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    *   **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 6\nB) 8\nC) 7\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task**: The main goal is to determine the correct answer to a multi-step organic chemistry question by analyzing the provided candidate answers. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product of a four-step reaction sequence. I need to present my analysis and conclusion in a Python code block.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**: I will break down the four chemical reactions described. This involves identifying the starting material, reagent, and product for each step.\n    *   **Step 1**: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂). This is a well-known α-halogenation of a ketone. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n    *   **Step 2**: 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**, especially for an α-halo ketone with an available α'-proton. This reaction results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, and the functional group becomes a carboxylic acid (after workup). The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. All candidate answers correctly identify this crucial step.\n    *   **Step 3**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride. All candidate answers agree on this.\n    *   **Step 4**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent known for selectively reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes without over-reduction to alcohols. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. All candidate answers correctly identify this final product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Product's Structure**: The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The core of the question is to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n    *   I will count the distinct hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n        1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO) is unique. (1 type)\n        2.  The **proton on C1** (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n        3.  The protons on **C2 and C5** are equivalent by symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). This results in two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 types)\n        4.  The protons on **C3 and C4** are also equivalent by symmetry. Similarly, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic, resulting in another two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    *   The total count is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: The chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and leads to the correct conclusion that there are 6 distinct hydrogen atoms. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) stems from confusion about which letter corresponds to which number in the multiple-choice options. I will use the options provided in the original prompt: A) 6, B) 8, C) 7, D) 10.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will create a Python script that programmatically follows this logic. It will:\n    *   Outline the reaction steps and identify the final product.\n    *   Explain the symmetry analysis and the counting of distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Calculate the total number of distinct hydrogens.\n    *   Define the options as given in the prompt.\n    *   Match the calculated number (6) to the correct option letter (A).\n    *   Print a clear, step-by-step explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_organic_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis to solve the given\n    organic chemistry problem, determines the final answer, and matches it\n    to the provided options.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Step 1: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence ###\")\n    reactions = [\n        \"1.

The identity of the product at each stage is crucial.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1:** The first step is an α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH/heat → Product 2:** The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under heat is the classic condition for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction is characterized by a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂/pyridine → Product 3:** This is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is substituted with a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific utility is the reduction of reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified this reaction pathway, showing a strong consensus on the final product's identity.\n\n### **Step 2: Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. In a proton NMR spectrum, each set of chemically non-equivalent protons will produce a distinct signal.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes. This results in an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Counting the unique proton environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n    2.  **The C1 proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon directly bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 distinct type)\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically non-equivalent due to their different spatial relationships with the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, one is *trans*). The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more distinct types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The C3 and C4 protons:** The same logic applies. The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types gives: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently shows that the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, has **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

(2 types)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of these types:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nThe chemical reasoning is sound and leads to the conclusion that there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 7\nB) 6\nC) 8\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number, 6, corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations and the structure of the final product, here is the definitive answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Tracing the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1:** The first reaction is an α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH/heat → Product 2:** The treatment of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under heat leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This is a critical step that involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂/pyridine → Product 3:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific role is to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring. This symmetry makes certain pairs of carbons and their associated hydrogens chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This accounts for **one** type of hydrogen.\n    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon directly bonded to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **second** type.\n    3.  **The C2/C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the carbons at positions 2 and 5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not chemically equivalent due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis*-like, the other is *trans*-like) to the aldehyde group. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into **two** distinct sets.\n    4.  **The C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the carbons at positions 3 and 4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** distinct sets of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem involves a four-step organic synthesis followed by a structural analysis of the final product. The key is to correctly identify the product of each reaction and then analyze its symmetry.\n\n**1. Determining the Reaction Pathway and Products**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone, where a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical transformation. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. For cyclic ketones like this, the rearrangement results in a ring contraction. A common mistake would be to assume a simple elimination or substitution reaction.\n    *   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂), Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard and reliable method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The choice of reducing agent is crucial. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reagent. It selectively reduces highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to the corresponding alcohol, which would occur with a stronger reagent like LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in non-equivalent environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n*   **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl. This is **1 type**.\n    2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis*, one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

Hydrogens that are not interchangeable by this symmetry are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The Proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n3.  **The Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are in different chemical environments relative to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, one is *trans*). Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are split into two distinct sets of two equivalent protons each. (2 types)\n4.  **The Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes these two carbons equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of two equivalent protons each. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed this analysis and arrived at the number 6. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to variations in the provided multiple-choice options. Based on the options provided in this specific problem, the number 6 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Each Product in the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe problem outlines a four-step synthesis. The key to solving the problem is to correctly identify the product of each reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    This is an α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    This is a critical step. The reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under these conditions leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This specific rearrangement results in a ring contraction.

Its specific function is to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogen atoms are in non-equivalent chemical environments and would produce separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes. This results in an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n\n2.  **Counting the Unique Hydrogen Environments:**\n    *   **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment, bonded to a carbonyl. This is **1 type**.\n    *   **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd type**.\n    *   **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not equivalent to each other due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis*, one is *trans*) with the aldehyde group. The two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are equivalent to each other, but the *cis* set is distinct from the *trans* set. This gives **2 more types** of hydrogens.\n    *   **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes carbons C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 6\nB) 8\nC) 7\nD) 10\n\nThe calculated number is 6, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy thinking process to arrive at the final answer is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Task**: The main goal is to determine the correct answer to a multi-step organic chemistry question by analyzing the provided candidate answers. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product of a four-step reaction sequence. I need to present my analysis and conclusion in a Python code block.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**: I will break down the four chemical reactions described. This involves identifying the starting material, reagent, and product for each step.\n    *   **Step 1**: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂). This is a well-known α-halogenation of a ketone. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. All candidate answers correctly identify this.\n    *   **Step 2**: 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**, especially for an α-halo ketone with an available α'-proton. This reaction results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, and the functional group becomes a carboxylic acid (after workup). The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. All candidate answers correctly identify this crucial step.\n    *   **Step 3**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride. All candidate answers agree on this.\n    *   **Step 4**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent known for selectively reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes without over-reduction to alcohols. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. All candidate answers correctly identify this final product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Product's Structure**: The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. The core of the question is to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n    *   I will count the distinct hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n        1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO) is unique. (1 type)\n        2.  The **proton on C1** (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n        3.  The protons on **C2 and C5** are equivalent by symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). This results in two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 types)\n        4.  The protons on **C3 and C4** are also equivalent by symmetry. Similarly, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic, resulting in another two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    *   The total count is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: The chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and leads to the correct conclusion that there are 6 distinct hydrogen atoms.

This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making the carbons and hydrogens on one side equivalent to those on the other.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** The single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry.

A hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH/heat → Product 2:** The treatment of an α-halo ketone with a strong base under heat leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This is a critical step that involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 + SOCl₂/pyridine → Product 3:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its specific role is to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Product 4 for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring. This symmetry makes certain pairs of carbons and their associated hydrogens chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This accounts for **one** type of hydrogen.\n    2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon directly bonded to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **second** type.\n    3.  **The C2/C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes the carbons at positions 2 and 5 equivalent. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are **diastereotopic**. This means they are not chemically equivalent due to their different spatial relationships (one is *cis*-like, the other is *trans*-like) to the aldehyde group. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 are divided into **two** distinct sets.\n    4.  **The C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the carbons at positions 3 and 4 equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** distinct sets of hydrogens.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 8\nB) 7\nC) 10\nD) 6\n\nThe calculated number matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
