The solution requires combining two fundamental concepts: the exponential law of radioactive decay and the special relativity principle of time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is given by the exponential decay law. This law is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle itself, known as its proper time, `t_p`. The formula is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   From the laboratory's perspective, the particle travels a distance `R` (the detector radius) in a time `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the proper time that passes for the particle during its journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this into the decay formula gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for `γ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    Rearranging gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, the product `-γ * ln(f)` must also be constant.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    We can set up the following equality:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    Plugging in the known values and solving for `γ₂`:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    The negative signs on both sides cancel out.\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can write `ln(1/3) = -ln(3)` and `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3) / -ln(3/2)) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. We must now compare this result to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 28\n    B) 68\n    C) 54\n    D) 40\n    The calculated value of 54.2 is closest to 54, which is option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Physics Foundation:** The core of the problem is the correct application of time dilation. The decay rate is constant in the particle's own reference frame (proper time), so the lab-frame travel time must be converted to proper time using the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Ratiometric Solution:** The key to solving the problem without knowing the particle's lifetime (`τ`) or the detector radius (`R`) is to recognize that the term `R/(cτ)` is a constant, allowing for a ratiometric solution that eliminates these unknowns.\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All provided candidate answers correctly derive the formula and calculate the numerical result to be approximately 54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) stem from being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The crucial final step is to match the robustly calculated numerical answer (54) to the specific list of options given in this prompt.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The problem is solved by combining two core concepts of modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction `f` of unstable particles that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by the formula `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, a moving particle's clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:** We need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the quantities measured in the lab.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The proper time experienced by the particle during this flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (cγ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratiometric Approach to Solve:** The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    We can now set up an equation for each scenario:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n\n    By taking the natural logarithm of the simplified equation, `ln(f) = -K / γ`, we can isolate the constant `K`: `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    Plugging in the known values:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    The negative signs on both sides cancel. We can now solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify the expression:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3)] / [-ln(3/2)] = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately **54.2**.

The lab time (`t_lab`) must be correctly converted to proper time using the time dilation formula.\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** The proper time is shorter than the lab time: `t_p = t_lab / γ`. Inverting this relationship is a common error.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c` is justified by the problem statement and is essential for simplifying the calculation of the travel time.\n*   **Logical Consistency Check:** To increase the survival fraction (from 1/3 to 2/3), the particles must experience less decay. This requires their internal clocks to run slower relative to the lab, which corresponds to a larger time dilation effect and thus a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the answer is physically reasonable.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving the problem without needing the explicit values of `R` or `τ` is recognizing that the term `R / (cτ)` is a constant, which allows for the elimination of these variables through a ratio.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The mathematical derivation and calculation consistently yield a value of ~54.2 across all plausible analyses. The final step is to correctly match this numerical result to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nMy plan is to first re-derive the correct physical relationship and formula, as all candidate answers have done. Then, I will use Python to perform the calculation to get a precise numerical result. Finally, I will carefully compare this result to the options provided in the original question to select the correct choice, noting that this final step was a point of confusion in the candidate answers.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two core concepts: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by the exponential decay law, which is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle itself (its proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    Here, `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is longer than the proper time `t_p` due to the particle's high speed. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The time it takes for the particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab is `t_lab ≈ R/c` (since it's ultra-relativistic). Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n\n4.  **Combine Equations:** Substituting the proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Use a Ratio to Solve:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. By taking the natural logarithm, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is constant, we can equate the two scenarios:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown (`γ₂`):** We can now solve for the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values in:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:** This expression can be calculated numerically. A logical check confirms our approach: to have a higher survival fraction (2/3 > 1/3), the particles must experience less proper time, which requires a larger time dilation effect and thus a higher Lorentz factor. The answer must be greater than 20.

The final step is to match this result to the correct option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles (`f`) that have not decayed after a certain time is described by an exponential function. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own reference frame (its proper frame). The fraction of particles surviving after a proper time `t_p` is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of a stationary observer (in the laboratory frame), a moving particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. This means the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to relate the survival fraction `f` to the Lorentz factor `γ` using quantities measured in the lab.\n\n*   **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Proper Time of Flight:** The amount of time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   **Combined Survival Equation:** Substitute this expression for proper time `t_p` into the fundamental decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### **3. Use a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nIn the equation `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`, the term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This is because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two experimental scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can solve for `γ` by first taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\nRearranging gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n`-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nNow, we plug in the known values and solve for the unknown `γ₂`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these into the equality:\n`-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify the expression:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n### **5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe python code executed the calculation for `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`.\nThe output confirms the result:\n`The calculated Lorentz factor is: 54.19`\n\n### **6. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Calculation Result:** The calculation yields a Lorentz factor of approximately 54.19.\n*   **Matching to Options:** Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 54\n    B) 28\n    C) 68\n    D) 40\n    The calculated value of 54.19 is closest to **54**.\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the answer is physically reasonable.\n*   **Consistency:** All sound analyses of this problem lead to the same formula and numerical result. The key is to correctly apply the principles of time dilation to the exponential decay law.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the analysis of the provided candidate answers and the problem statement, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The problem is solved by combining two core concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction `f` of unstable particles that survive after a proper time `t_p` (the time experienced in the particle's own reference frame) is given by the formula `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, a moving particle's internal clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock.

Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Thus, the lab time of flight is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during this flight. From the time dilation formula, `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this expression for proper time into the exponential decay law gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γc)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n3.  **Use a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios.

Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the lab-frame quantities and the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n*   **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius). The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Proper Time of Flight:** The time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is the proper time, `t_p`. Using the time dilation formula, we find `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   **Survival Fraction Formula:** We substitute this proper time `t_p` into the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-(R / (γc)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n### **3. Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can now apply this to the two scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`, we can eliminate the constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm of the equation for both scenarios and then forming a ratio.\n*   `ln(f₁) = -K / γ₁`\n*   `ln(f₂) = -K / γ₂`\n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n`ln(f₂) / ln(f₁) = (-K / γ₂) / (-K / γ₁) = γ₁ / γ₂`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(f₁) / ln(f₂))`\n\n### **4.

So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The proper time experienced by the particle during this flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (γc)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratiometric Solution:** The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for this constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n\n    Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set them equal:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** We are given the following information:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 40\n    B) 68\n    C) 28\n    D) 54\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Frame of Reference:** The most critical step is to correctly apply the physics. The exponential decay law is fundamentally based on the particle's proper time (`t_p`), not the lab time. The time dilation formula (`t_p = t_lab / γ`) is the essential link between the two reference frames.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The solution hinges on recognizing that the term `R / (cτ)` is a constant for both scenarios. This allows for a ratiometric solution that eliminates the need to know the particle's proper lifetime or the detector's radius explicitly.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** To increase the survival fraction from 1/3 to 2/3, the particles must \"age\" less during their journey. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The numerical calculation across almost all candidate answers is correct (~54.2). The primary source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly matching this calculated value to the lettered options, likely because they were presented with a different list of choices. Based on the options provided in the prompt, the value 54 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, the following step-by-step derivation and careful points lead to the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The problem is solved by combining two fundamental concepts from modern physics: the exponential law of particle decay and the special relativistic effect of time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by the exponential decay law, which is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle in its own reference frame (its proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    Here, `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime (its lifetime in its rest frame).\n\n3.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:** The time measured in the laboratory's frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the proper time experienced by the moving particle. The two are related by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n    Therefore, the proper time that passes for the particle during its journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Time of Flight:** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) in the lab frame. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is therefore:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** By substituting the expressions for `t_p` and `t_lab` into the survival equation, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n6.  **Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for this constant by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set them equal:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** We plug in the given values:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`, the equation becomes:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n9.  **Select the Final Answer:** The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 54\n    C) 68\n    D) 40\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 54, which corresponds to option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to use the particle's proper time (`t_p`) in the exponent of the decay law. The core of the problem is correctly relating the lab-frame travel time to the proper time using the time dilation formula.\n*   **Logical Consistency Check:** To increase the fraction of surviving particles (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must experience less decay. This requires their internal clocks to run slower relative to the lab, which corresponds to a larger time dilation effect and thus a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The solution hinges on recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios, which allows for a ratiometric solution without needing to know the explicit values of the radius or the particle's lifetime.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and calculation were consistently correct, the final letter choice often varied. This is due to different option lists being used. Based on the options provided in this specific problem (A=28, B=54, C=68, D=40), the calculated value of ~54.2 unambiguously corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The problem is solved by combining two core concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction `f` of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law.

The lab time (`t_lab`) must be correctly converted to proper time using the time dilation formula.\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** The proper time is shorter than the lab time: `t_p = t_lab / γ`. Inverting this relationship is a common error.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c` is justified by the problem statement and is essential for simplifying the calculation of the travel time.\n*   **Logical Consistency Check:** To increase the survival fraction (from 1/3 to 2/3), the particles must experience less decay. This requires their internal clocks to run slower relative to the lab, which corresponds to a larger time dilation effect and thus a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the answer is physically reasonable.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving the problem without needing the explicit values of `R` or `τ` is recognizing that the term `R / (cτ)` is a constant, which allows for the elimination of these variables through a ratio.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The mathematical derivation and calculation consistently yield a value of ~54.2 across all plausible analyses.

Finally, I will carefully compare this result to the options provided in the original question to select the correct choice, noting that this final step was a point of confusion in the candidate answers.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two core concepts: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by the exponential decay law, which is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle itself (its proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    Here, `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is longer than the proper time `t_p` due to the particle's high speed. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The time it takes for the particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab is `t_lab ≈ R/c` (since it's ultra-relativistic). Therefore, the proper time the particle experiences is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n\n4.  **Combine Equations:** Substituting the proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Use a Ratio to Solve:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. By taking the natural logarithm, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is constant, we can equate the two scenarios:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown (`γ₂`):** We can now solve for the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values in:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation and Conclusion:** This expression can be calculated numerically. A logical check confirms our approach: to have a higher survival fraction (2/3 > 1/3), the particles must experience less proper time, which requires a larger time dilation effect and thus a higher Lorentz factor.

The final step is to match this result to the correct option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles (`f`) that have not decayed after a certain time is described by an exponential function. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own reference frame (its proper frame). The fraction of particles surviving after a proper time `t_p` is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of a stationary observer (in the laboratory frame), a moving particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. This means the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to relate the survival fraction `f` to the Lorentz factor `γ` using quantities measured in the lab.\n\n*   **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Proper Time of Flight:** The amount of time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   **Combined Survival Equation:** Substitute this expression for proper time `t_p` into the fundamental decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### **3. Use a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nIn the equation `f = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`, the term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant. This is because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two experimental scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can solve for `γ` by first taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\nRearranging gives `K = -γ * ln(f)`.\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n`-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nNow, we plug in the known values and solve for the unknown `γ₂`.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these into the equality:\n`-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify the expression:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n### **5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe python code executed the calculation for `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`.\nThe output confirms the result:\n`The calculated Lorentz factor is: 54.19`\n\n### **6.

The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation in Lab Frame Terms:**\n    *   First, we find the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel the detector radius `R`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle during this flight. From the time dilation formula, `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (cγ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We can now write an equation for each scenario:\n        *   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`  =>  `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        *   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`   =>  `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   To solve for `γ₂` without needing to find `K`, we can take the natural logarithm of both equations and then take their ratio.\n        *   `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        *   `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    *   Dividing the second equation by the first eliminates `-K`:\n        `ln(2/3) / ln(1/3) = (-K / γ₂) / (-K / 20) = 20 / γ₂`\n    *   Solving for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, the expression simplifies:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3)] / [-ln(3/2)] = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

A common mistake is to use the lab time directly. The time dilation formula `t_p = t_lab / γ` is the essential link between the two frames.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c` is justified by the problem statement and is necessary to calculate the lab-frame travel time without more information.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to a simple solution is recognizing that the term `R / (cτ)` is constant across both scenarios. This allows for the creation of a ratio that eliminates the need to know the specific values of the radius or the particle's proper lifetime.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their decay must be \"slowed down\" more from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Matching:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and calculation were consistently correct, errors were made in matching the numerical result (~54.2) to the correct lettered option. Careful comparison is the final, crucial step.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a definitive step-by-step solution and a list of crucial points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** The problem combines two fundamental concepts: the exponential decay of unstable particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is given by the exponential decay law, which must be based on the time experienced by the particle itself (its proper time, `t_p`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n    Here, `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The time measured in the laboratory frame (`t_lab`) for the particle to travel the detector radius `R` is `t_lab ≈ R/c`, since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\" (`v ≈ c`). Time dilation relates the lab time to the proper time via the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\n4.  **Combine Equations:** Substituting the expression for `t_p` into the survival equation yields the relationship between the survival fraction `f` and the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n5.  **Set Up a Ratiometric Solution:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. By taking the natural logarithm, we get `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which can be rearranged to `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is constant, we can equate the two scenarios:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    The negative signs cancel. Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `20 * [-ln(3)] = γ₂ * [-ln(3/2)]`\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Solving for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.7095 ≈ 54.19`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Model:** The core of the problem is correctly applying the time dilation formula (`t_p = t_lab / γ`) to the exponential decay law, which is fundamentally based on the particle's proper time.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The solution hinges on recognizing that the term `R / (cτ)` is a constant, which allows for the elimination of unknown variables (`R` and `τ`) by setting up a ratio between the two scenarios.\n*   **Logical Sanity Check:** To increase the survival fraction (from 1/3 to 2/3), the particles must \"age\" less during their journey.

Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the lab-frame quantities and the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n*   **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius). The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Proper Time of Flight:** The time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is the proper time, `t_p`. Using the time dilation formula, we find `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   **Survival Fraction Formula:** We substitute this proper time `t_p` into the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-(R / (γc)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n### **3. Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can now apply this to the two scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`, we can eliminate the constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm of the equation for both scenarios and then forming a ratio.\n*   `ln(f₁) = -K / γ₁`\n*   `ln(f₂) = -K / γ₂`\n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n`ln(f₂) / ln(f₁) = (-K / γ₂) / (-K / γ₁) = γ₁ / γ₂`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(f₁) / ln(f₂))`\n\n### **4. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow, we plug in the known values:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n### **5.

Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the physical reasoning is sound.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The solution hinges on recognizing that the term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant across both scenarios, which allows for a ratiometric solution without needing to know the explicit values of the radius or the particle's lifetime.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while the physics and calculation were consistently correct, the final letter choice often varied. This is due to different option lists being used. Based on the options provided in this specific problem (A=28, B=54, C=68, D=40), the calculated value of ~54.2 unambiguously corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct logic from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The problem is solved by combining two core concepts from modern physics:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction `f` of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. This law is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle in its own reference frame, known as proper time (`t_p`). The equation is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of a stationary observer (the lab frame), a moving particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:** We need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the variables given in the problem.\n    *   First, we find the time of flight in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The particles travel the detector radius `R`. The problem states they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Next, we find the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle during this flight. Using the time dilation formula, `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n    *   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratiometric Solution:** The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius, the speed of light, and the particle's intrinsic proper lifetime are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`. We can solve for this constant `K` by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -K / γ`, which rearranges to `K = -γ * ln(f)`. Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions equal:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** We plug in the values from the two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    The negative signs cancel. We can now solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Using the properties of logarithms, specifically `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify the expression:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3)] / [-ln(3/2)]`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 68\n    C) 40\n    D) 54\n\n    The calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to use the particle's proper time (`t_p`) in the fundamental decay equation. The time dilation formula (`t_p = t_lab / γ`) correctly connects the lab frame to the particle's frame.\n*   **Identifying Constants:** The key to solving the problem without needing the values for `R` or `τ` is recognizing that the term `R / (cτ)` is constant, which allows for the creation of a ratio that eliminates these unknowns.\n*   **Logical Check:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the physical reasoning.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The calculation consistently yields a value of ~54.2 across all valid analyses. The final step is to correctly match this numerical result to the corresponding lettered option. Based on the options provided, 54 is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
