The only discrepancies arise from clerical errors in matching the calculated number to the correct letter option. The following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved by applying the laws of conservation of energy and momentum from the theory of special relativity.\n\n**1. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\nThe relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   Energy of the electron (`E_e`): With `γ_e = 4`, the energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n*   Energy of the positron (`E_p`): With `γ_p = 2`, the energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n*   The total initial energy (`E_initial`) is the scalar sum of the two:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity.\n\n*   Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from the left) as the positive x-direction.\n*   Momentum of the electron (`p_e`): `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15`.\n*   Momentum of the positron (`p_p`): It moves in the opposite (negative x) direction. `p_p = -m_e c√(2² - 1) = -m_e c√3`.\n*   The total initial momentum (`P_initial`) is the vector sum, which is entirely along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\nThe initial energy and momentum are conserved and transferred to the two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The problem states the two photons have equal energy (`E_γ`). Therefore, the total final energy is `E_final = 2E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = 2E_γ`  =>  `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n    `p_γ = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n**4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total initial momentum was non-zero and purely in the horizontal (+x) direction. Therefore, the final momentum must also be purely horizontal.\n\n*   For the vertical components of momentum to cancel, the two photons (which have equal momentum magnitude) must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`. The total angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum (`P_final`) is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta:\n    `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`  =>  `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\nWe can simplify the equation by canceling the `m_e c` term from both sides.\n\n*   `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n*   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n    *   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Vector vs. Scalar:** Energy is a scalar and adds directly. Momentum is a vector, and since the particles move in opposite directions, their momenta are subtracted to find the net momentum.\n*   **Symmetry:** The fact that the photons have equal energy and the initial momentum is purely horizontal dictates that the photons must be emitted symmetrically around the horizontal axis.\n*   **Half Angle vs. Full Angle:** The angle `θ` derived from the `cos(θ)` calculation is the angle of one photon relative to the axis of initial motion. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Final Answer:** The calculated angle is approximately 138.2°. This value corresponds to the numerical option 138.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity. I will first derive the formula for the angle between the photons based on the initial conditions and then use Python to perform the numerical calculation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron, given by `E = γmc²`.\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision is the vector sum of the relativistic momenta of the two particles, given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta will be subtracted.\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:** After annihilation, two photons are produced. By energy conservation, the initial energy is split equally between the two photons. The momentum of each photon is then `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n4.  **Apply Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum must equal the final momentum. The final momentum is the vector sum of the two photon momenta. Since the initial momentum is purely horizontal, the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles (`θ` and `-θ`) to the horizontal axis. The final horizontal momentum is `2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:** By equating the initial and final momentum, I will derive an expression for `cos(θ)`. The angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to compute the numerical value of `2θ` in degrees, compare it to the given options, and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_photon_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the angle between two photons from an electron-positron annihilation\n    based on their initial Lorentz factors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Lorentz factors from the problem description\n    gamma_electron = 4\n    gamma_positron = 2\n\n    # The derivation from conservation of energy and momentum leads to the following\n    # formula for the cosine of half the angle between the photons (theta).\n    # E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m * c^2\n    # P_initial = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c\n    # E_photon = E_initial / 2\n    # p_photon = E_photon / c\n    # P_final = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)\n    # Equating P_initial and P_final and simplifying gives:\n    # cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)\n    \n    # Calculate the numerator of the cos(theta) expression\n    numerator = math.sqrt(gamma_electron**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_positron**2 - 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the denominator\n    denominator = gamma_electron + gamma_positron\n    \n    # Calculate cos(theta)\n    cos_theta = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\n    theta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n    # Convert theta from radians to degrees\n    theta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n    # The question asks for the total angle between the two photons, which is 2 * theta\n    total_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\n    print(f\"The Lorentz factor of the electron is: {gamma_electron}\")\n    print(f\"The Lorentz factor of the positron is: {gamma_positron}\")\n    print(f\"The angle of one photon relative to the horizontal axis is: {theta_deg:.2f} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"The total angle between the two photons is: {total_angle:.2f} degrees.\")\n    \n    # Compare the calculated result with the given options\n    options = {'A': 172, 'B': 74, 'C': 96, 'D': 138}\n    print(\"\\nComparing the result with the options:\")\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{choice}) {value}\")\n\n    # Find the closest option by minimizing the absolute difference\n    closest_choice = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - total_angle))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated angle {total_angle:.2f} is closest to option {closest_choice}: {options[closest_choice]}.\")\n\ncalculate_photon_angle()\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 57\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the careful points needed for an accurate solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves particles moving at speeds where relativistic effects are significant (indicated by Lorentz factors `γ > 1`). Therefore, the solution must be based on the principles of **conservation of relativistic energy** and **conservation of relativistic momentum**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Initial Energy of the System:**\n    The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   **Electron (e⁻):** Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Its energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):** Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Its energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`. (The positron has the same rest mass as the electron, `m_e`).\n    *   **Total Initial Energy (`E_initial`):** The total energy is the scalar sum of the individual energies.\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Initial Momentum of the System:**\n    The magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity, so direction is crucial.\n    *   Let's define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n    *   **Electron's Momentum (`p_e`):** `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15`.\n    *   **Positron's Momentum (`p_p`):** The positron moves in the opposite direction (negative x-direction). Its momentum is `p_p = -m_e c√(2² - 1) = -m_e c√3`.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (`P_initial`):** The total momentum is the vector sum. Since both particles move along the horizontal axis, we sum their momenta:\n        `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n    *   The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons):**\n    The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons.\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. The problem states they have equal energy (`E_γ`).\n        `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n        Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle:**\n    The total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   **Vertical Momentum (y-direction):** The initial vertical momentum was zero. Therefore, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the two photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles relative to the horizontal axis to cancel their vertical momentum components. Let this angle be `θ`.\n    *   **Horizontal Momentum (x-direction):** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`.\n    The term `m_e c` cancels from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n    Now, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using a calculator: `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   **Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated angle is approximately 138.2°. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 74\n    B) 96\n    C) 172\n    D) 138\n    The calculated value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe physical principles and mathematical steps have been thoroughly verified.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy of the electron (`γ=4`) and positron (`γ=2`) is `E_initial = (4 + 2)m_e c² = 6m_e c²`. This energy is transferred to two photons of equal energy, so each photon has `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total initial momentum along the horizontal axis is `P_initial = (√[4²-1] - √[2²-1])m_e c = (√15 - √3)m_e c`. The final momentum is carried by the two photons. If `θ` is the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis, the final horizontal momentum is `P_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`. Since `p_γ = E_γ/c = 3m_e c`, we have `P_final = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle:** Equating initial and final momentum gives `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`. This simplifies to `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** The angle *between* the photons is `2θ`. The code execution confirmed that `2θ = 2 * arccos((√15 - √3) / 6) ≈ 138.19°`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value of `138.19°` is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and the calculation method.

My decision is based on a careful, step-by-step re-derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Physical Principles**\n    The problem involves particles moving at speeds where relativistic effects are significant (as indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1). Therefore, the solution must be derived from the principles of **conservation of relativistic energy** and **conservation of relativistic momentum**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Initial Energy of the System**\n    The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4m_e c²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2m_e c²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the scalar sum of the individual energies:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Initial Momentum of the System**\n    The magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from left) as the positive x-direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15` (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron: `p_p = m_e c√(2² - 1) = m_e c√3`. Since it moves from the right, its momentum is in the -x direction.\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum. As the motion is purely along the x-axis, the net momentum is:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)m_e c`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n    The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    *   **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons.\n        `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n        This gives the energy of each photon as `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum**: The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n        `p_γ = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n    The total momentum of the system is conserved. The initial momentum was entirely in the horizontal (+x) direction. Therefore, the final momentum must also be entirely in the +x direction. For the vertical components of the photons' momenta to cancel, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ` and `-θ`) relative to the horizontal axis. The angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    We can simplify the equation by canceling the `m_e c` term from both sides.\n    *   `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`\n    *   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   Numerically, `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   **Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas**: The use of relativistic formulas for energy and momentum is non-negotiable and was correctly identified by most candidate answers.\n*   **Vector vs. Scalar**: Energy is a scalar and is simply added. Momentum is a vector, and its direction must be accounted for, leading to the subtraction `(√15 - √3)`.\n*   **Symmetry**: The problem's conditions (equal photon energies, initial momentum only on the horizontal axis) dictate a symmetric final state, which simplifies the momentum conservation calculation.\n*   **Final Angle**: A common pitfall is to solve for `θ` and forget to multiply by 2 to find the angle *between* the photons.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option**: The calculation consistently yields `~138.2°`. The final step is to match this to the given options: A) 172, B) 138, C) 96, D) 74. The value `138.2°` is clearly represented by option B.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, synthesizing the correct logic presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Define the System and Calculate Total Initial Energy\nThe system consists of an electron and a positron. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron:** Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Its energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n*   **Positron:** Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Its energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Initial Momentum\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. We will define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** `p_e = +m_e c√(4² - 1) = +√15 m_e c`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e c√(2² - 1) = -√3 m_e c`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The total momentum is the vector sum. Since the motion is entirely along the x-axis, we sum the components:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)\nAfter annihilation, the initial energy and momentum are transferred to two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The problem states the two photons have equal energy, `E_γ`. The total final energy must equal the total initial energy:\n    `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = E_final` → `6m_e c² = 2E_γ`.\n    Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. Therefore, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is:\n    `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe total momentum must be conserved.\n*   **Vertical (y-axis) Momentum:** The initial vertical momentum was zero. To conserve this, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle `θ`. The total angle between the photons is therefore `2θ`.\n*   **Horizontal (x-axis) Momentum:** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n    `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the Angle\nSubstitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n`(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n\nThe term `m_e c` cancels from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n\nNow, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator:\n`√15 ≈ 3.873`\n`√3 ≈ 1.732`\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nNow we find the angle `θ`:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`:\n**Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.2°.

Analyze the Final State (Two Photons) and Apply Conservation Laws\nThe initial particles annihilate into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n    `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ = E_initial = 6m_e c²`.\n    Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Momentum of a Photon:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Thus, the momentum magnitude of each photon is `p_γ = 3m_e c`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was purely in the horizontal (x) direction. To conserve momentum, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ` and `-θ`) relative to the horizontal axis. The total angle between them is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta: `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n\n### 5.

The core steps are:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy of the electron (`γ=4`) and positron (`γ=2`) is calculated as `E_initial = (4 + 2)m_e c² = 6m_e c²`. This energy is equally distributed between the two resulting photons, so each photon has an energy of `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The total initial momentum along the horizontal axis is calculated as `P_initial = (sqrt(4² - 1) - sqrt(2² - 1))m_e c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_e c`. The momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`. To conserve momentum, the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ`) relative to the horizontal axis. The final horizontal momentum is `P_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle**: By equating initial and final momentum (`P_initial = P_final`), we get the equation:\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_e c = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**: The angle between the two photons is `2θ`.

Therefore, the total final energy is `E_final = 2E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = 2E_γ`  =>  `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Photon Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n    `p_γ = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n**4. Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\nThe total initial momentum was non-zero and purely in the horizontal (+x) direction. Therefore, the final momentum must also be purely horizontal.\n\n*   For the vertical components of momentum to cancel, the two photons (which have equal momentum magnitude) must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`. The total angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n*   The final horizontal momentum (`P_final`) is the sum of the horizontal components of the two photon momenta:\n    `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final`  =>  `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\nWe can simplify the equation by canceling the `m_e c` term from both sides.\n\n*   `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n*   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `√15 ≈ 3.873`\n    *   `√3 ≈ 1.732`\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    **Total Angle = 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Vector vs. Scalar:** Energy is a scalar and adds directly. Momentum is a vector, and since the particles move in opposite directions, their momenta are subtracted to find the net momentum.\n*   **Symmetry:** The fact that the photons have equal energy and the initial momentum is purely horizontal dictates that the photons must be emitted symmetrically around the horizontal axis.\n*   **Half Angle vs. Full Angle:** The angle `θ` derived from the `cos(θ)` calculation is the angle of one photon relative to the axis of initial motion. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Final Answer:** The calculated angle is approximately 138.2°. This value corresponds to the numerical option 138.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity. I will first derive the formula for the angle between the photons based on the initial conditions and then use Python to perform the numerical calculation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron, given by `E = γmc²`.\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision is the vector sum of the relativistic momenta of the two particles, given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta will be subtracted.\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:** After annihilation, two photons are produced. By energy conservation, the initial energy is split equally between the two photons. The momentum of each photon is then `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n4.  **Apply Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum must equal the final momentum. The final momentum is the vector sum of the two photon momenta. Since the initial momentum is purely horizontal, the photons must be emitted at symmetric angles (`θ` and `-θ`) to the horizontal axis. The final horizontal momentum is `2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:** By equating the initial and final momentum, I will derive an expression for `cos(θ)`.

The problem states they have equal energy (`E_γ`).\n        `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n        Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. The magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle:**\n    The total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   **Vertical Momentum (y-direction):** The initial vertical momentum was zero. Therefore, the final vertical momentum must also be zero. Since the two photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles relative to the horizontal axis to cancel their vertical momentum components. Let this angle be `θ`.\n    *   **Horizontal Momentum (x-direction):** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`.\n    The term `m_e c` cancels from both sides:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`.\n    Now, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using a calculator: `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   **Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated angle is approximately 138.2°. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 74\n    B) 96\n    C) 172\n    D) 138\n    The calculated value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe physical principles and mathematical steps have been thoroughly verified.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy of the electron (`γ=4`) and positron (`γ=2`) is `E_initial = (4 + 2)m_e c² = 6m_e c²`. This energy is transferred to two photons of equal energy, so each photon has `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total initial momentum along the horizontal axis is `P_initial = (√[4²-1] - √[2²-1])m_e c = (√15 - √3)m_e c`. The final momentum is carried by the two photons. If `θ` is the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis, the final horizontal momentum is `P_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`. Since `p_γ = E_γ/c = 3m_e c`, we have `P_final = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle:** Equating initial and final momentum gives `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`. This simplifies to `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** The angle *between* the photons is `2θ`.

Therefore, the solution must be derived from the principles of **conservation of relativistic energy** and **conservation of relativistic momentum**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Initial Energy of the System**\n    The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`γ_e = 4`): `E_e = 4m_e c²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`γ_p = 2`): `E_p = 2m_e c²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the scalar sum of the individual energies:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Initial Momentum of the System**\n    The magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from left) as the positive x-direction.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15` (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron: `p_p = m_e c√(2² - 1) = m_e c√3`. Since it moves from the right, its momentum is in the -x direction.\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum. As the motion is purely along the x-axis, the net momentum is:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)m_e c`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n    The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    *   **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons.\n        `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n        This gives the energy of each photon as `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum**: The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n        `p_γ = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n    The total momentum of the system is conserved. The initial momentum was entirely in the horizontal (+x) direction. Therefore, the final momentum must also be entirely in the +x direction. For the vertical components of the photons' momenta to cancel, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ` and `-θ`) relative to the horizontal axis. The angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    We can simplify the equation by canceling the `m_e c` term from both sides.\n    *   `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`\n    *   `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n    *   Numerically, `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   **Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Relativistic Formulas**: The use of relativistic formulas for energy and momentum is non-negotiable and was correctly identified by most candidate answers.\n*   **Vector vs. Scalar**: Energy is a scalar and is simply added. Momentum is a vector, and its direction must be accounted for, leading to the subtraction `(√15 - √3)`.\n*   **Symmetry**: The problem's conditions (equal photon energies, initial momentum only on the horizontal axis) dictate a symmetric final state, which simplifies the momentum conservation calculation.\n*   **Final Angle**: A common pitfall is to solve for `θ` and forget to multiply by 2 to find the angle *between* the photons.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option**: The calculation consistently yields `~138.2°`. The final step is to match this to the given options: A) 172, B) 138, C) 96, D) 74. The value `138.2°` is clearly represented by option B.

Application of Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial momentum was purely horizontal (in the +x direction), the final momentum must also be.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, synthesizing the correct logic presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Define the System and Calculate Total Initial Energy\nThe system consists of an electron and a positron. The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron:** Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Its energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n*   **Positron:** Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Its energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual energies:\n    `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Initial Momentum\nThe magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. We will define the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right) as the positive x-direction.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** `p_e = +m_e c√(4² - 1) = +√15 m_e c`.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e c√(2² - 1) = -√3 m_e c`.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum:** The total momentum is the vector sum. Since the motion is entirely along the x-axis, we sum the components:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n    The initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)\nAfter annihilation, the initial energy and momentum are transferred to two photons.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The problem states the two photons have equal energy, `E_γ`. The total final energy must equal the total initial energy:\n    `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`.\n    `E_initial = E_final` → `6m_e c² = 2E_γ`.\n    Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum:** For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. Therefore, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is:\n    `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle\nThe total momentum must be conserved.\n*   **Vertical (y-axis) Momentum:** The initial vertical momentum was zero. To conserve this, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle `θ`. The total angle between the photons is therefore `2θ`.\n*   **Horizontal (x-axis) Momentum:** The initial horizontal momentum must equal the final horizontal momentum. The final horizontal momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n    `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final horizontal momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the Angle\nSubstitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the momentum conservation equation:\n`(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n\nThe term `m_e c` cancels from both sides:\n`√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n\nNow, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can use a calculator:\n`√15 ≈ 3.873`\n`√3 ≈ 1.732`\n`cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n\nNow we find the angle `θ`:\n`θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`:\n**Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.2°.

Identify the Governing Physical Principles\nThe problem involves a high-speed collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron. The Lorentz factors (`γ=4` and `γ=2`) indicate that the particles are moving at relativistic speeds.

Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from the left) as the positive x-direction.\n*   Momentum of the electron (`p_e`): `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15`.\n*   Momentum of the positron (`p_p`): It moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. `p_p = -m_e c√(2² - 1) = -m_e c√3`.\n*   The total initial momentum (`P_initial`) is the vector sum, which is entirely along the x-axis:\n    `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\nThis calculation is also performed correctly and consistently across the candidate answers.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons) and Apply Conservation Laws\nThe initial particles annihilate into two photons of equal energy (`E_γ`).\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n    `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ = E_initial = 6m_e c²`.\n    Solving for the energy of a single photon gives `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n*   **Momentum of a Photon:** The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`. Thus, the momentum magnitude of each photon is `p_γ = 3m_e c`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was purely in the horizontal (x) direction. To conserve momentum, the vertical (y) components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitudes, they must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ` and `-θ`) relative to the horizontal axis. The total angle between them is `2θ`.\n*   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta: `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n*   Equating initial and final momentum:\n    `P_initial = P_final_x`\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n\n### 5.

The core steps are:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy of the electron (`γ=4`) and positron (`γ=2`) is calculated as `E_initial = (4 + 2)m_e c² = 6m_e c²`. This energy is equally distributed between the two resulting photons, so each photon has an energy of `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: The total initial momentum along the horizontal axis is calculated as `P_initial = (sqrt(4² - 1) - sqrt(2² - 1))m_e c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_e c`. The momentum of each photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`. To conserve momentum, the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (`θ`) relative to the horizontal axis. The final horizontal momentum is `P_final = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Solving for the Angle**: By equating initial and final momentum (`P_initial = P_final`), we get the equation:\n    `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_e c = 6m_e c * cos(θ)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**: The angle between the two photons is `2θ`. The Python code executed in the previous step calculated this value precisely:\n    `2θ = 2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6) ≈ 138.19°`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated angle is approximately 138.2°.

An analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method, but some confusion in selecting the final lettered option.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\n    The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the particle's rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The electron has a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`, so its energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   The positron has a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`, so its energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   The total initial energy of the system is the sum of these two energies:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\n    The magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = mc√(γ² - 1)`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from left) as the positive x-direction.\n    *   The electron's momentum is `p_e = m_e c√(4² - 1) = m_e c√15`.\n    *   The positron moves in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative: `p_p = -m_e c√(2² - 1) = -m_e c√3`.\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which is entirely along the x-axis:\n        `P_initial = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n    The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy.\n    *   **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy must equal the total final energy. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons (`2E_γ`).\n        `E_initial = E_final`  =>  `6m_e c² = 2E_γ`\n        This means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum**: The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by `p = E/c`. Therefore, the momentum magnitude of each photon is:\n        `p_γ = E_γ / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n4.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**\n    The total momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial momentum was entirely in the positive x-direction. This means the vertical (y-direction) components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out.

The angle *between* the photons is `2θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta:\n        `P_final_x = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    Substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_e c` into the equation:\n    `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2(3m_e c)cos(θ)`\n    The term `m_e c` cancels from both sides, leaving:\n    `√15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)`\n    Solving for `cos(θ)`:\n    `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation**\n    Using the approximate values `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n    `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    Now, we find `θ` by taking the arccosine:\n    `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`:\n    **Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Mechanics**: It is crucial to use the formulas for energy and momentum from special relativity. Classical formulas would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Vector Nature of Momentum**: Momentum is a vector. The initial momenta of the electron and positron are in opposite directions and must be subtracted to find the net momentum of the system.\n*   **Symmetry of the Final State**: The conservation of momentum in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the initial motion) requires the photons to be emitted at symmetric angles, as their energies and momentum magnitudes are equal.\n*   **Definition of the Angle**: The calculation first yields `θ`, the angle of one photon relative to the axis of collision. The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The calculated value of ~138.2° is highly consistent across all provided candidate answers that show their work, indicating a high degree of confidence in the result.

Therefore, the conservation of relativistic energy and relativistic momentum must be applied.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:** The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   The electron has a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.

Let's call this angle `θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta: `P_final = p_γ cos(θ) + p_γ cos(θ) = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum:\n        `P_initial = P_final`  =>  `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2p_γ cos(θ)`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle:** We can now substitute the value of `p_γ` and solve for the angle.\n    *   `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`.\n    *   The term `m_e c` cancels from both sides, leaving: `√15 - √3 = 6 cos(θ)`.\n    *   Solving for `cos(θ)`: `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Using a calculator, `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n    *   Total Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields an angle of approximately 138.2°. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 172\nB) 74\nC) 96\nD) 138\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 138. An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while there is confusion in matching the result to the correct letter, there is a strong consensus on the calculation itself, which robustly points to 138 degrees as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the candidate answers and a first-principles re-evaluation of the physics problem, the following step-by-step solution is derived.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Governing Physical Principles**: The problem involves particles moving at speeds where relativistic effects are significant (as indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1). Therefore, the solution must be based on the principles of **conservation of relativistic energy** and **conservation of relativistic momentum**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy**: The relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`E_e`): With `γ_e = 4`, the energy is `E_e = 4m_e c²`.\n    *   Energy of the positron (`E_p`): With `γ_p = 2`, the energy is `E_p = 2m_e c²`.\n    *   The total initial energy (`E_initial`) is the sum of the two:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum**: The magnitude of a relativistic particle's momentum is given by `p = √(γ² - 1)mc`. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's define the electron's direction of motion (from left) as the positive x-axis.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (`p_e`): `p_e = √(4² - 1)m_e c = √15 m_e c` (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron (`p_p`): `p_p = √(2² - 1)m_e c = √3 m_e c`. Since it moves from the right, its momentum is in the -x direction.\n    *   The total initial momentum (`P_initial`) is the vector sum. As the motion is purely along the x-axis, we sum the components:\n        `P_initial = (√15 - √3)m_e c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**: The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy.\n    *   **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the two photons.\n        `E_final = E_initial` => `2 * E_photon = 6m_e c²`.\n        This means the energy of each photon is `E_photon = 3m_e c²`.\n    *   **Photon Momentum**: For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E = pc`. The magnitude of each photon's momentum is therefore:\n        `p_photon = E_photon / c = 3m_e c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Momentum Conservation to Find the Angle**: The total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   The initial momentum was entirely in the positive x-direction. Therefore, the final momentum must also be entirely in the positive x-direction.\n    *   For the vertical (y-direction) momentum to be conserved (from zero to zero), the two photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles relative to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be `θ`.\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photon momenta: `P_final_x = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(θ) = 2p_photon * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n        `P_initial = P_final_x`\n        `(√15 - √3)m_e c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Angle**: We can simplify the equation to find `θ`.\n    *   The term `m_e c` cancels from both sides: `√15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Solving for `cos(θ)`: `cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6`.\n    *   Using numerical values: `√15 ≈ 3.873` and `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n        `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`.\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n        **Total Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Mechanics**: The high Lorentz factors necessitate the use of relativistic formulas for energy and momentum. Classical formulas would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Vector Nature of Momentum**: It is crucial to treat momentum as a vector. The initial momenta of the electron and positron are in opposite directions, so their magnitudes are subtracted to find the net momentum of the system.\n*   **Symmetry in the Final State**: The conservation of momentum in the direction perpendicular to the initial motion, combined with the fact that the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude), dictates that they must be emitted at symmetric angles.\n*   **Final Angle**: The calculated angle `θ` is the angle of each photon relative to the axis of initial motion. The question asks for the total angle *between* the photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   **Matching to Options**: The calculated value of ~138.2° must be compared to the given options. It matches the value of 138.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation across a vast majority of the provided answers, as well as the independent analysis above, consistently and unambiguously yields a result of approximately 138.2°.
