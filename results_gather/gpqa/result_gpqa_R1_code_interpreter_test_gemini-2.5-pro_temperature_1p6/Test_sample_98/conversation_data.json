    "**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present but does not help differentiate between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThis is the key to differentiating the isomers. We are given information about two specific signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex splitting pattern tells us about the neighbors of a specific proton. According to the n+1 rule:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 adjacent, equivalent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 adjacent, equivalent protons (i.e., a methyl group, -CH₃) (n=3).\n    Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a `CH` proton that has a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group as neighbors. The most common arrangement for this would be a proton on a carbon that is also attached to a methyl group, and this carbon is between a `CH₂` group and a `CH` group. The fragment looks like this: `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH-`.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    Using the same logic:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to 1 adjacent proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to 2 adjacent protons.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of 2 adjacent protons.\n    Therefore, the proton giving this signal must be a `CH` proton that is adjacent to one `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups. The fragment could look like this: `-CH₂-CH(CH₂...)-CH-`.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if its structure can produce both of these signals. We'll determine the IUPAC name for each structure to be clear.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\n    *   Proton at C3: This is a `CH`. It is adjacent to H2 (`CH`), C4 (`CH₂`), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group. It is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 2H. This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that fits the criteria for a `dtq` (no `CH` proton is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, *and* a `CH₃` group).\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-COOH`\n    *   Proton at C3: This is a `CH`. It is adjacent to H2 (`CH`), C4 (`CH₂`), and is on a carbon bearing a methyl group (`CH₃`). It is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H. This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that fits the criteria for a `dtt` (no `CH` is neighbored by a `CH` and two different `CH₂` groups).\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(Me)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   Proton at C3: This is a `CH`. It is adjacent to H4 (`CH`), C2 (`CH₂`), and is on a carbon with a methyl group. This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton that would give a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The line formula is best interpreted as `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's determine the IUPAC name and structure. The longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group is a pentanoic acid backbone.\n    Structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(Et)(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    Let's analyze the key protons in this structure:\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This is a `CH` proton. Its neighbors are:\n        *   The proton on C3 (a `CH` group) → **doublet (d)**\n        *   The protons on C5 (a `CH₃` group) → **quartet (q)**\n        *   The protons on the C4-ethyl group (`CH₂`) → **triplet (t)**\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which has the same multiplicity (2x4x3=24 lines) and components as a `dtq`. It perfectly fits the first signal description.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This is also a `CH` proton. Its neighbors are:\n        *   The proton on C4 (a `CH` group) → **doublet (d)**\n        *   The protons on C2 (a `CH₂` group) → **triplet (t)**\n        *   The protons on the C3-ethyl group (`CH₂`) → **triplet (t)**\n        This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly fits the second signal description.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons that would generate both a `dtq` (or `dqt`) and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
