    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\nThe integration values for the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\nTotal number of protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of protons in the candidate molecules.**\nLet's find the molecular formulas and proton counts for the general structures of propenyl acetate and butenyl acetate.\n*   **Propenyl acetate**: The propenyl group is C3H5, and the acetate group (CH3COO-) is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 protons. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate**: The butenyl group is C4H7, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 protons.\n\nSince the unknown compound has 8 protons, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 3: Choose between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.**\nThe remaining options are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. To distinguish between these two isomers, we need to analyze the structure and coupling constants.\n\nThe structure of 1-propenyl acetate is:\nCH3(d)-CH(c)=CH(b)-O-C(=O)-CH3(a)\n\nLet's assign the signals from the provided data to the protons in this structure:\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons. This corresponds perfectly to the acetate methyl group, CH3(a), which has no adjacent protons to couple with. The chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is typical for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (C=O).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet for 3 protons. This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond, CH3(d). It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(c). The chemical shift of ~1.6 ppm is typical for an allylic methyl group.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a signal for 1 proton which is a doublet of quartets. This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(c). It is coupled to the other vinylic proton H(b), causing the doublet splitting. It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(d), causing the quartet splitting.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet for 1 proton. This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b). It is coupled only to the other vinylic proton, H(c), resulting in a doublet. Its high chemical shift (deshielded) is due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n**Step 4: Use the coupling constant (J) to determine the stereochemistry.**\nThe key piece of information to distinguish between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c). The problem states that the signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz.\n*   For **trans** isomers (where the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond), the vicinal coupling constant (³J_HH) is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n*   For **cis** isomers (where the protons are on the same side of the double bond), the vicinal coupling constant (³J_HH) is smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe observed J value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the proton count, the fragmentation pattern (singlet, doublet, doublet of quartets), and especially the large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
