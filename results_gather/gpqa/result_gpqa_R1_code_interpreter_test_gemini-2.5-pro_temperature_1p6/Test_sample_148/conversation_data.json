    "This is a classic problem in the chemical analysis of synthetic peptides. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step and evaluate each possible explanation.\n\n**The Evidence:**\n\n1.  **Molecule Type:** It's a peptidic compound, meaning it has amide bonds. This is a crucial piece of information because amide bonds have special properties.\n2.  **Â¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two peaks for one alpha-proton:** This indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **Similar chemical shifts:** The two environments are very similar, but not identical.\n    *   **Roughly equal integrals:** The two species exist in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Spin-spin coupling ruled out:** The splitting is not due to coupling with adjacent protons.\n3.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Two separable peaks:** Liquid chromatography (LC) can separate the two species. This means they are distinct molecules with different physical properties (like polarity), not just an artifact of the NMR experiment.\n    *   **Equal intensities:** Confirms the ~1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n    *   **Same mass spectrum:** Both species have the exact same molecular weight. This is a critical point.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The LC-MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass*, which is consistent with the *expected molecule*. This option is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is not a standard term, but any side reaction that involves adding another molecule (like another amino acid) would result in a product with a different, higher molecular weight. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical NMR spectra. You would only see one peak for the alpha-proton, not two.\n    *   **LC:** Standard (achiral) liquid chromatography cannot separate enantiomers. You would see a single peak in the chromatogram.\n    *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. It is expected to see two different sets of peaks for a mixture of two diastereomers. The observation of two peaks for the same proton is a classic sign of a diastereomeric mixture.\n    *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The observation of two separate LC peaks is perfectly consistent with this.\n    *   **MS:** Diastereomers have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. The observation that both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum is exactly what would be expected.\n\n**What kind of diastereomers?**\nIn peptide chemistry, there are two very common ways diastereomers are formed:\n1.  **Rotamers (Conformational Isomers):** The amide bond (C-N) has significant double-bond character due to resonance. This restricts rotation, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are diastereomers, they interconvert slowly, and are often observed as separate species in NMR and can sometimes be separated by LC. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for peptide bonds involving the amino acid proline.\n2.  **Epimers:** During synthesis, particularly during the amide bond formation step (coupling), the chiral center of the amino acid (the alpha-carbon) can sometimes racemize or epimerize. This means a peptide that was supposed to be made of all L-amino acids might now contain some D-amino acid at one position, creating a diastereomer (e.g., L-Ala-L-Val vs. D-Ala-L-Val).\n\nBoth of these scenarios result in a mixture of diastereomers, and both perfectly explain all the analytical data provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of two separable species by LC that have identical masses but give distinct NMR signals is the definitive signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<D>>>"
