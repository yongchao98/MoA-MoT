    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its momentum is zero.\n    *   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments, let's call their rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`. No other particles are created.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `p1 = -p2`, so `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n        *   `E_initial = E_final`\n        *   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n        *   This can be rearranged to find the total kinetic energy released (the Q-value of the reaction): `T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Masses and Q-value:**\n    *   We are given `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   In terms of energy: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy released is `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   We are also told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   We can now find the individual rest-mass energies:\n        *   `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        *   `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n        *   `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`\n        *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n        *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-relativistic) Mechanics:**\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since the momenta `p` are equal in magnitude for both fragments:\n        *   `T1_cla = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n        *   `T2_cla = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n    *   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: `T1_cla / T2_cla = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n    *   So, `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy:\n        *   `T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`\n        *   `T1_cla + 2*T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n        *   `3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n        *   `T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics:**\n    *   The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n    *   Substituting for `E`: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Expanding this gives: `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Simplifying, we get the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n    *   Since `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n        *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n    *   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. We can substitute this and the mass-energies (in GeV) into the equation:\n        *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n        *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n        *   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides: `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n        *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n        *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n        *   `600 * T1 = 603`\n        *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy: `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_cla`\n    *   Difference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation is performed using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus in GeV\nE_initial_GeV = 300.0\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# Final sum of rest-mass energies of the two fragments\nE_final_rest_GeV = 0.99 * E_initial_GeV\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy released) in GeV\nQ_GeV = E_initial_GeV - E_final_rest_GeV\n\n# Let m1 be the more massive fragment and m2 be the less massive one.\n# m1 = 2 * m2  =>  m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n# m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = E_final_rest_GeV\n# 3 * m2*c^2 = E_final_rest_GeV\nm2_c2_GeV = E_final_rest_GeV / 3.0\nm1_c2_GeV = 2.0 * m2_c2_GeV\n\n# 1.

Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` and mass `m` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal for both fragments:\n    *   `T1_cla = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n    *   `T2_cla = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of masses:\n    *   `T1_cla / T2_cla = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2` => `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n    *   `T1_cla + T2_cla = Q`\n    *   `T1_cla + (2 * T1_cla) = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**4. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\n*   In special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`.\n*   We can write this as `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`. Since total energy `E = T + mc^2`, we have `(pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we can set their squared values equal:\n    *   `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)`\n*   Substitute `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`, `m1c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV` (all energies in GeV):\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    *   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600*T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n    *   `T1_correct = 1005 MeV`\n\n**5.
