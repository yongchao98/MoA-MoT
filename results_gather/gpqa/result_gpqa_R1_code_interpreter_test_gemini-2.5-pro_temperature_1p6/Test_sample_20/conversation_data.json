    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules, known as tautomers, rapidly interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) from an alpha-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a pi bond. A necessary condition for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one alpha-hydrogen.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**:\n    *   **Structure**: It's a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   **Alpha-carbons**: The carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl (C=O) groups are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens**: These alpha-carbons are each bonded to two other carbon atoms and have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   **Structure**: It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-carbons**: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons, as they are adjacent to carbonyl groups. For instance, C-2 is alpha to both C-1 and C-3 carbonyls.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens**: Each of these alpha-carbons (C-2, C-4, C-6) has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is aromatic and extremely stable, meaning the equilibrium lies heavily on the side of the enol tautomer.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center**: Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. It is attached to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since the C-2 atom is a chiral center and the molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry (like a plane or center of symmetry), it is chiral. Chiral molecules exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene dicarboxylate: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center**: There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups each.\n    *   **Overall Chirality**: The molecule is essentially planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point in the center of the C=C bond). A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   **Compound A** (no tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   **Compound B** (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
