    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines or amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for a conjugated ester. It's too high for a typical conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). This is a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group (3+1=4 peaks). This is a methylene (-CH₂) group. The high chemical shift (deshielded) at 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen.\n*   **Combining these two signals (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):** They form an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH₂CH₃), which is the structure of an ethoxy group within an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is very characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH₂), which confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH₂). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, suggesting they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester -COOR).\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Ruled out.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, not two. Ruled out.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate moiety (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. Ruled out.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester C=O.\n    *   **1H NMR:** Contains an ethyl ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃), giving the quartet at 4.5 ppm and the triplet at 1.20 ppm. Contains a primary amine (-NH₂) giving the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. It has a 1,4-disubstituted ring with an electron-donating group (-NH₂) and an electron-withdrawing group (-COOEt), which produces the characteristic two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that fits all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
