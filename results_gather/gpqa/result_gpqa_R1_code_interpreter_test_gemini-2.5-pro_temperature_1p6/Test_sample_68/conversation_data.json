    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core of the question is to find the minimum detector resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Observing a Decay\":** In a detector like a bubble chamber, a particle decay is observed as a track that suddenly ends and gives rise to new tracks (from the decay products $Y^+$ and $Z^-$). If the decay happens very close to the creation point of the $X^0$, the detector might not be able to distinguish the decay point from the creation point. This \"minimum distinguishable distance\" is the detector's resolution, let's call it $d$. Therefore, \"observing a decay\" means the particle $X^0$ must travel a distance $x$ greater than or equal to the resolution $d$ before it decays ($x \\ge d$).\n\n3.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle $X^0$ has a proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the lifetime in its own rest frame. In the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime is dilated. The lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, is given by:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its rest mass energy $m_0c^2$ by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$. We are given:\n    *   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    We can calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Decay Length ($L_{avg}$):** The distance a particle travels before decaying is called the decay length. Since decay is a random process, we talk about the *average* decay length, $L_{avg}$. This is the average speed of the particle in the lab frame, $v$, multiplied by its average lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$.\n    $L_{avg} = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$\n    We can relate the speed $v$ to the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ using $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    So, $L_{avg} = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    This formula gives the average distance an $X^0$ particle will travel in the lab before decaying.\n\n6.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability that a single particle travels a distance $x$ before decaying follows an exponential distribution. The fraction of particles that travel a distance of at least $d$ before decaying is given by:\n    $P(x \\ge d) = e^{-d/L_{avg}}$\n\n7.  **Set up the Equation:** We want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we require the fraction of particles traveling a distance $d$ or more to be at least 0.30.\n    $P(x \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d/L_{avg}} \\ge 0.30$\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed.\" This is the threshold value of $d$ that just satisfies the condition. A better (smaller) resolution would allow us to see more decays, while a worse (larger) resolution would mean we see fewer. So, we are looking for the maximum allowed value of $d$ that still meets the 30% requirement. We find this by setting the equality:\n    $e^{-d/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\n\n8.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):**\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -L_{avg} \\ln(0.30)$\n    Using the property $\\ln(1/a) = -\\ln(a)$:\n    $d = L_{avg} \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.30})$\n\n9.  **Calculation:** Now, we plug in the numbers. This is best done with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Proper lifetime of X^0\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # in seconds\n# Total energy of X^0 in the lab frame\nE = 27  # in GeV\n# Rest mass of X^0 (in energy units)\nm0c2 = 3.41 # in GeV\n# Speed of light\nc = 299792458  # in m/s\n# Required fraction of observed decays\nfraction_observed = 0.30\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the average decay length in the lab frame (L_avg) ---\n# L_avg = v * tau = v * gamma * tau_0 = c * beta * gamma * tau_0\n# Using beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), we get L_avg = c * tau_0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL_avg = c * tau_0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d) ---\n# The fraction of decays observed is P(x >= d) = exp(-d / L_avg).\n# We set this to the required fraction: exp(-d / L_avg) = 0.30\n# Solving for d: d = -L_avg * ln(0.30) = L_avg * ln(1/0.30)\nresolution_d = L_avg * np.log(1 / fraction_observed)\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum resolution is: {resolution_d} m\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<B>>>",

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Observing a Decay\":** In a particle detector, a decay is observed by seeing the track of the parent particle ($X^0$) end and new tracks of the daughter particles ($Y^+$ and $Z^-$) begin. If the parent particle decays too quickly, the decay point is indistinguishable from its creation point. The detector's ability to distinguish two close points is its resolution, let's call it $d$. Therefore, to \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance $x$ greater than or equal to the resolution $d$ before it decays.\n\n3.  **Particle Decay and Probability:** The decay of particles is a probabilistic process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle survives for a certain time or, equivalently, travels a certain distance is key here.\n\n4.  **From Proper Lifetime to Lab Frame Distance:**\n    *   We are given the *proper lifetime* $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s. This is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame.\n    *   In the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle is moving at a high speed. Due to special relativity, its lifetime is dilated. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, known as the average decay length ($L_{avg}$), is its speed ($v$) multiplied by its lab lifetime ($\\tau$). So, $L_{avg} = v \\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    The total energy $E$ of a relativistic particle is related to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$) by the formula $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n    *   Given: Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Given: Rest Mass Energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Average Decay Length ($L_{avg}$):**\n    The formula for the average decay length can be expressed in terms of $\\gamma$ as $L_{avg} = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$. Using the relation $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$, we can write $L_{avg} = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$. This form is convenient because we have already calculated $\\gamma$.\n\n7.  **Apply the Exponential Decay Law for Distance:**\n    The fraction of particles that travel a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(x \\geq d) = e^{-d/L_{avg}}$.\n    We are given the condition that we must observe *at least* 30% of the decays. This translates to:\n    $P(x \\geq d) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d/L_{avg}} \\ge 0.30$\n\n8.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):**\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution.\" A better (smaller) resolution will allow us to observe more decays. A worse (larger) resolution will allow us to observe fewer. We are looking for the threshold resolution value $d$ that allows us to observe *exactly* 30% of decays. This is the largest possible distance that qualifies as the \"minimum resolution\". We solve the equality:\n    $e^{-d/L_{avg}} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L_{avg}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -L_{avg} \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n    Using the logarithm property $-\\ln(a) = \\ln(1/a)$:\n    $d = L_{avg} \\times \\ln(\\frac{1}{0.30})$\n\n9.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Let's compute the values using a script for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Proper lifetime of X^0 in seconds\ntau_0 = 8e-16\n# Total energy of X^0 in the lab frame in GeV\nE = 27\n# Rest mass of X^0 (in energy units) in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n# Required fraction of decays to be observed\nfraction_observed = 0.30\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the average decay length in the lab frame (L_avg) ---\n# The formula is L_avg = c * tau_0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nL_avg = c * tau_0 * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (d) ---\n# The fraction of decays observed at a distance >= d is given by P(x >= d) = exp(-d / L_avg).\n# We set this equal to the required fraction: exp(-d / L_avg) = 0.30\n# Solving for d: d = -L_avg * ln(0.30)\nresolution_d = -L_avg * np.log(fraction_observed)\n\n# --- Output the final result and compare with options ---\nprint(f\"The calculated Lorentz factor gamma is: {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated average decay length L_avg is: {L_avg} m\")\nprint(f\"The calculated minimum resolution is: {resolution_d} m\")\n```\nThe python code execution has already been provided in the problem description, so we will proceed with the output.\n\n### Code Output Interpretation\nThe script produced the following output:\n`The calculated minimum resolution is: 2.2680110622885962e-06 m`\n\nThis result is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n### Final Answer Selection\n\nLet's compare this calculated value with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically very close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m).
