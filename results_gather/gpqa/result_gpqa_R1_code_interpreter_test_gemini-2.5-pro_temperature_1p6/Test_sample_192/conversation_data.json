    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax (`plx`). Specifically, the number of stars *per unit of parallax*, which we can write as a density function `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`). This means we need to find the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, which is the density function `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Key Relationship:**\n    The fundamental relationship connecting distance and parallax is that they are inversely proportional. For distance `r` in parsecs and parallax `plx` in arcseconds, the formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule for Transformation:**\n    To convert the density function from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance, we can use the chain rule of calculus:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Components:**\n    We need to find the two terms on the right side of the equation and express them in terms of `r`.\n\n    *   **First term (`dN/d(plx)`):** We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`. Using the relationship `plx = 1/r`, we can substitute `1/r` for `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Second term (`d(plx)/dr`):** This is the derivative of parallax with respect to distance. We differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -r⁻²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Terms:**\n    Now substitute the two components back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-r⁻²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n7.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us how the number density of stars changes with distance. The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `r` increases, the corresponding parallax `plx` decreases. Since the number density itself must be a positive quantity, we consider its magnitude, which scales as `r³`.\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes as `~ r³`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
