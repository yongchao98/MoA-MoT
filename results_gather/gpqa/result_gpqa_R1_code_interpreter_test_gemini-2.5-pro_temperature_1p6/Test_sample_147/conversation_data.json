    "I need to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4 based on a series of chemical reactions and properties.\n\n**1. Identify Element Y**\n\nThe first step is to identify the unknown element Y.\nWe are given that a compound A2, with the formula YFₓ, has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196).\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   x is the number of fluorine atoms in the formula of A2.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (x * M(F) * (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\nM(Y) = (x * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ x * 40.45\n\nWe can test integer values for x to find plausible molar masses for Y and identify the corresponding element.\n\n*   **If x = 1**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Calcium (Ca) or Argon (Ar). These are not known to form the variety and type of reactive fluorides described.\n*   **If x = 2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol) or Selenium (Se, 79.0 g/mol). Let's check for Br: The mass fraction of F in BrF₂ would be (2 * 19) / (79.9 + 38) ≈ 0.322. Close, but bromine typically forms BrF, BrF₃, BrF₅, making the \"five binary compounds\" claim complicated.\n*   **If x = 3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's verify this.\n    *   Formula of A2 would be SbF₃.\n    *   M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   ɷF in SbF₃ = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **If x = 4**: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No stable element matches this well.\n*   **If x = 5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. Close to Mercury (Hg) or Thallium (Tl).\n*   **If x = 6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Close to Americium (Am) or Plutonium (Pu). PuF₆ is a known strong oxidizer, but its decomposition and other known fluorides do not fit the description as well as Antimony.\n\nGiven the close match, **Element Y is Antimony (Sb)**, and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**2. Identify the Compounds and Reactions**\n\nLet's use the fact that Y = Sb to identify the other substances.\n*   **Five binary compounds of fluorine with Antimony:** The most common are SbF₃ (antimony trifluoride) and SbF₅ (antimony pentafluoride). Other compounds like Sb₂F₁₁ (formed from SbF₅) exist, often in complex superacid systems. This condition is plausible for Sb.\n*   **A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂).**\n    *   Reaction: A1 → SbF₃ + F₂\n    *   This implies A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride of antimony. A likely candidate is a polymeric form of antimony tetrafluoride, (SbF₄)n, which can be viewed as Sb(III)Sb(V)F₈. A less stable, discrete SbF₄ radical or compound could decompose this way. The problem states A1 is a \"substance\", which could be this mixed-valence compound. It also fits the description of being a \"bright-red substance\".\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon.**\n    *   SbF₅ (a very strong Lewis acid) can react with XeF₂ to form salts like [XeF][Sb₂F₁₁]. A mixture of SbF₅ and F₂, or a more reactive fluoride like A1, would be a powerful enough oxidizing agent to react with Xenon directly. So, A3 is likely SbF₅, a powerful fluorinating agent.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.**\n    *   Reaction: Sb + F₂ → A3 (SbF₅). This is the standard synthesis for antimony pentafluoride.\n*   **By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.**\n    *   This is a key reaction. We have a reaction between Sb and a solution of A4 (another antimony fluoride). The \"colorless concentrated solution\" strongly suggests that A4 is dissolved in a specific solvent. The most famous use of antimony fluorides is in preparing the superacid \"Magic Acid\" (FSO₃H·SbF₅). Another solvent could be liquid HF.\n    *   A common reaction in this context is the formation of lower oxidation state complexes. However, a simpler interpretation is a reaction in an aqueous solution, specifically hydrofluoric acid (HF). Let's assume the solution is aqueous for now. A4 must be a water-soluble antimony fluoride. SbF₃ is soluble in water (though it hydrolyzes). SbF₅ reacts violently with water.\n    *   Let's reconsider the \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". This points strongly to **A4 being hydrofluoric acid (HF)**. HF is a colorless liquid/gas and is the solvent in which many fluorination reactions occur.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: Y + A4 (1:1 molar ratio) → A5. If A4=HF: Sb + HF → ? This is not a 1:1 reaction and does not typically yield a single product A5 this way.\n    *   Let's reconsider. Maybe A4 is not HF, but an antimony oxyfluoride or a complex acid formed from an antimony fluoride.\n    *   Let's look at the wording again: \"a hot colorless concentrated solution *of* A4\". This means A4 is the solute.\n    *   What if A4 is SbF₅? SbF₅ is a colorless liquid, which can act as a solvent or be dissolved in an inert solvent like HF. The reaction is: `Sb + SbF₅ → A5` (1:1 ratio). This looks like a comproportionation reaction. Adding Sb(0) to Sb(V) could produce Sb(III).\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is: **Sb + SbF₅ → 2SbF₃ (in a suitable solvent)**.\n        *   The stoichiometry is 1 Sb : 1 SbF₅, which is not what's stated. The problem says `1 Y : 1 A4`. `Y + A4 -> A5`.\n        *   What if the product is not SbF₃? Maybe it's a mixed-valence compound or an adduct.\n    *   Let's reconsider the problem statement about A5. **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.** This suggests A5 is unstable in water, likely through hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's try another possibility. A key piece of information is the five binary compounds. Let's list the known and plausible ones: SbF, SbF₃, SbF₅, and polymers or cluster ions based on these.\n    *   Let's focus on the synthesis of A5: **Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio)**.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₅, we have Sb + SbF₅ → A5. The product A5 must have a formula like Sb₂F₅.\n        *   If A4 = SbF₃, we have Sb + SbF₃ → A5. The product A5 must have a formula like Sb₂F₃.\n    *   Now let's revisit A3. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. This typically produces the highest oxidation state fluoride, so **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   Since A3 can interact with Xenon, it must be a strong Lewis acid/oxidizer, which SbF₅ is.\n    *   What about A4? Let's reconsider the set of five compounds. A1, A2, A3, and two others. Let's assume A4 and A5 are part of these five. We have identified:\n        *   A2 = SbF₃\n        *   A3 = SbF₅\n        *   A1 = unstable higher fluoride (e.g., \"SbF₄\")\n    *   What is A4? \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF₅ is colorless. SbF₃ is a white/grey solid but forms colorless solutions. Let's try to deduce the reaction again.\n    *   `Sb(s) + A4(soln) --(1:1)--> A5(soln)`\n    *   If **A4 = SbF₅**, then `Sb + SbF₅ -> \"Sb₂F₅\"`. This is not a known stable compound. The reaction more likely proceeds as `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\n    *   If **A4 = H[SbF₆]** (Fluoroantimonic acid). This is a strong acid, one of the superacids. `Sb + H[SbF₆] -> ?` This seems unlikely.\n    *   There is a known reaction: `SbF₃ + Sb + HF(conc) -> SbF₂`. (SbF₂) is actually a polymeric substance (Sb₂F₄) where antimony has a +2 formal oxidation state. It is a colorless substance.\n    *   Let's revisit the prompt: `By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.` Let's test the hypothesis: A4 = SbF₃ and A5 = Sb₂O₃ (via hydrolysis after). This does not fit.\n    *   Let's re-read a critical sentence: **By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.** What if A4 is a compound of Y, but not a fluoride? The problem says \"Five binary compounds of *fluorine* with element Y are known.\" and all A-series substances appear to be such.\n    *   Let's focus on this comproportionation again. `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. The molar ratio of reactants is `n(Sb) : n(SbF₅) = 2 : 3`.\n    *   What about `Sb + SbF₃`? This generally doesn't react.\n    *   The problem could be referencing a more obscure reaction, or there's a simpler interpretation.\n    *   Let's reconsider Y = **Bismuth (Bi)**. M(Bi)=209. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x -> `209 ≈ 40.45 * x` -> `x ≈ 5.17`. So A2 could be BiF₅.\n        *   Let's check ɷF for BiF₅. M(BiF₅) = 209 + 5*19 = 304. ɷF = 95/304 ≈ 0.3125. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n        *   Fluorides of Bi: BiF₃, BiF₅. Bismuth subfluorides like BiF are also described. BiF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent. BiF₅ decomposes below 100°C. But it doesn't decompose into BiF₃, it decomposes to BiF₃ and F₂. No, it's synthesized from BiF₃ and F₂. It is not particularly stable. So A2=BiF₅ is not a good candidate. If A2=BiF₃, M(BiF₃) = 209 + 57 = 266. ɷF = 57/266 ≈ 0.214, which is not a match.\n    *   Let's go back to **Sb**. The identification of Y as Sb and A2 as SbF₃ seems the most solid piece of evidence. Let's trust it and work from there.\n    *   A2 = SbF₃\n    *   A3 = SbF₅\n    *   Let's re-examine `Y + A4 --(1:1)--> A5`.\n    *   Could A4 be an oxofluoride? That would contradict \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\n    *   Perhaps the information points to something formed in an HF solution. A common species formed by dissolving SbF₃ in concentrated HF is the **trifluoroantimonate(III) ion, [SbF₄]⁻**, usually as H[SbF₄]. Let's assume A4 is H[SbF₄].\n    *   Reaction: `Sb + H[SbF₄] -> ?` This is not straightforward.\n    *   Let's consider a simpler interpretation of the five compounds. Maybe they are just different established stoichiometric formulas: SbF₃, SbF₅, Sb₂F₁₁, Sb₃F₁₆ etc (referring to anions). This is getting too complex.\n\nLet's assume a simpler path.\nY = Sb\nA2 = SbF₃ (M=178.8)\nA3 = SbF₅ (M=216.8)\n\nWhat is A4?\nWhat if the question contains a small trick or refers to a standard textbook reaction that isn't immediately obvious?\n`Sb + A4 (1:1) -> A5`\n`A5 + H₂O -> \"two substances\"` (hydrolysis)\nThis hydrolysis step is typical for antimony compounds. For example, `SbF₃ + H₂O -> SbOF + 2HF`. SbOF is antimony oxyfluoride. That is two substances.\n\nLet's rethink the 1:1 reaction. Maybe the product A5 is a subfluoride.\n`Sb + SbF₃ -> 2 \"SbF₂\" (or Sb₂F₄)` -- this is 1:1.\nSo, if **A4 = SbF₃**, then **A5 = Sb₂F₄**.\nLet's check if this fits. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4(SbF₃)\". SbF₃ is soluble in hot water (with some hydrolysis) or HF. Let's assume the reaction is possible. Then A5 is Sb₂F₄.\nDoes Sb₂F₄ decompose in water to two substances? It likely hydrolyzes to give Sb(III) oxides/oxyfluorides and HF, so yes.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible path:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A2 = SbF₃\n*   A3 = SbF₅\n*   **A4 = SbF₃**\n*   A5 = Sb₂F₄ (or polymeric (SbF₂)n)\n\nLet's double check this hypothesis.\nIf A4 = SbF₃, the question asks for its molecular weight range.\nM(A4) = M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\nThis value falls into the range **160-180**.\n\nLet's try to find a flaw.\nWhat if A4 = SbF₅?\nReaction: `Sb + SbF₅ (1:1) -> A5`\nThis would make A5 = \"Sb₂F₅\". I cannot find evidence of a stable compound with this formula. The normal comproportionation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`. The ratios don't match.\n\nSo, the hypothesis that A4 = SbF₃ seems the most chemically sound based on a simple interpretation of the 1:1 molar ratio reaction as a comproportionation to a known (if less common) subfluoride.\n\nLet's verify the other points with this assignment.\n*   Five binary compounds: SbF₃ (A2/A4), SbF₅ (A3), (SbF₂)n (A5), \"SbF₄\" (A1). This leaves one more. Maybe the monomer SbF₂? Or SbF? The claim is plausible enough.\n*   A1 (e.g. Sb₂F₈) decomposes to A2(SbF₃). Reaction: Sb(III)Sb(V)F₈ → SbF₃ + SbF₅. This does not produce fluorine gas.\n*   The decomposition given is `A1 -> A2 + F₂`. So, `SbFₓ -> SbF₃ + (x-3)/2 F₂`. This means A1 is SbF₄ or SbF₅.\n    *   If A1 = SbF₅, reaction is `SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂`. This is a known thermal decomposition reaction of SbF₅, occurring at high temperatures (around 400°C), not at 293 K.\n    *   Also, A1 is bright-red. SbF₅ is colorless.\n*   There seems to be a conflict. The decomposition of A1 points to something different.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Y. What about **Krypton (Kr)** or **Rhodium (Rh)**?\n*   Y=Kr, M=83.8. `83.8 ≈ 40.45 * x` -> `x ≈ 2.07`. So A2 = KrF₂.\n    *   Let's check ɷF for KrF₂. M = 83.8 + 2*19 = 121.8. ɷF = 38/121.8 ≈ 0.312. This is close to 31.96%.\n    *   Let's check the properties.\n    *   Five binary fluorides of Kr? Only KrF₂ is well-established. KrF₄ was claimed but is likely incorrect.\n    *   A1 (higher fluoride, KrF₄?) decomposes at 293K to A2 (KrF₂) and F₂? `KrF₄ -> KrF₂ + F₂`. This is chemically plausible. KrF₄ is reported to be unstable.\n    *   A1/A3 oxidizes Xenon? KrF₂ is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent and can oxidize Xe.\n    *   A1 is bright-red? KrF₂ and KrF₄ are described as colorless solids. This is a mismatch.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Y based on the color. \"bright-red substance A1\".\nSome colorful higher fluorides include:\n*   PuF₆ (reddish-brown)\n*   RhF₆ (black solid)\n*   O₂PtF₆ (red solid, but not a binary compound of Y and F)\n*   What about **Vanadium**? VF₅ is a red liquid. But M(V) = 51. `51 ≈ 40.45 * x` -> x is not an integer.\n*   What about **Gold**? AuF₅ (dark red solid). M(Au) = 197. `197 ≈ 40.45 * x` -> `x ≈ 4.87`, close to 5.\n    *   Let's test Y = Au, A2 = AuF₅. ɷF = (5*19)/(197+95) = 95/292 ≈ 0.325. This is somewhat close.\n    *   A1 decomposes to A2(AuF₅) and F₂. A1 would be a higher fluoride like AuF₇, which is known but only as an anion [AuF₇]²⁻. Gold also forms AuF₃. AuF₅ decomposes to AuF₃ + F₂. So if A1=AuF₅, A2=AuF₃. Let's check ɷF for AuF₃. M=197+57=254. ɷF = 57/254 ≈ 0.224. Not a match.\n    *   Therefore, Y is not Au.\n\nLet's go back to **Antimony (Sb)** and reconsider the initial clues.\nMaybe there's an error in my knowledge about the color or stability. The facts given in the problem must be assumed to be true.\n1. Y = Sb, A2 = SbF₃. This is our strongest link. M(A2) = 178.8 g/mol.\n2. A1 is a bright-red binary Sb fluoride that decomposes to SbF₃ and F₂ at room temperature.\n   * `SbFₓ -> SbF₃ + F₂`. This means A1 is SbF₄ or SbF₅.\n   * SbF₅ is colorless. So maybe there is an unstable, red allotrope or an error in the problem's description. Or A1 is not SbF₅.\n   * Let's ignore the color for a moment. If `A1` is `SbF₅`, it does decompose to `SbF₃ + F₂` (albeit at higher temps than 293K). Let's assume the problem allows for this.\n3. A1 (SbF₅) oxidizes Xenon. Yes, it does (in the presence of F₂ or via Lewis acidity with XeF₂).\n4. A3 is from fluorination of Sb, so A3 = SbF₅. Thus, **A1 = A3 = SbF₅**. This seems plausible. The problem distinguishes them as A1 and A3, but they could be the same chemical substance.\n5. So, A1 = A3 = SbF₅ (antimony pentafluoride). M = 216.8 g/mol.\n6. A2 = SbF₃ (antimony trifluoride). M = 178.8 g/mol.\n7. Reaction for A5: `Y(Sb) + A4 (1:1) -> A5`. A5 decomposes in water.\n8. We need to identify A4. It's one of the five binary fluorides. We've used SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n9. What if **A4 = SbF₅**? The reaction becomes `Sb + SbF₅ -> A5`. As discussed, this doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio for any simple product.\n10. What if **A4 = SbF₃**? The reaction becomes `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`. This fits a 1:1 ratio if `A5 = \"SbF₂\" (Sb₂F₄)`. This looks plausible.\n\nTherefore, the assignment **A4 = SbF₃** remains the most logical choice despite the minor discrepancies (like the color and decomposition temperature of A1). It's possible the \"A1\" description is slightly idealized or refers to a specific, highly reactive preparation. In chemical problems of this type, sometimes one must find the best fit among imperfect options. The reaction stoichiometry (`1:1`) seems like a very strong clue.\n\nLet's recalculate the molecular weight of A4, assuming A4 is SbF₃.\n*   M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n*   M(F) = 19.00 g/mol\n*   M(A4) = M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 121.76 + 57.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n\nNow let's check the given ranges:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 160-180\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls squarely in the range **C) 160-180**.\n\nLet's think about a possible alternative. What if the solution for obtaining A5 is not aqueous or in HF, but a melt? `Sb (l) + SbF₃ (l) -> 2 SbF₂ (l)`. This is a known reaction, but requires high temperature. The problem says \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n\nCould A4 be H[SbF₄]? Its molecular weight would be 1 + 121.76 + 4*19 = 198.76. This is not a binary compound of Y and F.\nCould A4 be SbF₅? M=216.8. Then A5 is \"Sb₂F₅\" (M=435.5). The reaction doesn't work with 1:1 ratio. M(A4)=216.8 is not in any range except A, but only barely.\n\nThe most consistent hypothesis is Y=Sb and A4=SbF₃.\n\nFinal check of the whole narrative:\n*   Y = Sb. Five binary fluorides could be considered SbF₃, SbF₅, (SbF₂)n, and perhaps some polyantimony fluoride anions treated as salts for counting purposes, or SbF. It's plausible.\n*   A2 = SbF₃. ɷF=31.96% matches well.\n*   A1 = A highly reactive form of SbF₅, or \"SbF₄\". Described as bright-red and decomposing to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. Let's assume A1=SbF₅, despite the color mismatch. It can oxidize Xe.\n*   A3 = SbF₅ (from fluorination of Sb). Can oxidize Xe.\n*   A4 = SbF₃. Forms a colorless solution.\n*   A5 from `Sb + SbF₃ (1:1) -> (SbF₂)n`. This is chemically reasonable.\n*   A5 ((SbF₂)n) decomposes in water to form Sb₂O₃ and HF, which are two substances. (Reaction: `2SbF₂ + 3H₂O -> Sb₂O₃ + 4HF`).\n\nThis chain of reasoning is consistent. The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is ~178.8 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
