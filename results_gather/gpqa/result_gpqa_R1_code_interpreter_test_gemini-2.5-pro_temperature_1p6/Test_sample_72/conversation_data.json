    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity `v_rel` of two objects moving in the same direction with velocities `v1` and `v2` in a single reference frame is given by the Lorentz velocity transformation:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1` (velocity of the first astronaut) = `0.6c`\n*   `v2` (velocity of the second astronaut) = `0.5c`\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its components.

    "Here is a summary of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the relative speed between the two astronauts.

Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy (E) of a particle is given by:\n\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\n\nwhere m₀ is the rest mass and γ (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v² / c²)`.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass, m₁ = 2m\n*   Velocity, v₁ = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy, E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass, m₂ = 3m\n*   Velocity, v₂ = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy, E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².
