    "This problem can be solved using the time-energy uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The time-energy uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can simultaneously know the energy of a particle and the time for which it possesses that energy. The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n*   **Calculating Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth):** For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. The lifetime of the state (τ) is the time uncertainty (Δt). We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) since the options are in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **Calculate ΔE for each state:**\n    *   For the first state (E1):\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   For the second state (E2):\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₂ - E₁|) must be greater than the spread or uncertainty in their energies. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be at least the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n    *   Required Energy Difference ≥ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required Energy Difference ≥ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required Energy Difference ≥ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required Energy Difference ≥ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **Comparing with Options:** We need to find the option that represents a possible energy difference satisfying this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Clearly resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\n    The energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the minimum required energy difference calculated, ensuring the two levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n**2.
