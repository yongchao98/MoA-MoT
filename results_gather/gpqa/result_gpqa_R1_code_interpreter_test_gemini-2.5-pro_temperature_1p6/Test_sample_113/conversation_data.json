    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one, NaCN, and reagent A.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. A cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This addition breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  `CH₃CH₂C(=O)CH₃ + CN⁻ ⇌ CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃` (alkoxide intermediate)\n        2.  `CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃CH₂C(OH)(CN)CH₃` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate in the second step to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. An acidic medium, represented by H₃O⁺, provides these protons. NaHSO₃ is used to form bisulfite addition compounds and is not the correct reagent for this step.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactants:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reagent B, and H₂O.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst and is typically heated.\n        *   `R-CN + 2 H₂O --(H⁺ or OH⁻ catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃` (or NH₄⁺ in acid, NH₃ in base).\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective for hydrolyzing nitriles.\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a common and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = HCl.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    *   We have determined that A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n        *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n        *   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n        *   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n    *   Option C correctly identifies both reagents.\n\n<<<C>>>"
