    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to find the pH of a solution at two specific points during a titration:\n    *   Point 1: At 25% titration.\n    *   Point 2: At the equivalence point.\n\n2.  **Initial State Calculation (Dilution):** First, I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after it's been diluted with water, but before any titrant (NaOH) is added.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH): `moles = concentration × volume`.\n        *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L * (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol.\n    *   Total volume after dilution:\n        *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L.\n    *   Concentration of the diluted acetic acid: `concentration = moles / volume`.\n        *   Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.\n\n3.  **Titration Reaction:** The reaction is between a weak acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH).\n    *   CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H₂O\n    *   This means 1 mole of acid reacts with 1 mole of base.\n\n4.  **Calculate Volume to Equivalence Point:** I need to know how much NaOH is required to completely neutralize the acid. This is the equivalence point volume (V_eq).\n    *   At equivalence, `moles of acid = moles of base`.\n    *   0.00100 mol of CH3COOH = `Concentration of NaOH × Volume of NaOH`\n    *   0.00100 mol = 0.1 M * V_eq\n    *   V_eq = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 mL.\n\n5.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   \"25% titration\" means 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 * V_eq = 0.25 * 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL.\n    *   At this stage, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This mixture is a buffer.\n    *   I can use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`, where [A⁻] is the conjugate base concentration and [HA] is the weak acid concentration.\n    *   First, calculate pKa: `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)`.\n    *   The ratio `[A⁻]/[HA]` can be simplified to the mole ratio, which is `0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3`.\n    *   So, `pH = pKa + log(1/3)`.\n    *   I will use Python to get a precise value for this calculation.\n\n6.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At this point, all the initial 0.00100 mol of CH3COOH has reacted with 0.00100 mol of NaOH to form 0.00100 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the initial diluted volume plus the volume of NaOH added: `V_total = 40.00 mL + V_eq = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L`.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is: `[CH3COO⁻] = moles / volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M`.\n    *   Since acetate is a weak base, it will react with water (hydrolysis), producing OH⁻ ions:\n        *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   To find the pH, I must first find the [OH⁻]. I'll need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   `Kb = Kw / Ka`, where Kw (the ion product of water) is 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n        *   `Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)`.\n    *   Now, I set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: `Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]`.\n    *   Let `x = [OH⁻]`. Then at equilibrium, `[CH₃COOH] = x` and `[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.020 - x`.\n    *   `Kb = x² / (0.020 - x)`. Since Kb is very small, I can approximate `0.020 - x ≈ 0.020`.\n    *   So, `Kb ≈ x² / 0.020`, which gives `x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * 0.020)`.\n    *   Once I have [OH⁻], I can find pOH: `pOH = -log([OH⁻])`.\n    *   Finally, I find pH: `pH = 14.00 - pOH`.\n    *   I'll use Python to compute these values accurately.\n\nNow, I will combine all the calculations into a single Python script to get the precise numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- GIVEN VALUES ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.0200 # L\ndilution_vol = 0.0200 # L\nconc_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- STEP 1: DILUTION & INITIAL MOLES ---\ninitial_moles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\ndiluted_volume_acid = initial_vol_acid + dilution_vol\n\n# --- STEP 2: CALCULATE pH AT 25% TITRATION ---\n# The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# [A-]/[HA] ratio at 25% titration is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- STEP 3: CALCULATE pH AT EQUIVALENCE POINT ---\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point\nV_eq = initial_moles_acid / conc_base\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_at_eq = diluted_volume_acid + V_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at the equivalence point\nconc_acetate_at_eq = initial_moles_acid / V_total_at_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-] concentration from hydrolysis of acetate\n# Using the approximation [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\n# This is a safe approximation as [Acetate]/Kb is very large.\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate_at_eq)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_at_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_eq = 14.00 - pOH_at_eq\n\n# --- FINAL OUTPUT ---\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places, matching the options.\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_eq:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\nThe calculated values are 4.26 for the pH at 25% titration and 8.52 for the pH at the equivalence point.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution and Stoichiometry**\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of acetic acid:** First, we need to find the number of moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in the initial 20.00 cm³ solution.\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate concentration after dilution:** The acid solution is diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Initial volume of acid solution = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n    *   The moles of CH₃COOH remain the same (0.00100 mol).\n    *   New concentration of CH₃COOH = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n3.  **Determine the equivalence point:** The titration reaction is CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. It's a 1:1 molar ratio. We need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize all the acetic acid.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH (V_eq) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 mL\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Buffer region:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% remains as acetic acid (CH₃COOH). This creates a buffer solution.\n2.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:** We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the weak acid (acetic acid).\n    *   The ratio of concentrations `[A⁻]/[HA]` is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is `0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3`.\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n4.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256 ≈ 4.26\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Hydrolysis of conjugate base:** At the equivalence point, all the CH₃COOH has reacted to form 0.00100 mol of its conjugate base, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution contains only this weak base.\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the conjugate base:**\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n3.  **Calculate Kb:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C)\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n4.  **Calculate [OH⁻]:** We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let `x` be the change in concentration, so at equilibrium `[OH⁻] = x` and `[CH₃COOH] = x`.\n    *   Kb = x² / ([CH₃COO⁻] - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate `[CH₃COO⁻] - x ≈ [CH₃COO⁻]`.\n    *   x² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n5.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Given Values ---\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.0200 # L (20.00 cm3)\ndilution_vol_water = 0.0200 # L (20.00 cm3)\nconc_NaOH = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles and concentration after dilution ---\nmoles_acid = initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid\nvol_after_dilution = initial_vol_acid + dilution_vol_water\nconc_after_dilution = moles_acid / vol_after_dilution\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---\n# This is a buffer region.
