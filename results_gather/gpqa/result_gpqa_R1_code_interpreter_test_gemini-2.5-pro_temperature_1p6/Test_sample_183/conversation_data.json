    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern). Let's analyze their relative positions and directing effects:\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: A strong activating group, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu)**: A weak activating group, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2)**: A strong deactivating group, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho**.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho**.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta**.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence of reactions that installs these three groups with the correct regiochemistry, in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Reduction gives aniline.\n    iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3) on aniline. This step fails. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline coordinates with the Lewis acid (AlCl3), forming a deactivating anilinium-like complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which shuts down the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    i) Alkylation gives tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration gives a mixture of o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    iii) Sulfonation of this product.\n    iv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl). This step is incorrect as there is no primary aromatic amine to diazotize at this stage. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**:\n    i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration -> predominantly **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group favoring para substitution.\n    iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) of p-tert-butylaniline. Under strong acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Let's analyze the directing effects on nitration:\n        - The t-butyl group at C1 is an o,p-director, directing to C2 and C6.\n        - The anilinium group (-NH3+) at C4 is a m-director, directing to C2 and C6.\n        - Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 (and C6) position. This gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium salt.\n    vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, Heat) -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\n    vii) Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    Let's check the product structure: OEt is at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C4. This is a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, where OEt and tBu are para. The target has a 1,2,3-pattern where OEt and tBu are ortho. Therefore, option C leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Option B**: This option utilizes a \"blocking group\" strategy, which is a common technique for controlling regiochemistry in complex syntheses.\n    i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4). The bulky t-butyl group directs the sulfonic acid group to the para position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The -SO3H group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n    iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). We are nitrating 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        - The t-butyl group (at C4) is an o,p-director. The para position (C1) is blocked by the sulfonic acid group. So, it directs to its ortho positions (C3, C5).\n        - The sulfonic acid group (at C1) is a m-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n        - Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 (or C5, which is equivalent) position.\n        - The product is **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Critically, in this intermediate, the **t-butyl and nitro groups are ortho to each other**, which is the arrangement required in the final product.\n    This initial strategy is the only one among the options that correctly establishes the ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. The subsequent steps in option B appear convoluted or contain typos (e.g., step vi, nitrating a diazonium salt is not standard). However, the successful establishment of the key ortho(tBu, NO2) relationship via an elegant and correct blocking group strategy makes this the most plausible synthetic route, despite the apparent errors in the later steps. The other options fail on more fundamental grounds (failed reactions or incorrect regiochemistry from the start). Therefore, B is the most likely correct answer, assuming there are errors in the description of the latter part of the synthesis.\n\nFinal check of the crucial step in B:\n- Starting material: 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Let's place SO3H at C1 and t-Bu at C4.\n- Nitration occurs at a position meta to SO3H (C3 or C5) and ortho to t-Bu (C3 or C5).\n- The product is 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. In this molecule, t-Bu and NO2 are ortho. This is the correct relative orientation for the final product. No other option achieves this.\n\n<<<B>>>"
