    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n    According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the molecule is a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant (position) 1.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** At position C1.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH3):** \"para to the carboxylic acid\". The para position to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as 'formyl' substituent) and Cyano group (-CN):** \"all meta to one another\" (referring to COOH, CHO, and CN). The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. Thus, the formyl and cyano groups are at C3 and C5 (we don't know which is where yet). This also satisfies the condition that formyl and cyano are meta to each other.\n    *   **Hydroxyl group (-OH, named as 'hydroxy') and Dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2):** \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid\". The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6 (again, we don't know which is where yet).\n\n    So far, the basic substitution pattern is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n    *   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n    *   C4: -OCH3\n\n3.  **Determine the Numbering Direction (Tie-Breaker Rule):**\n    The IUPAC rule for numbering states that we should assign the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents. In this case, no matter whether we number clockwise or counter-clockwise from C1, the set of locants for the substituents will always be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    When the locant set is identical, we use a tie-breaker rule: The numbering is chosen that assigns the lowest locant to the substituent group that is cited first in the name (i.e., comes first in alphabetical order).\n\n    Let's list the substituent names alphabetically:\n    1.  **cyano**\n    2.  **dimethylamino**\n    3.  **formyl**\n    4.  **hydroxy**\n    5.  **methoxy**\n\n    The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". To follow the rule, we must choose the numbering direction that gives the cyano group the lowest possible locant. The cyano group is at either C3 or C5. The lowest possible locant is 3. Therefore, the cyano group must be at C3, which fixes the numbering direction.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final, Unambiguous Structure:**\n    Based on the numbering direction fixed in the previous step:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n    *   Since the formyl group is also meta to C1, it must be at the other meta position, **C5**.\n    *   We have a final clue: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C3. The methoxy (-OCH3) is at C4, which is ortho to C3. This is consistent.\n    *   The alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) must also be ortho to C3. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.\n    *   This leaves the last ortho position, **C6**, for the dimethylamino group.\n\n    The final, complete structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n5.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Now, list the substituents with their determined locants, arranged alphabetically, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)  *(parentheses are used for complex substituents)*\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\n    Combining these gives the name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    This name matches option B exactly.\n\n    *   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetization.\n    *   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct**.\n    *   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering (violates the tie-breaker rule).\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrectly ordered (substituents are listed by number, not alphabetically).\n\n<<<B>>>"
