    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which is specified to have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH₄) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group (C=O) at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule is chiral (due to C5), the hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl carbon can occur from two different faces, leading to two different stereochemical outcomes at C3.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S). Diastereomers are generally formed in unequal amounts.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both groups react.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The product has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The molecule has identical substituents on its two stereocenters (C2 and C4). This means that the (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are the same molecule, and it is a meso compound (an achiral molecule with stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** This reaction produces three stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (part of a racemic pair)\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (part of a racemic pair)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (which is (2R, 4S))\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol       (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Enantiomers**, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will co-elute and appear as a single peak. The pair (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. (2 peaks)\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair. It will be separated from the pair. (1 peak for the meso, 1 peak for the pair)\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different and will have different retention times.\n*   Counting the peaks:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  A single peak for the racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Therefore, a total of **4 peaks** will be observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   Let's count the separable compounds from our mixture of five:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral, enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   Since all five compounds are unique stereoisomers, an effective chiral column will resolve all of them.\n*   Therefore, a total of **5 peaks** will be observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
