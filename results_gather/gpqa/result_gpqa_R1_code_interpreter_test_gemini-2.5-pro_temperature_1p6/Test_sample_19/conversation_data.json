    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation (IA)**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, \"quasi-free\" nucleon inside that nucleus. The interaction happens so quickly (it's an \"impulse\") that the other nucleons are mere spectators and the binding forces holding the struck nucleon in the nucleus don't have time to act during the collision. The final state is then analyzed as if a free nucleon, with some initial momentum (Fermi motion), was struck.\n\nLet's evaluate the given assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the very foundation of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) couples to a single nucleon. It explicitly excludes more complex processes where the probe interacts with a pair of nucleons or with meson-exchange currents between nucleons. Without this assumption, you cannot treat the interaction as a simple one-on-one collision. This statement is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This deals with what happens *after* the primary interaction. If the struck nucleon, or the probe itself after scattering, re-interacts with other nucleons on its way out of the nucleus (a process called Final State Interactions, or FSI), the simple picture is destroyed. The energy and momentum of the outgoing particles would be altered, and you could no longer relate them directly to the initial impulsive event. Assuming transparency (i.e., neglecting FSI) is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA). This statement is essential for the approximation to hold in its basic form.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing it with a specific model (like the non-relativistic quark model). The impulse approximation, however, is a statement about the *dynamics of the nucleon within the nuclear medium* during a scattering event. The IA can be applied in contexts where the nucleon's internal structure is probed at very high energies, and the quarks are highly relativistic (as in Deep Inelastic Scattering). Therefore, assuming quarks are non-relativistic is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation. It's an assumption about the nucleon model, not the interaction dynamics with the nucleus. This statement is not essential.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. For the approximation to be valid, the energy transferred in the collision must be much larger than the nucleon's binding energy (typically ~8 MeV) and the potential energy due to its neighbors. The interaction time is then very short, so short that the forces binding the nucleon to the nucleus can be considered negligible *during* the collision. The nucleon is effectively \"free\" at the moment it is struck. This statement is essential.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe three essential assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n*   The probe interacts with a single nucleon (1).\n*   The nucleus is transparent to the outgoing particles (2).\n*   The binding forces are negligible during the fast interaction (4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
