    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether they are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is often due to the presence of a stereocenter (like a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality like an axis or a plane of chirality.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls have two phenyl rings connected by a C-C single bond.\n    *   Rotation around this central single bond can be restricted if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted: two with nitro groups (-NO2) and two with dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. This hindered rotation is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   Because the molecule is forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is chiral. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and shows optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. An achiral molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry.\n    *   It also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism. (It does show geometric isomerism, but that is different).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTo verify this, we can use computational chemistry tools.\n\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n\ndef check_optical_isomerism(name, smiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a molecule can exhibit optical isomerism by detecting chirality.\n    \"\"\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    if mol is None:\n        print(f\"Could not parse SMILES for {name}\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Add hydrogens as they are crucial for stereochemistry\n    mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    \n    # Generate a 3D conformation, which is necessary to detect atropisomerism\n    # Use a reproducible random seed\n    params = AllChem.ETKDGv3()\n    params.randomSeed = 42\n    if AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol_h, params) == -1:\n        # Try a different random seed if the first fails\n        params.randomSeed = 1\n        if AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol_h, params) == -1:\n             # If embedding fails, we can't determine atropisomerism reliably.\n             # However, for this specific problem, we check for tetrahedral centers as a fallback.\n             chiral_centers_2d = Chem.FindMolChiralCenters(mol, includeUnassigned=True)\n             is_chiral = len(chiral_centers_2d) > 0\n             print(f\"{name}: {is_chiral} (3D embedding failed, fallback to 2D)\")\n             return\n\n    # RDKit's FindMolChiralCenters can find tetrahedral and axial chirality (atropisomers)\n    # The modern implementation is more robust.\n    chiral_centers = Chem.FindMolChiralCenters(mol_h, includeUnassigned=True, useLegacyImplementation=False)\n    \n    is_chiral = len(chiral_centers) > 0\n    print(f\"{name}: {is_chiral}\")\n\n\n# Names and corresponding SMILES strings\ncompounds = {\n    \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": \"COC(=O)c1c(N(=O)=O)cccc1-c1cccc(N(=O)=O)c1C(=O)OC\",\n    \"2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\": \"CC(O)C(=O)OC\",\n    \"3. benzophenone\": \"O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2\",\n    \"4. dimethyl fumarate\": \"COC(=O)/C=C/C(=O)OC\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Checking for optical isomerism (chirality):\")\nfor name, smiles in compounds.items():\n    check_optical_isomerism(name, smiles)\n\n```\n<<<\nA\n>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Common sources of chirality include:\n1.  **Chiral centers (stereocenters):** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial, planar, or helical chirality:** Chirality that arises from the overall shape of the molecule, such as in allenes, spiranes, or atropisomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl molecule, which consists of two benzene rings linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   On the first ring, there is a dimethyl carboxylate group (`-COOCH₃`) at position 2 and a nitro group (`-NO₂`) at position 6.\n    *   On the second ring, there is a dimethyl carboxylate group at position 2' and a nitro group at position 6'.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions 2, 6, 2', and 6' are the \"ortho\" positions, meaning they are immediately adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings. In this molecule, all four ortho positions are occupied by bulky substituents (`-COOCH₃` and `-NO₂`). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing free rotation around the central C-C single bond. This locking of the rings into a twisted, non-planar conformation is known as **atropisomerism**. Because the molecule is forced into this conformation and it does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, `-OH`). This carbon is attached to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (`-H`)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (`-OH`)\n    3.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH₃`)\n*   Since the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the central `C=O` group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral**, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration about the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbons in the double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, there is a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center) -> Shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (plane of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (plane and center of symmetry) -> Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option A.\n\n***\nNote on the code output: The provided Python script incorrectly reported compound 1 as achiral. This is likely due to an error in the SMILES string used in the script, which did not correctly represent the structure with bulky groups at all four ortho positions. The chemical principle of atropisomerism in such heavily substituted biphenyls is a well-established and standard example of chirality without a traditional chiral center. The conclusion based on established chemical principles is more reliable in this case.\n***\n\n<<<A>>>"
