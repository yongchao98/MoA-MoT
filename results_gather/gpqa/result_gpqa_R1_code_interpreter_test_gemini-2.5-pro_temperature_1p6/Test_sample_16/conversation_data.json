    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Reaction Setup**: The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. Since we are interested in the concentration of the free ions, we should consider the dissociation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex, which corresponds to the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x         |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                |\n\n    According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $EDTA^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n4.  **Solving for x**: We substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Calculation**: Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n    To perform the calculation, a simple python script can be used.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Solving for x from x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation shows that $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is x.\n$[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry**: We start with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is in equilibrium, meaning it can dissociate into its component ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($EDTA^{4-}$). The question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions at equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Write the Chemical Equation**: The equilibrium of interest is the dissociation of the complex:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant**: The problem provides the *formation* constant ($K_f$), which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n4.  **Set Up an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x         |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                |\n\n    The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. The initial concentrations of the free ions are 0. When 'x' moles/L of the complex dissociate, 'x' moles/L of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' moles/L of $EDTA^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n5.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression**: Now we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant equation:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and Solve**: The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and only a tiny amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Final Answer**: The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\nThe Python code used to calculate the value of 'x' confirmed this result.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# From the simplified equilibrium expression: K_f = initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# Rearranging to solve for x: x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / K_f)\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The result 'x' is the concentration of Ca2+ ions.\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ is approximately {x:.1e} M\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe concentration of Ca2+ is approximately 6.3e-07 M\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives a result of $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nComparing this with the given choices:\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M.
