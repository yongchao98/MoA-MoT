    "This problem requires understanding the stereochemical outcome of the epoxidation and subsequent acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of (E) and (Z) isomers of an alkene, and then applying the principles of achiral and chiral chromatography to the resulting product mixture.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom is added to one face of the double bond.\n        *   (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n        *   Epoxidation of the trans-alkene will produce a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction where water acts as the nucleophile. The mechanism is SN2-like, involving an anti-attack of the nucleophile on one of the protonated epoxide carbons. The overall result of the two steps (syn-epoxidation + anti-ring opening) is an anti-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   **Applying the rule:** The anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene yields meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol). This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    *   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n        *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n        *   Epoxidation of the cis-alkene yields a meso epoxide: meso-4,5-epoxyoctane ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** This is again an anti-attack by water.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   **Applying the rule:** The anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two chiral compounds that are enantiomers of each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the combined product mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n        *   Product 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        *   Product 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        *   Product 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   **Stereochemical relationships:**\n        *   Products 2 and 3 are enantiomers.\n        *   Product 1 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of Product 2 and Product 3.\n\n4.  **Predict the HPLC chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n        *   Enantiomers (like Products 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   Diastereomers (like Product 1 vs. the pair of Products 2 & 3) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n        *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol (Product 1) and another for the unresolved racemic pair of diols (Products 2 and 3).\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   The chiral column can separate the enantiomers (Product 2 and Product 3) into two distinct peaks.\n        *   The chiral column can also separate diastereomers. The meso compound (Product 1) is a diastereomer of the other two and will also be separated from them.\n        *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the combined product mixture will show **2 peaks in standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
