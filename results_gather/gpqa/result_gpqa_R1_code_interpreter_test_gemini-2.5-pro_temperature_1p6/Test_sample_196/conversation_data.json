    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of Compound X.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate the C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet ('bs') at such a high chemical shift (>10 ppm) is definitive proof of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) shows two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons. This pattern is characteristic of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating it is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the -COOH group we've already identified. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Now we need to determine the structure of the other substituent from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us a `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment (an ethyl group).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This gives us a `-CH-CH₃` fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is adjacent to both the methyl group (3H) and the methine group (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton) and is adjacent to the methyl group (3H) and the methylene group (2H).\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting the fragments together, the benzylic carbon (-CH-) is attached to both a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The overall structure is `Ring-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option B, but option B is a potential answer for the final product, not the starting material. We must complete the second part of the question.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Other functional groups like ketones and alcohols are also reduced to the corresponding alkanes, but here the relevant transformation is for the carboxylic acid. The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl (sec-butyl) group will not be affected under these conditions.\n    *   **Prediction:** The `-COOH` group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a `-CH₃` group.\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Reaction:** `-COOH` → `-CH₃`\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. This matches our predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
