    "Here is my reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration that is heavily hydrogen-bonded. While alcohols have broad O-H peaks (typically 3200-3600 cm⁻¹), the shift to such a low wavenumber (3000 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where the O-H bonds form strong dimers.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Atomic mass of C=12, O=16, H=1; so, 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   Our identified functional groups are a carboxylic acid (which contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DoU) and an alkene (which contains one C=C double bond, contributing another 1 to the DoU).\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options. I will use a simple Python script for this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a C,H,O formula.\"\"\"\n    return C + 1 - (H / 2)\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformula_A = \"C6H12O2\"\nformula_C = \"C6H10O2\"\n\n# Calculate DoU for each\ndou_A = calculate_dou(6, 12)\ndou_C = calculate_dou(6, 10)\n\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_A}: {int(dou_A)}\")\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_C}: {int(dou_C)}\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation and the spectral data:\n*   **C6H12O2 (DoU = 1):** A DoU of 1 can only account for the one C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid. It would represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C double bond.\n*   **C6H10O2 (DoU = 2):** A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid and the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectroscopic evidence points towards a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this peak to be very broad and shifted to a lower frequency compared to the O-H stretch of an alcohol (which is typically around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. A carboxylic acid C=O stretch typically appears at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to \"vinyl-hydrogens\" (protons on a C=C double bond) confirms the presence of an alkene, which is consistent with the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic and diagnostic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; so 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides very strong evidence for the -COOH functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Eliminate Options:**\n    *   The combined evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This fact immediately eliminates options B (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), as they each only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: A (C₆H₁₂O₂) and C (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n        *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unaturation for the correct formula must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid and would mean the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that is consistent with all the provided spectral data, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid with 6 carbons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
