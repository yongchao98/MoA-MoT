    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and its total energy.**\n    The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics and annihilation, this implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n\n    The total energy of the initial system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so its rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.3 MeV.\n\n    Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$):\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Identify the final state and apply conservation of energy.**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are antiparticles of each other, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n    According to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy ($E_{final}$).\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    The initial momentum is zero (since the particles are at rest). By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final four particles must also be zero. For the problem to have a single answer for the velocity, we assume the energy is distributed symmetrically among the four final particles.\n\n    Energy of each particle A ($E_A$):\n    $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the velocity of particle A using the relativistic energy formula.**\n    The total energy ($E$) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation:\n    $E = \\gamma m c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n    We know the total energy of one A particle ($E_A = 469.15$ MeV) and its rest mass energy ($m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV). We can first find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n    Now, we can solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a small Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# 1. Initial total energy\n# E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2, because the system is a proton and an antiproton at rest.\ne_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# 2. Final state has 4 particles (2 A+ and 2 A-).\n# By conservation of energy, the energy is distributed among them.\n# Assuming symmetrical distribution, energy per particle A is:\ne_A = e_initial / 4\n\n# 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A\n# E_A = gamma * m_A_c2\ngamma = e_A / m_A_c2\n\n# 4. Calculate beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) => beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n\nprint(f\"{beta=:.4f}\")\n```\nbeta=0.7688\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.7688c, which rounds to 0.77c. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The python code confirms the reasoning.\n\n**Calculation Summary:**\n1.  The total initial energy of the proton-antiproton pair at rest is $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n2.  By conservation of energy, this energy is converted into the total energy of the four A particles in the final state. Assuming the energy is distributed symmetrically, the energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n3.  The total energy of a relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15}{300} \\approx 1.5638$.\n4.  The velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Letting $\\beta = v/c$, we solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n\nThe code output `beta=0.7688` matches this calculation. The velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
