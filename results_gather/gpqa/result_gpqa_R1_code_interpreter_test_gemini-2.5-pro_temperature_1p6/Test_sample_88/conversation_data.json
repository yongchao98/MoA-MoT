    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).\n*   **Reagents:** KOH (a strong base), 240°C (high heat).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone, as aldehydes are more easily oxidized. The frequency is slightly high for a simple cyclohexanone, suggesting a strained ring system.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: The total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material, implying no hydrogens were lost or gained. The molecular formula of Product 1 is likely C10H14O.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Standard elimination (E2) and substitution (S_N1, S_N2) reactions are disfavored at the bridgehead positions of adamantane due to extreme strain (Bredt's rule) and steric hindrance. At high temperatures with alkali, 1,3-dihaloadamantanes are known to undergo a complex rearrangement. A common and well-documented transformation under these or similar conditions is the conversion to a protoadamantane skeleton. The reaction likely proceeds through hydrolysis and/or rearrangement, possibly with subsequent air oxidation at the high temperature, to form a ketone. The most plausible structure for Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one** (systematic name: tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]decan-4-one). While the provided NMR data (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is unusual for this structure and may be erroneous or belong to a very obscure isomer, protoadamantan-4-one is the most logical product given the reagents and is consistent with the IR data and molecular formula.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (a ketone, likely protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, heat.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. So, protoadamantan-4-one would be reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene. It is common for the conditions of MPV reduction (heating with a Lewis acid, Al(OiPr)₃) to also cause the dehydration of the initially formed alcohol product.\n    *   Ketone → (Reduction) → Alcohol → (Dehydration) → Alkene\n*   The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol would eliminate a water molecule. Elimination of the hydroxyl group from C4 and a proton from the adjacent C5 would form a double bond between C4 and C5. This product, **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]dec-4-ene), is a stable alkene (the double bond is not at a bridgehead, so it does not violate Bredt's rule). Therefore, Product 2 is protoadamant-4-ene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C; 2. Dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. A reductive workup converts the cleaved carbons into aldehydes or ketones. Since both carbons of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene (C4 and C5) are bonded to one hydrogen atom each, the cleavage will result in two aldehyde groups. The reaction cleaves the C4=C5 bond, which opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic dialdehyde.\n*   The carbon skeleton of protoadamantane (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]decane) is essentially a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework with an extra bond. Cleaving the C4=C5 bond breaks the four-carbon bridge of the protoadamantane structure, leaving a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** ring system with aldehyde groups at positions 3 and 7.\n*   Therefore, Product 3 is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Structure:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. This molecule has C₂ᵥ symmetry in its preferred chair-chair conformation.\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with a deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:**\n    1.  The aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded (δ ≈ 9-10 ppm), but the question specifies to exclude exchangeable protons (aldehyde protons are sometimes considered non-exchangeable under anhydrous conditions, but they are the trivial answer, so we look at the C-H protons).\n    2.  The next most deshielded protons will be those alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. These are the methine protons on C3 and C7 (H3 and H7). Due to the molecule's symmetry, H3 and H7 are chemically equivalent and will have the same signal.\n*   **Coupling of H3 (and H7):**\n    *   We need to identify the neighboring protons that will couple to H3. H3 is bonded to a carbon which is adjacent to C2 and C4.\n    *   H3 is therefore coupled to the two protons on C2 and the two protons on C4.\n    *   In the stable chair-chair conformation, H3 is axial (pointing inwards). Its four neighboring protons are H2ₐₓ, H2ₑq, H4ₐₓ, and H4ₑq.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling environment at C2 is identical to that at C4. So, H3 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons (H2ₐₓ and H4ₐₓ) with a coupling constant Jₐₐ, and to two equivalent equatorial protons (H2ₑq and H4ₑq) with a coupling constant Jₐₑ.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   The two equivalent axial protons will split the signal for H3 into a triplet (n=2, so 2nI+1 = 2*2*0.5+1 = 3).\n    *   The two equivalent equatorial protons will further split each line of that triplet into another triplet (n=2, so 2*2*0.5+1 = 3).\n    *   The coupling constants for axial-axial (Jₐₐ, typically 10-13 Hz) and axial-equatorial (Jₐₑ, typically 2-5 Hz) interactions are significantly different. Therefore, the pattern will not collapse into a simple pentet.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
