    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the notation:**\n    The notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It's defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log10( (nX / nY)_star ) - log10( (nX / nY)_sun )`\n    where `nX` and `nY` are the number densities of the elements.\n\n    The abundance of an element X relative to Hydrogen (H) is often expressed as:\n    `A(X) = 12 + log10(nX / nH)`\n    From this, we can derive a useful relation for `[X/Y]`:\n    `[X/Y] = (A(X)_star - A(Y)_star) - (A(X)_sun - A(Y)_sun)`\n    A special case is when Y is Hydrogen (H). Since `A(H)` is defined as 12 for all stars and the Sun:\n    `[X/H] = (A(X)_star - A(H)_star) - (A(X)_sun - A(H)_sun) = (A(X)_star - 12) - (A(X)_sun - 12) = A(X)_star - A(X)_sun`\n\n2.  **Analyze the abundances for Star 1:**\n    We are given `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` and `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`.\n    *   From `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`, we have:\n        `A(Fe)_1 - A(Fe)_sun = 0  => A(Fe)_1 = A(Fe)_sun`\n    *   From `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`, we have:\n        `(A(Si)_1 - A(Fe)_1) - (A(Si)_sun - A(Fe)_sun) = 0.3`\n    *   Since `A(Fe)_1 = A(Fe)_sun`, we can substitute this into the equation:\n        `(A(Si)_1 - A(Fe)_sun) - (A(Si)_sun - A(Fe)_sun) = 0.3`\n        `A(Si)_1 - A(Fe)_sun - A(Si)_sun + A(Fe)_sun = 0.3`\n        `A(Si)_1 - A(Si)_sun = 0.3`\n\n3.  **Analyze the abundances for Star 2:**\n    We are given `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` and `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`.\n    *   From `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`, we have:\n        `A(Mg)_2 - A(Mg)_sun = 0  => A(Mg)_2 = A(Mg)_sun`\n    *   From `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`, we have:\n        `(A(Mg)_2 - A(Si)_2) - (A(Mg)_sun - A(Si)_sun) = 0.3`\n    *   Since `A(Mg)_2 = A(Mg)_sun`, we can substitute this into the equation:\n        `(A(Mg)_sun - A(Si)_2) - (A(Mg)_sun - A(Si)_sun) = 0.3`\n        `A(Mg)_sun - A(Si)_2 - A(Mg)_sun + A(Si)_sun = 0.3`\n        `-A(Si)_2 + A(Si)_sun = 0.3`\n        `A(Si)_2 = A(Si)_sun - 0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms:**\n    The question asks for the \"ratio of silicon atoms\". In stellar abundance studies, this typically refers to the ratio of the fractional number abundances relative to hydrogen, i.e., `(nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2)`.\n    Let's call this ratio `R`.\n\n    From the definition `A(Si) = 12 + log10(nSi / nH)`, we have:\n    `log10(nSi / nH) = A(Si) - 12`\n\n    So, for our two stars:\n    `log10(nSi_1 / nH_1) = A(Si)_1 - 12`\n    `log10(nSi_2 / nH_2) = A(Si)_2 - 12`\n\n    To find the ratio `R = (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2)`, we can work with the logarithms:\n    `log10(R) = log10( (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) )`\n    `log10(R) = log10(nSi_1 / nH_1) - log10(nSi_2 / nH_2)`\n    `log10(R) = (A(Si)_1 - 12) - (A(Si)_2 - 12)`\n    `log10(R) = A(Si)_1 - A(Si)_2`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `A(Si)_1` and `A(Si)_2` that we found in steps 2 and 3:\n    `A(Si)_1 = A(Si)_sun + 0.3`\n    `A(Si)_2 = A(Si)_sun - 0.3`\n\n    `log10(R) = (A(Si)_sun + 0.3) - (A(Si)_sun - 0.3)`\n    `log10(R) = 0.6`\n\n    To find the ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm:\n    `R = 10^0.6`\n\n5.  **Compute the numerical value:**\n    We will now use a simple python script to calculate the value of `10^0.6`. The extraneous information such as star masses and specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg is not needed for the calculation, as the required solar abundance of Silicon (`A(Si)_sun`) cancels out.\n\n```python\nimport math\n# The ratio of silicon atoms (relative to hydrogen) is 10 raised to the power of the difference in their logarithmic abundances.\n# From the derivation, the difference is 0.6 dex.\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```\n>>>\n3.9810717055349722\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 3.98, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
