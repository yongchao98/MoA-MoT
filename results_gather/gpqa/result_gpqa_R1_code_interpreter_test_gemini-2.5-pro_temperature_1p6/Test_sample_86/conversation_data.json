    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the given compound.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Compound's Structure from the Given Information**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This identifies the core as a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (C₆H₄).\n2.  **Total Carbon Atoms:** The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This means a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen is one of the two substituents.\n4.  **Putting it all together:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). It has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the carbonyl group and the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The only common, stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the General 1H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone**\n\nLet's predict the signals we should expect to see in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Total Number of Protons:** The benzene ring part (C₆H₄) has 4 protons. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has 3 protons. The total number of protons is 4 + 3 = 7.\n2.  **Expected Signals:**\n    *   **Acetyl Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not to any carbon with protons. It should appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3 protons (3H)**. Its typical chemical shift (δ) is in the range of **2.1 - 2.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** There are **4 protons** on the ring. They will appear in the aromatic region, typically between **6.5 - 8.5 ppm**. The splitting pattern of these 4 protons will depend on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Possible Isomers and Their Expected Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring:\n\n*   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** This would result in 4 unique aromatic protons, leading to a complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets, each for 1H).\n*   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** This would also result in 4 unique aromatic protons, also leading to a complex multiplet pattern.\n*   **Para (1,4-substitution):** This arrangement is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons due to the plane of symmetry.\n    *   The 2 protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The 2 protons ortho to the halogen are chemically equivalent.\n    *   This typically results in a simple and characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2 protons (2H)**. This pattern is often referred to as an AA'BB' system.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given NMR Options**\n\nNow, let's compare our predictions with the options provided.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The signal at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for an acetyl methyl and has the wrong integration (2H instead of 3H). This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). An aldehyde-containing structure consistent with the carbon count (e.g., halophenylacetaldehyde) would have a -CH₂- group next to the -CHO, which should be a doublet, not the singlet observed at 3.7 ppm. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Check the Acetyl Signal:** There is a **singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H**. This is a perfect match for the -COCH₃ group.\n    *   **Check the Aromatic Signals:** There are **two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H**. This pattern is the classic signature of a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring.\n    *   **Check Total Protons:** 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This matches our calculation.\n    *   This option perfectly describes the spectrum of a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), which is impossible for an aromatic compound. The chemical shift at 1.3 ppm is too upfield for an acetyl methyl group. This does not match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option C provides 1H NMR data that is fully consistent with the structure deduced from the problem statement. The compound is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n```python\n# Final confirmation of the logic.\n\n# Information about the compound:\n# 1. Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\n# 2.

    "To determine the correct ¹H NMR data, let's break down the information given about the unknown compound and deduce its structure.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Structure Analysis**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: The core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR data: \"presence of a carbonyl group\"**: This means one of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR data: \"presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., -F, -Cl, -Br, -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n\nBased on this, the two substituents are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the molecule is a **haloacetophenone** (structure: X-C₆H₄-COCH₃).\n\n**2. Predicting the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's predict the ¹H NMR signals for a haloacetophenone.\n*   **Total Protons**: The benzene ring (C₆H₄) has 4 protons, and the acetyl methyl group (-CH₃) has 3 protons, for a total of **7 protons**.\n*   **Signal 1 (Acetyl group)**: The methyl protons (-CH₃) are adjacent to a carbonyl group and have no neighboring protons. This will produce a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift (δ) for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.5 ppm**.\n*   **Signal 2 (Aromatic protons)**: There are **4H** on the benzene ring. They will appear in the aromatic region, typically between **6.5-8.5 ppm**. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n    *   **para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution)**: This creates a highly symmetrical molecule. We would expect to see a simple pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. This is a very common and characteristic pattern.\n    *   **ortho- or meta-substitution**: These isomers are less symmetrical and would typically produce more complex splitting patterns for the 4 aromatic protons (e.g., four distinct multiplets).\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's compare our prediction with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. This spectrum only shows 1H in the aromatic region. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not typical for aromatic protons. The signal at 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, not 3H, and is too far upfield for an acetyl methyl.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. The singlet at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Correct.** This spectrum matches our prediction perfectly.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the **acetyl methyl group** (-COCH₃), appearing as a singlet for 3 protons in the correct chemical shift range.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring, accounting for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   The total integration (2 + 2 + 3 = 7H) is correct.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. There are no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), which is impossible for an aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the data in option C corresponds to a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
