    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon. These are proportional to the Pauli matrices, which are fundamental in describing spin-1/2 particles like muons. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector `n`:**\n    The problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in 3D can be represented in spherical coordinates as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. Since the vector lies in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. This corresponds to setting the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. Here, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator `P_n` along the direction `n`:**\n    The operator corresponding to the spin measurement along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\n4.  **Write the matrix representation of `P_n`:**\n    Substitute the Pauli matrices into the expression for $P_n$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    This matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the relationship between `a` and `b` using the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)$\n\n    To simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the equation for `b`:\n    $b = a \\left( \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, the unnormalized eigenvector is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    Let's choose a convenient value for `a` to simplify the process. Since the overall phase of an eigenvector is arbitrary, we can choose `a` to be real and positive. Let the normalized eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = N \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ where N is a normalization constant.\n    $|N|^2 (1^2 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|N|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|N|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    We can choose $N = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (taking the positive real root).\n\n    Now, substitute this normalization constant back into the eigenvector expression:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\nTo double-check the result, let's verify it with a symbolic computation.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols\nhbar = sp.Symbol('hbar')\ntheta = sp.Symbol('theta')\n\n# Define the matrix operator P_n without the hbar/2 factor\nM = sp.Matrix([\n    [sp.cos(theta), sp.sin(theta)],\n    [sp.sin(theta), -sp.cos(theta)]\n])\n\n# The eigenvalue of P_n is +hbar/2, so the eigenvalue of M is +1.\n# We are looking for the eigenvector of M for the eigenvalue 1.\n# Let the eigenvector be v = [a, b].

    "The code interpreter has successfully executed the python script. I will now analyze the output and provide the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Python Code and Output\n\n1.  **Objective of the Code:** The python script was designed to verify the solution by:\n    *   Defining the matrix operator $M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$, which is the core part of the operator $P_n$ (with the constant $\\hbar/2$ and the eigenvalue $+1$ factored out).\n    *   Defining the proposed eigenvector from option A, $v = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   Checking if $v$ is indeed an eigenvector of $M$ with eigenvalue 1 by calculating $M \\cdot v$.\n    *   Checking if $v$ is normalized.\n    *   Using `sympy`'s built-in eigensolver as an independent check.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Output:**\n    *   `Proposed eigenvector: Matrix([[cos(theta/2)], [sin(theta/2)]])`\n    *   `M * v = Matrix([[cos(theta/2)], [sin(theta/2)]])`\n        This output clearly shows that `M * v = v`. This is the definition of an eigenvector `v` with an eigenvalue of `1`. Since we were solving for the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ for the operator $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}M$, this confirms that our vector is the correct eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    *   `Norm squared: 1`\n        This output confirms that the squared norm of the vector $v$, which is $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, simplifies to 1. This means the eigenvector is correctly normalized.\n    *   `Eigenvector from solver (normalized): ...`\n        The result from the built-in solver is algebraically complex but, as shown in the initial reasoning, it simplifies to the same result. The clean result was obtained by a more direct approach of guessing the form and normalizing, which is a standard technique. The python output confirms that my initial derivation was correct.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe initial reasoning, which led to the conclusion that the eigenvector is $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$, has been rigorously verified by the symbolic computation. The proposed vector is indeed a normalized eigenvector of the operator $P_n$ with the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. This corresponds exactly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
