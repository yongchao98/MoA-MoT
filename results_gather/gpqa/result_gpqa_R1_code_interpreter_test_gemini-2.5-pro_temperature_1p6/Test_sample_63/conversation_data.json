    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Data**\n\nThe experiment involves heating a mixture of two salts (A and B) and analyzing the gaseous products. Let's break down what each part of the experimental setup tells us.\n\n*   **Initial Mixture:** An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both A and B. The total mass is `n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g`, where M_A and M_B are the molar masses.\n*   **Heating:** The salts decompose completely into a mixture of gases at 200°C.\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The mass of the tube did not change, which means no CO₂ or other acidic gases were present in the product mixture. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂) or oxides of nitrogen (e.g., N₂O, NO). The reaction `2Cu + O -> CuO` describes the mass gain. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen atoms that bind to the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all the reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains. This measurement is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Gas C is what's left after passing through a water absorber, an acid-gas absorber, and a tube that removes oxidizing gases. This strongly suggests Gas C is a non-reactive gas, most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nSince the salts decompose completely into gases, the atoms in the product gases must be the same atoms that were in the original salts A and B. Let's tally the total moles of each element from the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All the hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H atoms = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The final gas is 0.1 mol of N₂. However, the reaction in Tube №3 might have also produced N₂. Let's consider the most likely candidate for the oxidizing gas that reacted with Cu. Given the other elements are N, H, and O, and the products are gases from heating salts, a likely gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The decomposition of ammonium nitrate at this temperature produces N₂O.\n    *   Let's assume the oxidizing gas was N₂O. This gas contains the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. Thus, we had 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n    *   The reaction in Tube №3 is: `N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂`.\n    *   This reaction would produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The total N₂ collected (Gas C) was 0.1 mol. This means that 0.1 mol = (N₂ from decomposition) + (N₂ from N₂O reaction).\n    *   So, N₂ from decomposition = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, the initial gaseous products from the decomposition were: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Now, let's find the total moles of Nitrogen atoms:\n        Total moles of N atoms = (0.05 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 2 N/N₂O) = 0.1 mol + 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol N.\n\nSo, the total elemental composition from the 7.20 g mixture is: **0.4 mol H, 0.25 mol O, and 0.2 mol N.**\nLet's check the total mass: `(0.4 * 1.0) + (0.25 * 16.0) + (0.2 * 14.0) = 0.4 + 4.0 + 2.8 = 7.2 g`. This matches the initial mass perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for two common salts (A and B) that together contain N, H, and O in the molar ratio N:H:O of 0.2:0.4:0.25, which simplifies to 4:8:5. The combined chemical formula for (A + B) is N₄H₈O₅.\nThe salts are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\nLet's test the common ones:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nIf we add the atoms of one formula unit of each:\n*   Total N = 2 + 2 = 4\n*   Total H = 4 + 4 = 8\n*   Total O = 2 + 3 = 5\nThe combined formula is N₄H₈O₅, which matches our derived composition.\n\nLet's check if the decomposition reactions of these salts match the observed products:\n*   Salt A = NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   Salt B = NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (This decomposition occurs around 200°C)\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, so if we have `n` moles of each:\n`n NH₄NO₂ + n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + n N₂O + 4n H₂O`\n\nFrom our data analysis in Step 1, we found the products were 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.2 mol H₂O.\nComparing this to the reaction equation:\n*   `n` = 0.05 mol (from N₂ and N₂O)\n*   `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (from H₂O)\nThe values are consistent. So, we had n=0.05 moles of each salt. The identification of Salt A as **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and Salt B as **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₂ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
