    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary charged pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. We will apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n**Given data:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), `M_pi` = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), `M_mu` = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The Pi(+) meson is stationary.\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless, `M_nu` = 0.\n\nFor simplicity in calculations, we will use units where the speed of light `c = 1`. Therefore, mass and energy can be expressed in the same unit (MeV).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):** Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    `E_i = M_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`).\n    `E_f = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   By conservation of energy: `E_i = E_f`\n    `M_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n    `139.6 = E_mu + E_nu`  (Equation 1)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_i):** Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its momentum is zero.\n    `p_i = 0`\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_f):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (`p_mu`) and the neutrino (`p_nu`).\n    `p_f = p_mu + p_nu`\n\n*   By conservation of momentum: `p_i = p_f`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `M` of a particle are related by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M*c^2)^2`\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):**\n    `E_mu^2 = p^2 + M_mu^2` (since `c=1`)\n\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** Since the neutrino is massless (`M_nu = 0`), its energy is given by:\n    `E_nu^2 = p^2 + 0^2  => E_nu = p`\n    For a massless particle, the kinetic energy `KE_nu` is equal to its total energy `E_nu`.\n    `KE_nu = E_nu = p`\n\n**4. Solving for the Energies**\nNow we have a system of equations to solve. We can express the momentum `p` in terms of the energies.\nFrom the neutrino's relation, we have `p = E_nu`.\nSubstitute this into the muon's energy relation:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + M_mu^2` (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 1, we have `E_nu = M_pi - E_mu`. Substitute this into Equation 2:\n`E_mu^2 = (M_pi - E_mu)^2 + M_mu^2`\n\nExpand the equation:\n`E_mu^2 = M_pi^2 - 2 * M_pi * E_mu + E_mu^2 + M_mu^2`\n\nThe `E_mu^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`0 = M_pi^2 - 2 * M_pi * E_mu + M_mu^2`\n\nNow, solve for the total energy of the muon, `E_mu`:\n`2 * M_pi * E_mu = M_pi^2 + M_mu^2`\n`E_mu = (M_pi^2 + M_mu^2) / (2 * M_pi)`\n\n**5. Calculation**\nLet's plug in the given mass values:\n*   `E_mu = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n*   `E_mu = (19488.16 + 11172.49) / 279.2`\n*   `E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.816 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) is the difference between its total energy and its rest mass energy:\n*   `KE_mu = E_mu - M_mu`\n*   `KE_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNow, let's find the energy of the neutrino (`E_nu`) using Equation 1:\n*   `E_nu = M_pi - E_mu`\n*   `E_nu = 139.6 - 109.816 ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`) is equal to its total energy:\n*   `KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nRounding the results, we get:\n*   `KE_mu` ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   `KE_nu` ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values match option C.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2\nM_pi = 139.6  # Mass of Pi(+)\nM_mu = 105.7  # Mass of mu(+)\n\n# The Pi(+) is stationary.\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\n# Formula derived from conservation of energy and momentum: E_mu = (M_pi^2 + M_mu^2) / (2 * M_pi)\nE_mu = (M_pi**2 + M_mu**2) / (2 * M_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - M_mu\n\n# The total energy of the neutrino (E_nu) is found from energy conservation: E_nu = M_pi - E_mu\nE_nu = M_pi - E_mu\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy (KE_nu) is equal to its total energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Print the kinetic energies of the product particles, rounded to two decimal places.\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78). The pair of values is {4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV}.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of relativistic particle physics.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), `M_pi = 139.6 MeV/c^2`\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), `M_mu = 105.7 MeV/c^2`\n*   The Pi(+) meson is stationary.\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered to have zero rest mass, `M_nu = 0`.\n\nFor calculations, we will use units where `c=1`, so mass and energy are both measured in MeV.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`) = `M_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\nThe total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`).\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`) = `E_mu + E_nu`\n\nBy the conservation of energy:\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`139.6 = E_mu + E_nu`  ---(1)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay is zero because the pion is stationary.\n*   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`) = 0\n\nThe total momentum after the decay is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (`p_mu`) and the neutrino (`p_nu`).\n*   Final Momentum (`p_final`) = `p_mu + p_nu`\n\nBy the conservation of momentum:\n`p_initial = p_final`\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu`\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n`|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `M` is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu^2 = p^2 + M_mu^2`\n*   For the massless neutrino (nu): `E_nu^2 = p^2 + 0^2  => E_nu = p`\n\n**4. Solving the System of Equations:**\nWe can now solve for the unknown energies.\nFrom the neutrino's energy-momentum relation, we have `p = E_nu`.\nSubstitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n`E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + M_mu^2`\n\nFrom the conservation of energy (Equation 1), we have `E_nu = 139.6 - E_mu`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n`E_mu^2 = (139.6 - E_mu)^2 + M_mu^2`\n`E_mu^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 * E_mu + E_mu^2 + M_mu^2`\n\nThe `E_mu^2` terms cancel out. Now, we solve for `E_mu`:\n`0 = 139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 * E_mu + 105.7^2`\n`2 * 139.6 * E_mu = 139.6^2 + 105.7^2`\n`E_mu = (139.6^2 + 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`E_mu = (19488.16 + 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2`\n`E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV`\n\nThis is the total energy of the muon. Its kinetic energy (`KE_mu`) is the total energy minus its rest energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - M_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV`\n\nNow, we find the energy of the neutrino using Equation 1:\n`E_nu = 139.6 - E_mu = 139.6 - 109.816 = 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nFor a massless particle like the neutrino, its kinetic energy (`KE_nu`) is equal to its total energy:\n`KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nSo, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option C.\n\nThe Python code execution confirmed these calculations:\n*   KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nFinal Answer: The calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
