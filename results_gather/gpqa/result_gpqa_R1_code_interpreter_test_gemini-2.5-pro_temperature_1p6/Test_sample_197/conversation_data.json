    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The cobalt-containing species are:\n    *   Free Co(II) ions: `[Co(H2O)6]^2+`, which we'll denote as `Co^2+`\n    *   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    *   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Define the total concentration of cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of each species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Determine the fraction of the desired complex:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`. The fraction of this complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `Fraction of [Co(SCN)2] = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `Fraction = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    `Fraction = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as long as the free ligand concentration is known.\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n    *   **Numerator**: `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        *   `1`\n        *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n        *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n        *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Now, we can find the fraction and the percentage.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation accurately.\n```python\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given ligand concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the MLn species is:\n# fraction_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i for i=1 to N))\n# We want to find the fraction for n=2, [Co(SCN)2].\n\n# Numerator for the [Co(SCN)2] species\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Denominator is the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4\n# (beta_0 is defined as 1)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n16.916180326482278\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
