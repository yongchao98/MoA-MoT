    "An analysis of the problem of a hydrogen atom decaying from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions.\n\n### 1. Identify the Process and States\n*   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n*   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s state (ground state).\n*   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    The decay path is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{1st transition}} |n', l', m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{2nd transition}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. Apply Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ is arbitrary, but for spontaneous emission (decay), energy must be released, so the energy of the final state must be lower. For the Hydrogen atom, energy depends primarily on $n$, so typically $n' < n$.\n\n### 3. Determine the Intermediate State\nLet's apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n*   **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state has $l=0, m=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   For a decay process, $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   We know from the first step that the intermediate state has $l'=1$ and $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The final state has $l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m' = 0, \\pm 1$, which is consistent with our findings from the first transition.\n    *   For decay, the final state must have lower energy, so $1 < n'$.\n\n*   **Combining constraints on n':**\n    From the first transition, we need $n' < 3$. From the second transition, we need $n' > 1$. The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both is $n'=2$.\n    Therefore, the intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This corresponds to the 2p subshell. The possible decay routes are:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes proposed in the options A, B, and D are valid according to the selection rules. The task now is to find the associated probability.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route refers to its branching ratio, which is the fraction of decays that proceed through that particular channel. The overall probability of a two-step cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n$P(\\text{route}) = BR(\\text{step 1}) \\times BR(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Branching Ratio of the first step: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (3s state) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay to each of the three degenerate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is equally likely.\n    The total probability of transitioning from the 3s state to any of the 2p states is 1 (assuming this is the only available decay path, which is true for the first step of this cascade).\n    So, the probability of transitioning to any single specific $m'$ state is:\n    $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    (A more rigorous calculation of the transition rates confirms that $W(3s \\to 2p_{m=-1}) = W(3s \\to 2p_{m=0}) = W(3s \\to 2p_{m=1})$).\n\n*   **Branching Ratio of the second step: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (a 2p state), it needs to decay further. We must consider all possible final states allowed by the E1 selection rules.\n    From $l=1$, transitions can go to $l=0$ or $l=2$. A transition to $l=2$ is not possible because it would require $n \\geq 3$, which would be an excitation, not a decay. The only possible decay is to an $l=0$ state. The only $l=0$ state with energy lower than $n=2$ is the $n=1, l=0$ state, which is our target final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    Since there is only one possible decay channel from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the branching ratio for this transition is 1.\n    $BR(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a single cascade route**\n    The probability for any one of the specific routes, e.g., via $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P = BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    This probability is the same for the routes going through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    The route is valid, and the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option is correct.\n\n*   **C) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    Assuming a typo for $|3,0,0\\rangle$ at the beginning, the route is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$. This option is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
