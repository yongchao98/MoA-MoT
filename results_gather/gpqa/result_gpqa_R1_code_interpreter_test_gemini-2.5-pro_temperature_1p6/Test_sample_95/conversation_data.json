For this formula to be valid, the angle θ must be in radians.\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius (Rs):** The event horizon of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole is a sphere with a radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius. The diameter is `D = 2 * Rs`.\n*   **Area of a Sphere:** The area (A) of the event horizon is given by `A = 4 * π * Rs²`.\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The formula is:\n    `S = (k_B * A * c³) / (4 * ħ * G)`\n    where:\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (~1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light (~3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (~1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant (~6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻²).\n\n**3.
