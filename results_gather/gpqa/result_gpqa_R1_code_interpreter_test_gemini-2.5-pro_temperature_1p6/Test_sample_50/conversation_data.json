    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a common technique in electrostatics for problems involving conductors.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Problem Setup:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (V = 0).\n    *   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:**\n    *   The presence of the charge `q` induces a distribution of surface charge on the conducting sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the point charge `q` and the field from this induced surface charge.\n    *   The method of images allows us to replace the complicated induced surface charge distribution with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of V=0 on the surface of the sphere (at radius r=R).\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is:\n        *   Magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Position: `b = R^2/d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:**\n    *   The potential energy of a system of charges and conductors can be calculated as `U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n    *   In our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. The sphere itself has a potential of 0, so it doesn't contribute to the sum directly.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the system is given by:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere.\n    *   The beauty of the method of images is that this `V_induced` is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating `V_induced`:**\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at position `b`.\n    *   The real charge `q` is at position `d`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge and the image charge is `distance = d - b`.\n    *   Let's substitute the value of `b`:\n        `distance = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now, we can find the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` due to `q'`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / distance`\n        where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`k = 1 / (4πε₀)`).\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `distance`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator cancel out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation of Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   Now, we plug this `V_induced` back into our energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   Simplifying the expression gives:\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated expression is `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has R²)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n    C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\n\nThe reasoning is purely analytical and does not require a computational step. The derivation leads directly to the answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
