    "Here is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the product's NMR spectra to determine its structure.**\n\nThe problem provides the theoretical ¹H and ¹³C NMR data for the product of the reaction. The starting material, Compound X, has the formula C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction is an isomerization, so the product also has the formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n1.  **Formula Verification:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Integrations are 3H + 3H + 1H + 2H + 1H + 2H = 12H. This matches the hydrogen count in C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The number of carbon signals is 9, but two signals correspond to 2 carbons each (`126.9 (2C)`, `129.1 (2C)`), so the total carbon count is 1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11C. This matches the carbon count.\n    *   The reaction is indeed an isomerization of compound X.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   For C₁₁H₁₂O, DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6.\n\n3.  **Interpreting the NMR data to build structural fragments:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR `δ 197.7 (1C, s)`:** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, most likely a ketone. This accounts for the oxygen atom and one DBE.\n    *   **Aromatic/Vinyl Region:** The presence of many signals in the `δ 126-145` (¹³C) and `δ 6.7-7.8` (¹H) regions, along with the high DBE of 6, strongly suggests a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and a C=C double bond (1 DBE). Total DBE = 1 (C=O) + 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) = 6. This is consistent.\n    *   **¹H NMR Methyl Groups `δ 2.28 (3H, s)` and `δ 2.31 (3H, s)`:** The presence of two sharp singlets for 3 protons each indicates two methyl (-CH₃) groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This means they are attached to quaternary carbons (e.g., C=O, C=C, or a substituted aromatic carbon).\n    *   **¹H NMR Aromatic/Vinyl Protons:**\n        *   The signals at `δ 7.08 (2H, d)` and `δ 7.71 (2H, d)` form a classic AA'BB' pattern, which is highly characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The signals at `δ 6.75 (1H, d)` and `δ 7.68 (1H, d)` are characteristic of two vinylic protons on a double bond (`-CH=CH-`) that are coupled to each other.\n\n4.  **Assembling the fragments:**\n    *   We have the following pieces:\n        1.  A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        2.  A ketone group (`>C=O`).\n        3.  A vinylene group (`-CH=CH-`).\n        4.  Two methyl groups, both appearing as singlets.\n    *   Let's try to assemble them. One of the methyl singlets can be the substituent on the *para*-disubstituted ring, forming a *p*-tolyl group (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-`). This accounts for one methyl singlet and the `2H+2H` doublet pattern in the aromatic region.\n    *   The other methyl group must also be a singlet. A common fragment that gives a methyl singlet is an acetyl group (`-C(=O)CH₃`).\n    *   Let's see if we can combine these pieces: `p-tolyl`, `-CH=CH-`, and `-C(=O)CH₃`.\n    *   Connecting them gives the structure: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   Let's check if this structure, **5-(4-methylphenyl)pent-3-en-2-one**, is consistent with all the data.\n        *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. Correct.\n        *   **p-tolyl-CH₃:** Gives a singlet. (Matches `δ 2.31`).\n        *   **-C(=O)-CH₃:** Gives a singlet. (Matches `δ 2.28`). This works perfectly for the two methyl singlets.\n        *   ***p*-tolyl aromatic protons:** Gives two doublets for 2H each. (Matches `δ 7.08` and `δ 7.71`).\n        *   **-CH=CH- protons:** The two protons are coupled to each other and nothing else, so they should appear as two doublets. (Matches `δ 6.75` and `δ 7.68`). The chemical shifts are also reasonable for a conjugated enone system. The proton β to the carbonyl (`-C₆H₄-CH=`) is more deshielded (`δ 7.68`) than the proton α to the carbonyl (`=CH-C=O`) (`δ 6.75`).\n\nThe structure of the product is confidently identified as 5-(4-methylphenyl)pent-3-en-2-one.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the reaction to determine Compound X.**\n\nThe reaction involves treating an epoxide (based on the options) with a non-nucleophilic base (DABCO) at high temperature. This is characteristic of a **vinyloxirane rearrangement**. In this reaction, a vinylic epoxide (an epoxide ring attached to a C=C bond) rearranges to form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\nThe general mechanism involves abstraction of the most acidic proton, which is the one on the epoxide carbon that is also allylic to the double bond. This leads to a resonance-stabilized carbanion (dienolate), which then rearranges and is protonated to give the final ketone.\n\nProduct: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n\nLet's test which of the starting material options would lead to this product. The options for Compound X are all isomers with formula C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n*   **Candidate B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**\n    *   Structure: `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`\n    *   Rearrangement would yield `Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-C(=O)-CH₃`. This product has a phenyl group (not a *p*-tolyl group) and different vinyl/methyl connectivity. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Candidate C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**\n    *   Structure: `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`\n    *   Rearrangement would yield `Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃`. This product has a phenyl group (not *p*-tolyl) and an ethyl ketone (not a methyl ketone). **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Candidate D: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** (also known as 2-(2-(4-methylphenyl)ethenyl)oxirane)\n    *   Structure: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`\n    *   Let's follow the mechanism:\n        1.  DABCO abstracts the most acidic proton: the one on the epoxide carbon that is allylic to the double bond.\n            `p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` → `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH₂`\n        2.  The epoxide ring opens to form a stable dienolate anion.\n            `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH₂` → `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(O⁻)=CH₂`\n        3.  Upon workup (or from residual acidic species), the enolate is protonated at the terminal carbon.\n            `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(O⁻)=CH₂` → `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    *   This resulting product, 5-(4-methylphenyl)pent-3-en-2-one, is exactly the structure we deduced from the NMR data. **Correct.**\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
