    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the compounds and evaluate the given statements.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A and B**\n*   Compound A has the molecular formula C₃H₆. This formula can represent either propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) or cyclopropane.\n*   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br₂/CCl₄), a classic test for unsaturation. Both propene and cyclopropane can react, but the subsequent reactions strongly suggest an alkene pathway.\n*   **Assuming A is propene:** Propene undergoes an addition reaction with bromine.\n    CH₃-CH=CH₂ (Propene, A) + Br₂ --(CCl₄)--> CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂Br (1,2-Dibromopropane, B)\n*   **Compound A = Propene**\n*   **Compound B = 1,2-Dibromopropane**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound C**\n*   Compound B (1,2-Dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This reagent causes dehydrohalogenation (elimination of HBr). With two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, two molecules of HBr are eliminated to form an alkyne.\n    CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂Br (B) + 2 alc. KOH → CH₃-C≡CH (Propyne, C) + 2 KBr + 2 H₂O\n*   **Compound C = Propyne**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound D**\n*   Compound C (Propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a classic reaction for the cyclic polymerization of alkynes. Three molecules of propyne will trimerize.\n    3 CH₃-C≡CH (C) --(Red hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene, D)\n*   **Compound D = Mesitylene**\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound E**\n*   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This typically refers to the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO₃ + concentrated H₂SO₄) used for the nitration of aromatic rings. The methyl groups are activating and ortho-, para-directing.\n    Mesitylene (D) + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E)\n*   **Compound E = 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene**\n\n**Step 5: Identify Compound F**\n*   Compound E (a nitro compound) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard reducing agent for converting an aromatic nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂).\n    2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E) --(Fe/HCl)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesidine, F)\n*   **Compound F = 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**\n\n**Step 6: Identify Compound G**\n*   Compound F (a primary aromatic amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂, typically from NaNO₂/HCl at 0-5 °C). This is a diazotization reaction.\n    2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (F) + HNO₂ → Mesitylenediazonium salt (G)\n*   **Compound G = Mesitylenediazonium salt**\n\n**Step 7: Identify Compound H**\n*   Compound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). While various reactions are possible, a common one, especially upon gentle warming in an aqueous solution, is the replacement of the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) to form a phenol. The NaOH ensures the medium is basic.\n    Mesitylenediazonium salt (G) --(H₂O, warm / OH⁻)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol (H)\n*   **Compound H = 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.**\n*   Compound C is propyne. Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, meaning it is a gas at room temperature. As a small hydrocarbon, it is indeed flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n*   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce a violet, purple, or green colored complex with neutral FeCl₃ solution.\n*   However, phenols with bulky groups (like methyl groups) at both positions ortho to the -OH group are sterically hindered. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored iron complex.\n*   Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol does not give a positive ferric chloride test. Since the aqueous FeCl₃ solution is itself yellow-brown, a negative test means the solution remains yellow. The statement \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because it implies a positive reaction producing a yellow product, which is incorrect. A positive test for phenols is not yellow. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n*   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (aniline and its derivatives) are fundamentally important starting materials for producing a vast range of azo dyes. They are diazotized (like in Step 6) and then coupled to another aromatic molecule to form the dye. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.**\n*   Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n*   All nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, which is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   All three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce another single signal, also a singlet.\n*   Therefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of mesitylene consists of two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
