    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we have a benzene ring with two groups attached, which can be represented as X-C₆H₄-Y. The core C₆H₄ part contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens to the formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The spectrum shows \"absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group.\" An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six chemically distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the C₆H₄ core of a di-substituted benzene ring (e.g., ortho, meta, or para substitution).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** These are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   One is a **doublet (d)**, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**, meaning it's coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group, giving the quartet).\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **prop-1-en-1-yl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). Let's call the protons Hₐ and Hₙ: `R-CHₐ=CHₙ-CH₃`. Hₐ is split by Hₙ into a doublet. Hₙ is split by Hₐ into a doublet and by the -CH₃ group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment contributes C₃H₅ to the formula.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One -CH₃ group is part of the prop-1-en-1-yl fragment identified above.\n        *   The second -CH₃ group must be elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), etc.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments:**\n    *   We have the benzene ring core: C₆H₄.\n    *   We have one substituent, the prop-1-en-1-yl group: -C₃H₅.\n    *   We need to determine the second substituent. It must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second -CH₃ group. Given the \"no -CH₂\" rule, the simplest way to form an ester is to make it a methyl ester. There are two possibilities for how the atoms are connected:\n        *   **Possibility 1: Methoxycarbonyl group** (-COOCH₃). Here, the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon. This fragment's formula is C₂H₃O₂.\n        *   **Possibility 2: Acetoxy group** (-OCOCH₃). Here, the benzene ring is attached to the ester oxygen. This fragment's formula is also C₂H₃O₂.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n    We can now sum the atoms from the core and the two substituents for both possibilities.\n    *   **For Possibility 1 (e.g., Methyl p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):**\n        *   Carbon: 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from COOCH₃) = 11\n        *   Hydrogen: 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from COOCH₃) = 12\n        *   Oxygen: 2 (from COOCH₃) = 2\n        *   The formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n    *   **For Possibility 2 (e.g., p-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate):**\n        *   Carbon: 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from OCOCH₃) = 11\n        *   Hydrogen: 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from OCOCH₃) = 12\n        *   Oxygen: 2 (from OCOCH₃) = 2\n        *   The formula is also **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nBoth structures that are consistent with all the spectroscopic data lead to the same molecular formula.\n\n6.  **Verify with a Python Script:**\nThe logic can be confirmed by a simple script that calculates the formula from the identified fragments.\n```python\n# Define the atoms in each fragment based on the analysis\nbenzene_ring_core = {'C': 6, 'H': 4, 'O': 0}\nsubstituent_1_propenyl = {'C': 3, 'H': 5, 'O': 0}\n# The second substituent must contain the ester (-COO) and the second methyl (-CH3)\n# The only way to do this with no -CH2- groups is as -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3\nsubstituent_2_ester_methyl = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2} \n\n# Sum the atoms\ntotal_C = benzene_ring_core['C'] + substituent_1_propenyl['C'] + substituent_2_ester_methyl['C']\ntotal_H = benzene_ring_core['H'] + substituent_1_propenyl['H'] + substituent_2_ester_methyl['H']\ntotal_O = benzene_ring_core['O'] + substituent_1_propenyl['O'] + substituent_2_ester_methyl['O']\n\n# Construct the formula string\nmolecular_formula = f\"C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}\"\n\nprint(f\"The calculated molecular formula is: {molecular_formula}\")\n```\n>>>\n```\nThe calculated molecular formula is: C11H12O2\n```\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\nThe detailed analysis of the provided FTIR and ¹H NMR data, combined with the structural constraints, consistently points to a molecular formula of C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
