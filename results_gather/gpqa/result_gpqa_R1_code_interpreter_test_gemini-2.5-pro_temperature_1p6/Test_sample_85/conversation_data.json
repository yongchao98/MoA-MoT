    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is an enantiomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center is at carbon 4 (C4), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Reaction A yields the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n    *   Reaction B yields the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided for the starting materials A and B are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n    *   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid).\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-CO-O-iBu) at the other end (C5).\n    *   An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to C3. This C3 is a chiral center.\n    *   The general structure is:\n        ```\n              O                O\n             //               //\n        HO--C(1)--CH2(2)--CH(3)--CH2(4)--C(5)--O-CH2CH(CH3)2\n                           |\n                           CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   The key point is that the chiral center in the starting material (C3) corresponds to the chiral center in the product (C4 of the lactone ring). We need to determine if the reaction pathway preserves the stereochemistry at this center.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces aldehydes, ketones, and esters, but it is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, in the given starting material, **LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group**.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        `A --> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid)\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group (C1) and the newly formed alcohol group (C5). This forms the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 (carboxylation) and C5 (reduction). The chiral center at C3 is not involved in bond-making or bond-breaking. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration is **retained** throughout the reaction.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)-enantiomer** and the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material A must also be the **(R)-enantiomer**.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in **reducing carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, often in the presence of esters, which react much more slowly.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        `B --> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate)\n    2.  The subsequent step involves intramolecular transesterification. The alcohol group attacks the carbonyl of the ester group, forming the six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 (reduction) and C5 (transesterification). Again, the chiral center at C3 is not involved. Its stereochemical configuration is **retained**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the **(S)-enantiomer** and the stereochemistry is retained, the starting material B must also be the **(S)-enantiomer**.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **4. Final Summary**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)-enantiomer** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n*   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)-enantiomer** to produce the (S)-lactone.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
