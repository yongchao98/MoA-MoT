    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($T_2 / T_1$).\n    *   **Method:** The planets were detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the Doppler shift of the host star's light.\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        *   Star masses are equal: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n        *   Planet masses are similar: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$. (Specifically, the observed minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$, is similar).\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n        *   Wavelength shift for system 1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ.\n        *   Wavelength shift for system 2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n        $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physical Formula:**\n    *   The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by a formula that connects it to the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), the orbital inclination ($i$), and the orbital period ($T$).\n    *   The formula can be derived from the conservation of momentum and Kepler's Third Law. The final, simplified expression (for $M_{star} \\gg m_p$) is:\n        $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    *   This formula shows how the observable $K$ depends on the system parameters.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio and Simplify:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. Let's set up a ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}}$\n    *   Now, we use the given information to cancel terms:\n        *   The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant and cancels out.\n        *   \"stars with exactly the same masses\": $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$, so the $M_{star}^{2/3}$ terms cancel.\n        *   \"planets...with masses similar\": In RV measurements, the quantity determined is the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. So we assume $(m_p \\sin i)_1 \\approx (m_p \\sin i)_2$. These terms cancel.\n    *   After simplification, the equation becomes:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Target Ratio ($T_2/T_1$):**\n    *   We have the relation: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find $T_2/T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        *   Cube both sides: $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$\n        *   Invert both sides to get the desired ratio: $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values for $K_1$ and $K_2$ (which are proportional to the given wavelength shifts):\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The final step is to compute the numerical value of the ratio.\n\n```python\n# All given parameters (star mass, planet minimum mass) are the same for both systems except for the period and RV semi-amplitude.\n# The relationship between RV semi-amplitude (K) and orbital period (T) is K ∝ T^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3) = (T1/T2)^(1/3).\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the observed wavelength shift (Δλ).\n# So, K2/K1 = Δλ2/Δλ1 = 7/5.\n# We want to find the ratio of the periods, T2/T1.\n# From the relation above: T2/T1 = (K2/K1)^(-3) = (K1/K2)^3.\n# We have K1/K2 = 5/7.\n\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T1 = (5 / 7) ** 3\nprint(period_ratio_T2_over_T1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio $T_2/T_1$ is approximately 0.36. This matches option D. The fact that the ratio is less than 1 means the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1, which is consistent with its larger radial velocity signal.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the orbital periods ($T_2/T_1$) for two exoplanets. Let's break down the physics and the given information.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum change in the star's velocity along our line of sight is called the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n\nThe observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to this radial velocity. Specifically, $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v}{c}$, where $v$ is the star's velocity. Therefore, the maximum wavelength shift is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude $K$:\n$\\Delta\\lambda_{max} \\propto K$\n\nThis means the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the measured wavelength shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n**2. Relate RV Semi-amplitude to Orbital Period**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the host star is given by the formula:\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe term $m_p \\sin i$ is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is what is actually constrained by RV measurements.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems**\n\nWe can write the equation for each system:\n$K_1 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}$\n$K_2 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}$\n\nNow, let's form a ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{star2}^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{star1}^{2/3}}}$\n\n**4. Simplify Using the Given Information**\n\n*   \"two stars with exactly the same masses\": $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$. The $M_{star}^{2/3}$ terms cancel.\n*   \"one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune\": In the context of RV measurements, this implies the measured minimum masses are similar. So, we assume $m_{p1} \\sin i_1 \\approx m_{p2} \\sin i_2$. These terms cancel.\n*   The term $(2\\pi G)^{1/3}$ is a constant and also cancels.\n\nAfter simplification, the equation becomes:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**5. Solve for the Period Ratio ($T_2/T_1$)**\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for $T_2/T_1$:\n1.  Invert both sides: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{1/3}$\n2.  Cube both sides to isolate the period ratio: $\\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{T_2}{T_1}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nWe know that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, which means $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\nSubstituting this into our final equation:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\nLet's compute this value.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods T2/T1 is related to the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K1/K2\n# by the formula: T2/T1 = (K1/K2)^3.\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the observed wavelength shift Δλ.\n# Therefore, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2.\n# Given: Δλ1 = 5 mÅ and Δλ2 = 7 mÅ.\n\nratio_K1_over_K2 = 5 / 7\nratio_T2_over_T1 = ratio_K1_over_K2 ** 3\n\nprint(ratio_T2_over_T1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.

    "The thinking process and calculation have already been performed and verified. The logic is sound, and the computation is correct.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the measured periodic wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is $K_2/K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7/5$.\n\n2.  The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$ when the star's mass and the planet's minimum mass ($m_p \\sin i$) are constant, which is the case here.\n\n3.  From this proportionality, we get the relationship: $K_2/K_1 = (T_2/T_1)^{-1/3} = (T_1/T_2)^{1/3}$.\n\n4.  We want to find the ratio $T_2/T_1$. By rearranging the formula, we get $T_2/T_1 = (K_1/K_2)^3$.\n\n5.  Substituting the known values: $T_2/T_1 = (5/7)^3$.\n\n6.  The calculation gives $T_2/T_1 \\approx 0.3644$.\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
