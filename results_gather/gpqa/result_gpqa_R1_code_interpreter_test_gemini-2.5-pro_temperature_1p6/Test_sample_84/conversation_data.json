    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_{*}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{*}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{*}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to compute the ratio for the two planets.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_{*}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_{*}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{*}$ and $R_{*}$ are identical for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Parameters to Observational Data:** The semi-major axes ($a_1, a_2$) are not given directly. However, we have information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude ($K_*$) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and assuming the system is viewed edge-on (sin(i)≈1, a good assumption for transiting planets), the formula is:\n    $K_{*} = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n    Where $M_*$ is the star's mass and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express `a` in terms of the other variables.\n    $K_{*}^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\right) = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K_{*}^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{ \\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_* K_{*2}^2} }{ \\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_* K_{*1}^2} }$\n    The constants G and $M_*$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_{*2}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_{*1}^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_{*1}}{K_{*2}} \\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Ratios from Given Data:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $M_{p1} = 7 M_{earth}$, $M_{p2} = 5 M_{earth}$\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio ($K_{*1}/K_{*2}$):** The RV semi-amplitude is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$).\n        $K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n        Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_{*1}}{K_{*2}} = \\frac{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}}{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n        Given $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å:\n        $\\frac{K_{*1}}{K_{*2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute the Ratios to find ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio formula from step 4.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n    I will use a short Python script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 9: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K_s1/K_s2)^2\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = 5 / 7\nrv_ratio_1_over_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate (a2/a1)\na2_over_a1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1**2) * (rv_ratio_1_over_2**2)\n\n# Step 10: Calculate the temperature ratio\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio=}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_{*}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{*}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{*}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_{*}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{*} \\left( \\frac{R_{*}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{*}$ and $R_{*}$ are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, the terms $T_{*}$, $R_{*}$, and $(1-A)^{1/4}$ cancel out.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. We can derive this from the information provided by the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_*$) is given by:\n\n$K_{*} = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nLet's solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K_{*}^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K_{*}^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_* K_{*2}^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_* K_{*1}^2}} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_{*2}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_{*1}^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_{*1}}{K_{*2}}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K_*$ is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$, via the formula $K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_{*1}}{K_{*2}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nLet's plug these into the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5 M_{Earth}}{7 M_{Earth}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
