    "An uncharged spherical conductor has a charge placed inside a cavity within it. We need to determine the electric field at a point outside the conductor. This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** A positive charge, $+q$, is placed inside the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, for the electric field to be zero within the conducting material, a charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This induced charge distributes itself non-uniformly on the cavity's inner wall to perfectly cancel the electric field from the charge $+q$ within the conducting material.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of $-q$ has been drawn to the inner surface of the cavity from the conductor's free electrons, a net charge of $+q$ is left behind on the conductor. This excess charge of $+q$ will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor to be as far apart as possible.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a closed conducting shell shields its exterior from the electrostatic fields of charges located inside it. The combined electric field produced by the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity. This is because the conductor acts as a shield. The field lines originating from the $+q$ charge terminate on the $-q$ induced charge on the inner wall, and no field lines from this internal configuration penetrate into or beyond the conducting material.\n\n4.  **Field Outside the Conductor:** Since the net electric field from the charges inside the cavity is zero outside the conductor, the only source for the electric field at point P is the charge residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** We have established that a total charge of $+q$ resides on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external charges in the vicinity, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The internal non-uniformities (the off-center cavity and charge) do not affect the distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to the Shell Theorem (a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge $+q$ located at O. The magnitude of this field is given by Coulomb's Law:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The problem provides extra information, such as the cavity's radius ($r$), its distance from the center ($s$), the distance of P from the cavity's center ($l$), and an angle ($\\theta$). This information is irrelevant to finding the field outside the conductor and is included to test the understanding of the shielding principle.\n    *   The derived expression for the electric field, $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$, matches option B exactly.\n\nFinal conclusion is based on the robust principles of charge induction and electrostatic shielding. The conductor effectively hides the complex arrangement of charges within it and presents a simple, uniform charge distribution on its outer surface, which dictates the external electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
