    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's deconstruct the provided spectral data for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options satisfy this.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. This means their contributions to the total proton integration are equal.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with an integration ratio of 1:1. This indicates there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the number of protons for each type is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons (from methyl or ethyl groups) that are not coupled to other protons. The total number of protons in this region is distributed in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number and type of signals it would produce in a 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent by reflection across the plane. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives a **second singlet** (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (its environment is different from C2). This gives a **third singlet** (3H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives a **second singlet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H; ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals will not be singlets due to spin-spin coupling in the ethyl groups.\n        *   The four methylene (-CH2-) protons are equivalent and are split by the -CH3 group, producing **one quartet** (4H).\n        *   The six methyl (-CH3) protons are equivalent and are split by the -CH2- group, producing **one triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n    *   The spectrum shows **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**.\n    *   A mixture containing 1,4-diethylbenzene with any of the tetramethylbenzenes would produce two aromatic singlets with a 4H:2H ratio (i.e., 2:1), which does not match.\n    *   The alkyl signals for 1,4-diethylbenzene are a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n    *   Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture**, which eliminates option **B**.\n    *   Any 1:1 mixture of the other three compounds (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) will produce two aromatic singlets (one from each compound) with a 2H:2H ratio (i.e., 1:1), which matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n    *   The spectrum shows **three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of alkyl protons is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24H means the integrations for the three signals must be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   We need to find the pair of compounds that, when combined, give alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is not three signals with integrations {12H, 6H, 6H}. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   Combined signals: This gives a total of three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n    *   The aromatic region is also consistent, providing two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (2H from Durene and 2H from Prehnitene).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
