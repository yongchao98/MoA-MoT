    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the two reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael Addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The C2 carbon is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon has one proton and is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The t-BuOK will remove the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule (`CH2=CH-COOEt`).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Workup:** A proton source (like t-BuOH, formed from the base, or an added mild acid during workup) protonates the intermediate anion to yield the final product, A.\n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The final product has the cyclohexanone core with the original substituents, plus a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group attached at the C6 position.\n    *   Let's analyze the IUPAC name provided in the options. The product is named as a substituted propanoate: `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   This means the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment point on the ring is designated as C1 of the substituent name.\n    *   Let's number the ring according to this naming convention:\n        *   C1 is the attachment point to the propanoate chain (this is C6 from the original ketone). It also has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has the carbonyl group (=O) (this is C1 from the original ketone).\n        *   C3 has the ethyl and methyl groups (this is C2 from the original ketone).\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituent name is **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options B and C.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael Addition. The base KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, creating a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate anion). This anion then attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂`), as this is the most acidic position.\n    *   The resulting nucleophile is `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`) attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n    *   Structure after addition and before protonation: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN`\n\n4.  **Workup:** The intermediate carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product, B.\n    *   Final product structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n\n5.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The longest chain is six carbons long: `C₆H₃-C₅H₂-C₄H(NO₂)-C₃H(CH₃)-C₂H₂-C₁N`.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options B and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these conclusions with the given options, only option B contains both correct product names.\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile **(Correct A, Correct B)**\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
