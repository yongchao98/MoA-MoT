    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most abundant isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. Its relative intensity is 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The presence of an M⁺ and M⁺+2 peak with an intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing **one chlorine atom**. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine's isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n\nLet's verify the molecular weight for the proposed structures, all of which are isomers with the formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n*   Mass with ³⁵Cl isotope: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = **156**. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   Mass with ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 37 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = **158**. This matches the M⁺+2 peak.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options fit this criterion.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is an acid chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde and a phenol. It would not show the characteristic very broad O-H of a carboxylic acid or the specific proton NMR signal.\n    *   We are left with **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)**\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**\n*   **Interpretation:** The aromatic region shows a highly symmetrical pattern. There are a total of 4 aromatic protons, but they give only two signals. Each signal represents two chemically equivalent protons, and each is a doublet. This pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In a para-substituted ring, the two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are equivalent. This symmetry leads to the simple \"two doublets\" pattern.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining two options based on the NMR data:\n\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It would exhibit the exact symmetrical pattern seen in the NMR spectrum: two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, plus the carboxylic acid proton signal. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and would correspond to the 8.02 ppm signal, while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom would correspond to the 7.72 ppm signal. This is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). In this structure, all four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments. This would lead to a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four distinct signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that is consistent with all the provided mass spec, IR, and ¹H NMR data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
