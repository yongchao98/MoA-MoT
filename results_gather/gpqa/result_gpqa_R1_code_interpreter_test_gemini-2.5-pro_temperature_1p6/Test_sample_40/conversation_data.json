    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, also known as the Einstein velocity addition formula.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   **Lab Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of the observer.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame moving with the glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (S' frame) relative to the lab (S frame). The problem states the glass is moving at velocity `v`.\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured within the glass (in the S' frame). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since we are given `c=1`, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The problem states the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, so `u'` is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the lab (in the S frame). This is what we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We have `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`.\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option B. This formula is a specific case of the Fizeau-Fresnel effect, fully explained by special relativity.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) 1\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nOur derived speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
