    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the dimming effect of starspots due to stellar rotation with the dimming effect of an exoplanet transit. We will equate the two effects to find the required relative radius of the exoplanet.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the brightness variation due to starspots\n\nThe star has two distinct hemispheres: one pristine and one with spots. The photometric variation is observed as the star rotates.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the projected area of the star's disk (`A_star`) and the fourth power of its effective temperature (`Teff`), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`Flux ∝ Area × T⁴`).\n    `F_max ∝ A_star × Teff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. The spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `Teff` = 6000 K.\n    *   Temperature of the spots, `Tspot` = `Teff` - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   The filling factor of spots on this hemisphere, `f` = 20% = 0.20. We assume this factor applies to the projected area of the visible disk.\n\n    The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part of the disk.\n    *   Area of the normal photosphere = `(1 - f) × A_star`\n    *   Area of the spots = `f × A_star`\n\n    `F_min ∝ [(1 - f) × A_star × Teff⁴] + [f × A_star × Tspot⁴]`\n    `F_min ∝ A_star × [(1 - f) × Teff⁴ + f × Tspot⁴]`\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the signal) is calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\n    `Amplitude = (A_star × Teff⁴ - A_star × [(1 - f) × Teff⁴ + f × Tspot⁴]) / (A_star × Teff⁴)`\n\n    By canceling `A_star` and simplifying the numerator:\n    `Numerator = Teff⁴ - (1 - f) × Teff⁴ - f × Tspot⁴`\n    `Numerator = Teff⁴ - Teff⁴ + f × Teff⁴ - f × Tspot⁴`\n    `Numerator = f × (Teff⁴ - Tspot⁴)`\n\n    So, the amplitude is:\n    `Amplitude = (f × (Teff⁴ - Tspot⁴)) / Teff⁴`\n    `Amplitude = f × [1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴]`\n\n### Step 2: Relate the variation to an exoplanet transit\n\nAn exoplanet transit causes a dip in the star's brightness. The depth of this transit (`Depth`) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   Planet's radius = `Rpl`\n*   Star's radius = `Rstar`\n\n`Depth = (π × Rpl²) / (π × Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots should be the same as the amplitude from the hypothetical exoplanet transit.\n\n### Step 3: Equate and solve\n\n`Depth = Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = f × [1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴]`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar`:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt( f × [1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴] )`\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `f` = 0.20\n*   `Teff` = 6000 K\n*   `Tspot` = 5000 K\n\nWe can use a short Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20         # Spot filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0   # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the flux variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is equal to the amplitude\n# So, Rpl/Rstar is the square root of the amplitude.\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_over_Rstar)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3217916931754407\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately `0.3218`. This value is closest to option C.\n\nThe amplitude of the flux variation is:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 × [1 - (5000/6000)⁴] = 0.20 × [1 - (5/6)⁴] ≈ 0.1035`\nThis means the star's brightness varies by about 10.35% due to the spots.\n\nThe relative radius of the exoplanet would be:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 is a very good match for option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An exoplanet transiting its host star causes a dip in the star's observed brightness. This dip, known as the transit depth, is proportional to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Similarly, dark spots on a star's surface can also cause variations in brightness as the star rotates. We need to find the size of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same brightness variation as the described starspots.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the brightness change due to the starspots**\n\nThe total flux (brightness) emitted by a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law, `F ∝ A * T⁴`).\n\nThe problem describes a star with two hemispheres:\n1.  **Unspotted Hemisphere:** Its flux (`F_max`) is proportional to the star's effective temperature (`Teff`). Let's consider the projected disk area `A_disk`.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * Teff⁴`\n\n2.  **Spotted Hemisphere:** This hemisphere is partially covered by cooler, darker spots.\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `Teff` = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, `Tspot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor, `f` = 20% = 0.20\n\n    When this hemisphere faces the observer, a fraction `f` of the disk is at `Tspot` and the remaining `(1 - f)` is at `Teff`. The total flux (`F_min`) is the sum from both areas.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * A_disk * Teff⁴ + f * A_disk * Tspot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n`Amplitude = (A_disk * Teff⁴ - [(1 - f) * A_disk * Teff⁴ + f * A_disk * Tspot⁴]) / (A_disk * Teff⁴)`\n\nWe can cancel `A_disk` from the equation:\n`Amplitude = (Teff⁴ - (1 - f) * Teff⁴ - f * Tspot⁴) / Teff⁴`\n`Amplitude = (Teff⁴ - Teff⁴ + f * Teff⁴ - f * Tspot⁴) / Teff⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * (Teff⁴ - Tspot⁴) / Teff⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴]`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 0.48225]`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.1035`\n\nSo, the brightness of the star varies by about 10.35% due to the rotation and the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the brightness change to an exoplanet transit**\n\nFor a transiting exoplanet, the depth of the transit signal is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n`Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star`\n`Transit Depth = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²)`\n`Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the two effects and solve**\n\nThe problem requires the exoplanet to produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots.\n`Transit Depth = Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.1035`\n\nTo find the relative radius of the planet (`Rpl / Rstar`), we take the square root:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.1035)`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3217`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculated relative radius `Rpl / Rstar` is ~0.32, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
