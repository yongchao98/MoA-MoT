    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which molecules are chiral and are present as a single enantiomer (or a non-racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often due to the presence of one or more stereocenters, but the molecule must lack an overall plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule. The atoms `Cl`, `H` attached to C1, `C1`, `C2`, the methyl `C` on C2, and the methylene `C` of the ethyl group all lie in the same plane defined by the C=C double bond.\n    *   This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. For instance, in the ethyl group, one hydrogen can lie in this plane, and the other two are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule, but we don't need to draw its exact structure.\n    *   The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The `R` and `S` designations are used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers.\n    *   The fact that the name specifies a single, specific stereoisomer means we are considering that molecule in isolation, not as a racemic mixture. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and the `CH(CH3)COOH` group) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   When a molecule has two such stereocenters with identical substituents, the isomer with opposite configurations `(R,S)` or `(S,R)` is a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound is achiral because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Despite having stereocenters, the molecule as a whole is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The configurations are `(R,R)`.\n    *   Its mirror image would be the `(S,S)` stereoisomer. The `(R,R)` and `(S,S)` forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   As a single enantiomer, the `(2R,3R)` compound is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon bearing the -OH group (C1) is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH2-CH2-` (path to C3), and `-CH=CH-` (path to C3).\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` for these constitutionally equivalent positions suggests the most symmetrical isomer, which is the all-`cis` isomer (all three -OH groups on the same side of the ring).\n    *   This all-`cis` isomer possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one `C-OH` group and the opposite `CH2` group.\n    *   Since the molecule has planes of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The name describes a ketone. The main chain is a `butan-1-one`, meaning a four-carbon chain with the carbonyl at C1. C1 is also attached to a cyclopentyl group. A methyl group is on C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for stereocenters. The only potential stereocenter is C3.\n    *   Let's list the four groups attached to C3:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -CH3 (the C4 of the butane chain)\n        3.  -CH3 (the methyl substituent at C3)\n        4.  -CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl (the C2-C1 part of the chain)\n    *   Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl (-CH3) groups (groups 2 and 3), it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other stereocenters and no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCounting the compounds that are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (**Yes**)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (**Yes**)\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (**Yes**)\n\nIn total, there are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
