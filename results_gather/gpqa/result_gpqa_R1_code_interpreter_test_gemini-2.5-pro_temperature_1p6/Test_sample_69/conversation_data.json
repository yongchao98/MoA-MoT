    "I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of compound E. To do this, I must first identify the compounds A through H based on the provided reaction descriptions.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 3 and Identify B, F, and G:**\n    *   `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    *   The regeneration of A suggests that C is an adduct or complex, `A·X`, where the `X` part hydrolyzes. The atoms of `X` must come from substance B.\n    *   The hydrolysis `X + H₂O → F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` is a very specific chemical property. Let's examine potential substances for `X` (and thus for B):\n        *   Hydrolysis of PCl₅ yields HCl (strong acid) and H₃PO₄ (weak acid). This is a perfect match for F and G. If X = PCl₅, its atoms (P, Cl) must come from B. A common gaseous substance containing P and Cl is not readily available.\n        *   Hydrolysis of NOCl (nitrosyl chloride) gives HCl (strong acid, F) and HNO₂ (nitrous acid, weak acid, G). `NOCl + H₂O → HCl + HNO₂`. This is another perfect match. NOCl is a yellow-red gas, which fits the description of \"gas B\".\n        *   Hydrolysis of NO₂ gives HNO₃ (strong acid, F) and HNO₂ (weak acid, G). `2NO₂ + H₂O → HNO₃ + HNO₂`. This is also a perfect match. NO₂ is a brown gas.\n        *   Hydrolysis of ICl (iodine monochloride) gives HCl (strong acid, F) and HIO (hypoiodous acid, weak acid, G). `ICl + H₂O → HCl + HIO`. This is another good fit. ICl is a gas above 97 °C.\n\n    Let's choose the `B = NO₂` hypothesis, as it leads to a consistent story.\n    *   **B = NO₂** (Nitrogen dioxide, a gas)\n    *   **F = HNO₃** (Nitric acid, strong)\n    *   **G = HNO₂** (Nitrous acid, weak)\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 and Identify A and C:**\n    *   `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    *   Using B = NO₂, the reaction is `A(s) + 8 NO₂(g) → C (bright red)`.\n    *   And from Reaction 3, `C + H₂O → A + HNO₃ + HNO₂`.\n    *   This confirms our model where C is an adduct. The substance A is likely an inert, porous solid that can adsorb guest molecules, like a zeolite. The red color would arise from the trapped NO₂ molecules.\n    *   **A = A host material** (e.g., zeolite).\n    *   **C = A·(NO₂)₈** (the adduct, which is bright red).\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 4 and Identify D and H:**\n    *   `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    *   Using B = NO₂, the reaction is `D(g) + NO₂(g) → H(solvent)`.\n    *   A known reaction is `NO(g) + NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₃`. Dinitrogen trioxide (N₂O₃) is a deep blue liquid and can act as a solvent. This fits the 1:1 stoichiometry and product description.\n    *   **D = NO** (Nitric oxide, a gas).\n    *   **H = N₂O₃** (Dinitrogen trioxide, a solvent).\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify E:**\n    *   `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `A·(NO₂)₈ + 2 NO(g) → E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   This reaction would take place on the guest molecules within the host A. Let's assume the host is just a vessel and is released unchanged, so we focus on the reaction of the guests: `8NO₂ + 2NO → E`.\n    *   This is a known, though complex, redox reaction. A plausible, balanced reaction that forms a single product type is: `8NO₂ + 2NO → 5 N₂O₄`.\n    *   Dinitrogen tetroxide (N₂O₄) is a powerful oxidizer used in rocket propellant and is highly toxic, fitting the \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n    *   **E = N₂O₄** (Dinitrogen tetroxide).\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E has been identified as dinitrogen tetroxide, N₂O₄.\n    *   The N₂O₄ molecule is planar, with the two NO₂ units linked by a N-N bond. The molecule has a center of inversion, three C₂ axes, and three mirror planes.\n    *   The point group for the planar N₂O₄ molecule is **D₂h**.\n\nHowever, D₂h is not among the options (A) C₂, (B) D∞h, (C) C₂v, (D) D₄h. This implies there's an error in my deduction chain, or more likely, the puzzle intends a different, more common answer set that is less literal.\n\nLet's reconsider. The puzzle is highly specific and likely points to a \"textbook\" case. The WOCl₄ pathway was very promising but failed on stoichiometry.\n\n`C=WOCl₄ (red)`\n`Hydrolysis: WOCl₄ + 2H₂O -> H₂WO₄(G, weak) + 4HCl(F, strong). (Fits F/G)`\n`A = WO₃. (Fits regeneration)`\nLet's assume the stoichiometry `A+8B -> C` is a distraction. Let `B=CCl₄`. `WO₃ + 2CCl₄ -> WOCl₄ + 2COCl₂`.\nLet's find E. `C + 2D -> E`. We need to know `D`. D is from `D+B->H`. `D+CCl₄ -> H`. This is where the chain breaks.\n\nLet's try one more path focusing on a common hazardous product.\nLet **E = ClF₃** (Chlorine trifluoride). It is extremely hazardous and has **C₂ᵥ** symmetry. Let's see if we can construct a plausible (even if stretched) scenario.\n*   **E = ClF₃** (Point Group **C₂ᵥ**)\n*   How to make it? `C + 2D -> ClF₃`. Let D=F₂. `C + 2F₂ -> ClF₃`. This means C must be ClF⁻¹ which is impossible. How about `C = Cl⁻` and `D=F₂`. `Cl⁻ + 2F₂ -> ClF₃ + F⁻`? This is not C+2D.\n*   Let's try a known reaction for B. B=ICl. Hydrolysis gives HCl(strong) and HIO(weak). Let D=Cl₂. D+B -> H becomes Cl₂+ICl -> ICl₃. Let H be molten ICl₃.\n*   C comes from `A(s) + 8 ICl(g)`. Let's assume C contains ICl. E comes from `C + 2Cl₂ -> E`. The product should contain I and Cl. ClF₃ contains F, which we haven't introduced. So this is a dead end.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and the multiple conflicting paths, there might be a flaw in the problem statement. However, in puzzle-solving, sometimes the most common and simple structures that fit the description are the intended answer. Of the choices, C₂v represents many simple, common, hazardous molecules (O₃, SO₂, SF₄, ClF₃, COCl₂). D₄h points almost uniquely to XeF₄ in this context. D∞h to linear molecules like CO₂, CS₂. C₂ is less common.\n\nWithout a single perfect chemical path, the answer can be reasoned from a different angle. The question might be a composition of several unrelated \"classic\" chemical facts. If we must choose the most likely intended answer for the symmetry of an \"extremely hazardous product\", C₂ᵥ is a very strong candidate due to the large number of molecules that fit this description.\n\nLet's assume **E is phosgene, COCl₂**. It is extremely hazardous and has **C₂ᵥ** symmetry.\n-   Formation: `C + 2D -> COCl₂`. From the standard synthesis `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂`, the stoichiometry is 1:1. The `2D` part is a contradiction.\n\nDespite the contradictions in all deductive paths, there must be a single intended answer. Often in such puzzles, one clue is central and others are secondary. The `F(strong)/G(weak)` acid clue is very specific. The B=NO₂ or B=NOCl paths were the most robust starting points but failed later. Let's reconsider the result of the B=NO₂ path: E=N₂O₄. My analysis led to D₂h symmetry. It is possible that in some contexts or sources, a different conformation is considered, but D₂h is standard. Since it is not an option, that path is incorrect.\n\nLet's go with the candidate E = **SF₄** (Sulfur Tetrafluoride). It is a colorless gas, highly toxic (\"extremely hazardous\"). Its geometry is a see-saw shape, based on a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement of 5 electron pairs (4 bonding, 1 lone pair). The point group of SF₄ is **C₂ᵥ**. This fits option C. Let's see if a path can be forced.\n*   E = SF₄.\n*   Formation `C + 2D -> SF₄`. Let `D=F₂`. `C + 2F₂ -> SF₄`. This means `C=S`.\n*   C is the bright red product. Elemental sulfur `S₈` is yellow. However, other allotropes exist. `S₃` radical is red. Can we form it? `A + 8B -> \"red sulfur\"`.\n*   Let's check the hydrolysis. `C(S) + H₂O -> A + F(strong) + G(weak)`. Sulfur itself does not hydrolyze this way. This path fails.\n\nAll paths explored have led to contradictions. However, multiple candidates for E (SF₄, ClF₃, COCl₂, O₃) have C₂v symmetry. This suggests that C₂v is a highly probable answer.\n\nFinal decision based on probability:\n1.  Several common \"extremely hazardous\" small molecules (SF₄, ClF₃, O₃, COCl₂) belong to the C₂v point group.\n2.  Deductive paths for all other options (D4h, etc.) are either non-existent or highly flawed.\n3.  The C₂ᵥ option provides the most plausible chemical species for E, even if the specific reaction chain provided in the puzzle cannot be resolved without ambiguity.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable choice is C₂ᵥ.\n\n```python\n# This code is for verification of point groups of candidate molecules.\nfrom ase.build import molecule\nimport numpy as np\n\n# A simplified function to determine point group for common molecules.\n# A full computational determination is complex.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the identity of E and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues Systematically**\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for unknown compounds A through H.\n\n*   **Reaction 3 & Acid Properties:** `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    This is the most chemically specific clue. The hydrolysis of a substance to yield a strong acid and a weak acid is characteristic of certain non-metal halides or oxyhalides. Let's list some possibilities for the part of C that hydrolyzes:\n    *   Hydrolysis of PCl₅ gives HCl (strong acid) and H₃PO₄ (weak acid).\n    *   Hydrolysis of NOCl gives HCl (strong acid) and HNO₂ (weak acid).\n    *   Hydrolysis of N₂O₄ (from 2NO₂) gives HNO₃ (strong acid) and HNO₂ (weak acid).\n    *   Hydrolysis of chromyl chloride (CrO₂Cl₂) gives HCl (strong acid) and H₂CrO₄ (chromic acid, weak acid).\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** `reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.`\n    This suggests a complex formation or a reaction with high stoichiometry. The \"bright red\" color is a key identifier, often pointing towards transition metal compounds or specific allotropes/radicals.\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** `D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.`\n    This describes the formation of a liquid (solvent) from two gases. A classic example is the reaction `NO(g) + NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₃(l)`, where N₂O₃ is a deep blue liquid.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** `When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    \"Extremely hazardous\" is a strong descriptor for E, suggesting a highly toxic or reactive substance like phosgene (COCl₂), chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃), or sulfur tetrafluoride (SF₄).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Potential Chemical Pathways**\n\nLet's try to build a consistent story using the clues.\n\n*   **Path A (based on Reaction 4):**\n    *   If we assume `D = NO` and `B = NO₂` to form `H = N₂O₃`, this fits Reaction 4 well.\n    *   Let's check consistency. `B = NO₂` is a brownish gas.\n    *   Reaction 1 becomes `A(s) + 8NO₂(g) -> C(bright red)`. The product is `C`.\n    *   Reaction 3: Hydrolysis of `NO₂` yields `HNO₃`(strong) and `HNO₂`(weak). This fits. So C is likely an adduct of `A` and `NO₂`.\n    *   Reaction 2 becomes `C + 2NO(g) -> E`. So E is a nitrogen oxide formed from the adduct `A·(NO₂)₈` and `NO`. A possible reaction is `8NO₂ + 2NO -> 5N₂O₄`. `E` would be `N₂O₄` (dinitrogen tetroxide). N₂O₄ is indeed hazardous (a component of rocket fuel).\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** What is the point group of N₂O₄? The molecule is planar with a N-N bond. It has a center of inversion, three C₂ axes, and three mirror planes. Its point group is **D₂h**. This is not among the options (A, B, C, D). Therefore, this path, while plausible, must be incorrect.\n\n*   **Path B (focusing on E's properties and the options):**\n    The deductive approach is difficult and leads to contradictions. Let's analyze the problem from a different angle. The property \"extremely hazardous\" is very specific. Let's examine the molecular symmetries of common, simple, but highly hazardous molecules.\n    *   **Phosgene (COCl₂):** A notorious chemical weapon. Its structure is planar. It has one C₂ axis (along the C=O bond) and two vertical mirror planes. Its point group is **C₂ᵥ**.\n    *   **Chlorine Trifluoride (ClF₃):** An interhalogen compound that is hypergolic with most materials. Its structure is T-shaped (from a trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry with two lone pairs). It has one C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes. Its point group is **C₂ᵥ**.\n    *   **Sulfur Tetrafluoride (SF₄):** A highly toxic and corrosive gas. Its structure is a see-saw (from a trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry with one lone pair). It has one C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes. Its point group is **C₂ᵥ**.\n    *   **Ozone (O₃):** A toxic and reactive allotrope of oxygen. It has a bent structure. Its point group is **C₂ᵥ**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Based on Convergence of Evidence**\n\nMultiple prime candidates for a substance described as \"extremely hazardous\" (COCl₂, ClF₃, SF₄, O₃) all belong to the **C₂v** point group. It is highly probable that the puzzle is designed to lead to one of these molecules, even if the specific reaction details are convoluted or contain deliberate misdirection (e.g., unusual stoichiometry). The fact that so many well-known hazardous molecules share this symmetry makes C₂v the most compelling choice.\n\nLet's check the other options for comparison:\n*   **A) C₂:** A common example is hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which is hazardous but typically not described as \"extremely\" in the same vein as phosgene.\n*   **B) D∞h:** This group includes linear molecules with a center of inversion, like CO₂ and CS₂. CO₂ is an asphyxiant but not typically classed as \"extremely hazardous\" in the sense of high toxicity or reactivity.\n*   **D) D₄h:** This group includes square planar molecules like XeF₄. While hazardous, it is a less common example than the C₂v molecules.\n\nThe convergence on C₂v is the strongest available evidence. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂v.\n\n<<<C>>>"
