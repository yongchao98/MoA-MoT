    "The user wants to identify the mutation most likely to inactivate a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. Gene inactivation is most effectively achieved by mutations that severely disrupt the protein's structure, such as nonsense or frameshift mutations.\n\nLet's analyze the effects of each mutation by translating the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences. The reading frame starts with the 'ATG' start codon. The genetic code is used to determine the amino acid for each three-base codon.\n\n1.  **Intact Gene Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n    *   Translation: Met (M) - Phe (F) - Leu (L) - Ala (A) - Gly (G) - Thr (T) - Ser (S) - Val (V) - Asp (D)...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to inactivate.\n\n2.  **Mutant 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n    *   Alignment with Intact:\n        *   Intact: ...TTT CTC...\n        *   Mutant: ...TTC TAC...\n    *   Change 1: TTT -> TTC. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a silent mutation.\n    *   Change 2: CTC -> TAC. CTC codes for Leucine (L), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Y). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid in the protein.\n    *   Resulting Protein: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n    *   Effect: A single amino acid change might affect protein function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. This is a less severe mutation compared to others.\n\n3.  **Mutant 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n    *   Alignment with Intact:\n        *   Intact: ...TTT CTC...\n        *   Mutant: ...TTC TAA...\n    *   Change 1: TTT -> TTC (Silent, Phe -> Phe).\n    *   Change 2: CTC -> TAA. CTC codes for Leucine (L), but TAA is a **stop codon**.\n    *   Resulting Protein: Met - Phe - (Stop)\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon, leading to the production of a drastically shortened, 2-amino-acid peptide. Such a truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n4.  **Mutant 3 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…\n    *   Comparing lengths, Mutant 3 has 46 characters while the intact sequence has 45 (for the segment shown). This indicates an insertion.\n    *   Alignment:\n        *   Intact:   ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n        *   Mutant 3: ATG TTT **T**AC GCT GGT GTC ACT...\n    *   There appears to be an insertion of a single thymine ('T') after the second codon. This shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons.\n    *   Effect: This is a **frameshift mutation**. The new reading frame is:\n        *   New sequence: ATG TTT TCG CTG GTA CTT... (from `CTCGCTGGTACTT...` shifted by one base 'T' from the start)\n        *   This does not match the mutant sequence. Let's re-examine the mutant string.\n        *   Mutant 3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...\n        *   Compared to Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n        *   This represents two separate **missense mutations**: CTC -> TAC (Leu -> Tyr) and ACT -> GTC (Thr -> Val). The effect is the change of two amino acids. This is less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n5.  **Mutant 4 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…\n    *   Comparing lengths, Mutant 4 has 42 characters, while the intact sequence has 45. This indicates a deletion of 3 bases (one codon).\n    *   Alignment:\n        *   Intact:   ATG TTT CTC GCT **GGT** ACT TCT...\n        *   Mutant 4: ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT...\n    *   There is a missense mutation (CTC -> TAC, changing Leu to Tyr) and a deletion of the codon 'GGT' (which codes for Glycine).\n    *   Effect: This is an **in-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this can disrupt function, it is generally less severe than a premature stop codon or a frameshift that scrambles the entire downstream sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Mutant 1: Missense (likely weak effect).\n*   **Mutant 2: Nonsense (strongest effect).**\n*   Mutant 3: Two Missense mutations (moderate effect).\n*   Mutant 4: Missense + In-frame deletion (moderate to strong effect).\n\nThe mutation most likely to completely eliminate the function of the anti-nutritional protein is the **nonsense mutation** in Mutant 2. It truncates the protein to a mere two amino acids, making it non-functional.\n\n<<<A>>>"
