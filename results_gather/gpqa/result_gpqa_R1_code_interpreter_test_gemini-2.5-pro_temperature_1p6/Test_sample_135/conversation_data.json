    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Vector Field:**\n    The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over a volume `V` which is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n    The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to solve this kind of problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n    *Note on the singularity:* The field `f` is infinite at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume. While the Divergence Theorem requires the field to be well-behaved inside the volume, we can apply it here because the calculation is performed on the boundary surface `S` (where `r=R`), where the field is perfectly well-behaved. The theorem correctly handles the contribution from the singularity at the origin.\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    We need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   **The field on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the field `f` on the surface is:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n    *   **The differential surface area element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` also points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, it is given by:\n        `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat`\n        where `θ` is the polar angle and `φ` is the azimuthal angle.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    Now we take the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ) * r_hat]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n    Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out. This implies the result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ) * (∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ)`\n    Let's evaluate each part:\n    *   `∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   `∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 2π * 2 = 4π`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis result is a fundamental concept in physics (related to Gauss's Law), where the total flux from a source with a `1/r^2` field is constant (`4π` in this normalized case) and independent of the size of the enclosing surface.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nOur calculated answer is `4π`, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
