    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (M_total = m1 + m2).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:** The solution relies on combining two fundamental laws of orbital mechanics for binary stars:\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the total mass of a system (M_total) to its orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (a). The formula is:\n        M_total = (4 * π² * a³) / (G * P²)\n        where G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   **Relationship between Velocity, Period, and Orbit Size:** For a star in a circular orbit, its orbital velocity (v) is related to its orbital radius (a_star, its semi-major axis around the center of mass) and period (P) by:\n        v = (2 * π * a_star) / P\n\n3.  **Use the Observational Data:**\n    *   **Spectroscopic Observations:** The radial velocity amplitudes (K) are the maximum observed line-of-sight velocities. For a star, its radial velocity amplitude K is related to its true orbital velocity v by K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n    *   **Eclipse Information:** The problem states both systems are *eclipsing*. This is crucial because it tells us that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle 'i' is very close to 90°, and therefore sin(i) ≈ 1. This allows us to approximate the true orbital velocity with the measured radial velocity amplitude (v ≈ K).\n\n4.  **Derive the Mass-Observable Relationship:**\n    *   From the velocity relation, we can express the semi-major axis of each star's orbit:\n        a₁ ≈ (K₁ * P) / (2 * π)\n        a₂ ≈ (K₂ * P) / (2 * π)\n    *   The semi-major axis of the *relative* orbit 'a' is the sum of the individual semi-major axes:\n        a = a₁ + a₂ ≈ [(K₁ * P) / (2 * π)] + [(K₂ * P) / (2 * π)]\n        a ≈ (P / (2 * π)) * (K₁ + K₂)\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Third Law:\n        M_total ≈ (4 * π² / (G * P²)) * [ (P / (2 * π)) * (K₁ + K₂) ]³\n        M_total ≈ (4 * π² / (G * P²)) * [ P³ * (K₁ + K₂ )³ / (8 * π³) ]\n    *   Simplifying the expression, we get:\n        M_total ≈ (P * (K₁ + K₂ )³) / (2 * π * G)\n    *   This result shows that the total mass of an eclipsing binary system is proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes:\n        **M_total ∝ P * (K_sum)³**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Proportional Mass for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   M_sys1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n        *   M_sys2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    *   The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2.\n    *   Ratio = 6750 / 15625\n\nTo simplify and find the decimal value, we can use a small Python script.\n\n```python\n# System 1 data\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_sum = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 data\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_sum = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3.\n# We calculate this proportional value for each system.\nmass_prop_1 = P1 * (K1_sum)**3\nmass_prop_2 = P2 * (K2_sum)**3\n\n# The ratio of the actual masses is the same as the ratio of these proportional values.\nratio = mass_prop_1 / mass_prop_2\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is 0.432. Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass of each system and then find their ratio (Mass_sys1 / Mass_sys2).\n\n### Step 1: Recall the relationship between mass, period, and velocity in a binary system.\n\nFor a binary star system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's Third Law:\nM_total = (4π² a³) / (G P²)\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe semi-major axis of the relative orbit, 'a', is the sum of the semi-major axes of the individual stars' orbits around the center of mass (a = a1 + a2).\n\n### Step 2: Relate observational quantities to physical properties.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the star's orbital velocity (v) by K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the orbital inclination. For an eclipsing binary system, the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination 'i' is close to 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, we can approximate the orbital velocity with the radial velocity amplitude (v ≈ K).\n\nFor a circular orbit, a star's orbital velocity 'v' is related to its orbital radius 'a_star' and period 'P' by v = (2π a_star) / P. We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis of each star's orbit:\na1 ≈ (K1 * P) / (2π)\na2 ≈ (K2 * P) / (2π)\n\nThe total semi-major axis 'a' is then:\na = a1 + a2 ≈ (P / 2π) * (K1 + K2)\n\n### Step 3: Derive a formula for mass using only the observed quantities.\n\nSubstitute the expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Third Law:\nM_total ≈ (4π² / (G P²)) * [ (P / 2π) * (K1 + K2) ]³\nM_total ≈ (4π² / (G P²)) * [ P³ * (K1 + K2)³ / (8π³) ]\nM_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2πG)\n\nThis shows that the total mass of an eclipsing binary system is proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n**M_total ∝ P * (K_sum)³**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the masses.\n\nNow we can use this proportionality to find the ratio of the masses of the two systems.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Mass_sys1 ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Mass_sys2 ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Calculate the ratio:**\nRatio = Mass_sys1 / Mass_sys2 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432\n\nThe calculation confirms that system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
