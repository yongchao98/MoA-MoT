    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 (L₁ / L₂).\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n- Radius ratio: R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  => R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n- Mass ratio: M₁ = 1.5 * M₂ (This information is not needed for the calculation as we treat the stars as black bodies).\n- Radial velocities: v₁ = 0 km/s, v₂ = 700 km/s.\n- Observed peak wavelengths are equal: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n- The stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n**3. Recall Relevant Physical Laws:**\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (4πR²) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T).\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak wavelength (λ_emitted) at which a black body emits most of its radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature (T).\n    λ_emitted = b / T\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n\n*   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted. For an object moving away from the observer (redshift), the formula is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * √[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]\n    where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. For a stationary object (v=0), λ_obs = λ_emitted. The standard convention is that a positive radial velocity indicates recession.\n\n**4. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe are given R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nNow we need to find the temperature ratio, T₁/T₂.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\nWe can find the temperature ratio using the information about the observed peak wavelengths.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** v₁ = 0 km/s. It is stationary relative to the observer.\n    λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1\n    Using Wien's Law: λ_obs,1 = b / T₁\n\n*   **For Star_2:** v₂ = 700 km/s. It is moving away from the observer.\n    Let β = v₂/c. The observed wavelength is redshifted.\n    λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)]\n    Using Wien's Law: λ_obs,2 = (b / T₂) * √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)]\n\n*   **Equate the Observed Wavelengths:** We are given λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)]\n    1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * √[(1 + β) / (1 - β)]\n    Rearranging to find the temperature ratio T₁/T₂:\n    T₁ / T₂ = √[(1 - β) / (1 + β)]\n\n**6. Substitute and Calculate:**\nNow substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√[(1 - β) / (1 + β)])⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [(1 - β) / (1 + β)]²\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the numerical calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Radius ratio\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n# Velocity of Star_2 (km/s)\nv2 = 700.0\n# Speed of light (km/s)\nc = 299792.458\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# The temperature ratio T1/T2 is derived from the equality of observed peak wavelengths,\n# considering the Doppler shift for Star_2.\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))\n# The luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# This simplifies to L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))^2\n\n# Calculate the (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) term\ndoppler_factor = (1.0 - beta) / (1.0 + beta)\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * doppler_factor**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n2.2290483863740266\n\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to the luminosity of Star 2 (L₁/L₂).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Radius of Star 1 (R₁) is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2 (R₂). So, R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   The mass information (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is extra information and not needed for this specific problem, as we are using the black body radiation laws.\n    *   The observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2).\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 1 (v₁) is 0 km/s (it's stationary relative to the observer).\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 2 (v₂) is 700 km/s (it's moving away from the observer).\n    *   Both stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n3.  **Recall Relevant Physical Laws:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak wavelength of emission (λ_emitted) from a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: λ_emitted = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Relativistic Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a source moving with radial velocity v is related to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the formula:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))\n        where c is the speed of light. A positive v indicates recession (moving away), which causes a redshift (observed wavelength is longer).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    We know R₁/R₂ = 1.5, so:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):**\n    We need to find the temperature ratio using the information about the wavelengths.\n\n    *   **For Star 1 (stationary):** v₁ = 0. The Doppler effect formula simplifies, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.\n        Using Wien's Law: λ_obs,1 = b/T₁.\n\n    *   **For Star 2 (moving away):** v₂ = 700 km/s. The observed wavelength is Doppler shifted.\n        λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c))\n        Using Wien's Law (λ_emitted,2 = b/T₂):\n        λ_obs,2 = (b/T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c))\n\n    *   **Equate the observed wavelengths:** We are given λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c))\n        Canceling 'b' and rearranging to find T₁/T₂:\n        T₂/T₁ = √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c))\n        So, T₁/T₂ = √((1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c))\n\n6.  **Combine and Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    Now substitute the expression for (T₁/T₂)⁴ into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√((1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c)))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c))²\n\n    To get the numerical value, we'll let a Python script do the calculation.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Luminosity Ratio:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n    The ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to Star 2 is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\n    Simplifying this by canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Use the Given Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T₁/T₂):** To find the temperature ratio, we use the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** Relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength at which it *emits* its light (λ_emitted): λ_emitted = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** Relates the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) to the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) based on the star's radial velocity (v). For an object moving away, the observed wavelength is redshifted:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * √((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)), where c is the speed of light.\n\n    Let's apply this to each star:\n    *   **Star 1:** v₁ = 0. There is no Doppler shift, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1. Using Wien's law:\n        λ_obs,1 = b/T₁\n\n    *   **Star 2:** v₂ = 700 km/s. There is a Doppler shift.\n        λ_emitted,2 = b/T₂\n        λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c)) = (b/T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c))\n\n    The problem states the observed wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c))\n\n    We can cancel 'b' and rearrange the equation to find the temperature ratio T₁/T₂:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / √((1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c)) = √((1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c))\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute this expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (√((1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c)))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * ((1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c))²\n\n    The numerical calculation was performed using the provided code, which yielded:\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.22908\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23.
