    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C8H9NO, DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation, leaving one more degree of unsaturation, which is likely a C=O double bond.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (1H proton coupled with 2H neighbors -> t). This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest an electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of an amine (-NH2) group, which is an electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals. The nitrogen atom from the molecular formula is accounted for.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH2-). The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (2H protons coupled with 1H neighbor -> d). This is consistent with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where these CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO (ethanal) group.\n    *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n    *   The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5°C)**\n    *   This is the diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The product is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride: `[N₂]⁺-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO Cl⁻`.\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    *   The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water upon heating to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The product is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the -CH₂- group), which are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Step 3a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct.\n        *   **Nucleophile:** `⁻CH(CHO)-(C₆H₄-OH)`\n        *   **Electrophile:** `O=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-OH)`\n        *   **Adduct:** After protonation, the adduct formed is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This matches option D).\n    *   **Step 3b: Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol adduct readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from C3 and the acidic α-hydrogen from C2 are eliminated.\n        *   **Adduct (D):** `(HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂(4)-CH(OH)(3)-CH(C₆H₄OH)(2)-CHO(1)`\n        *   **Dehydration (-H₂O):** Elimination of H from C2 and OH from C3.\n        *   **Final Product:** `(HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)=C(C₆H₄OH)(2)-CHO(1)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\n*   Let's name the structure derived from the condensation step: `(HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄OH)-CHO`.\n*   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde, C=C bond).\n*   The aldehyde is at position 1. The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it is a `but-2-enal`.\n*   There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C2 and another `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C4.\n*   The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This structure and name perfectly match option B. Option D is the intermediate aldol adduct, which is not the final product under heating conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
