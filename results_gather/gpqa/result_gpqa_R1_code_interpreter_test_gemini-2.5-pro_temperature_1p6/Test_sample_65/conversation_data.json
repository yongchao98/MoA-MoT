    "SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. The construction of these operators must respect the fundamental symmetries of the underlying theoretical framework. Let's analyze each proposed symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in the theory of special relativity. The Standard Model and its extensions are formulated as Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. All terms in the Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional SMEFT operators, must be constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, encompassing Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle of quantum field theory upon which the Standard Model and SMEFT are built. Invariance under Poincare transformations is a requirement for the theory.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) is the combination of charge conjugation and parity transformation. It is well-established experimentally that the Standard Model violates CP symmetry, primarily through a complex phase in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction. Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it does not need to respect CP symmetry. In fact, many SMEFT operators can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, CP is *not* a required symmetry for all operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** CPT (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal) is a consequence of fundamental principles in quantum field theory. The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nIn summary, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
