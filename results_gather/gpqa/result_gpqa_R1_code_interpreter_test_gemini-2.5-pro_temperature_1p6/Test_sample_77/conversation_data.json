    "The problem asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ generated by a moving point charge q. These are the well-known Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts**:\n    The electromagnetic potentials (V and $\\vec{A}$) at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t due to time-varying charge and current distributions ($\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t')$ and $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t')$) are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\n    Here, $t_r$ is the *retarded time*, which is the time at which the signal (field) must have been emitted from the source point $\\vec{r'}$ to reach the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time t. Since the signal propagates at the speed of light c, the time delay is $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$. Thus, the retarded time is given by:\n    $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n2.  **Applying to a Point Charge**:\n    For a single point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V)**:\n    Substituting the charge density into the formula for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    The integral is tricky because the retarded time $t_r$ in the argument of the delta function itself depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$.\n\n    The standard evaluation of this integral (found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks) accounts for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears distorted due to the retardation effect. This leads to a correction factor in the denominator. The result of the integration is:\n\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|c})} \\right]$\n\n    Let's use the notation given in the problem:\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n    Substituting this notation into the expression for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{dc})} \\right] = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}}$\n\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)**:\n    Similarly, for the vector potential:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\n    Since $\\vec{v}(t_r)$ is evaluated at the retarded time, it's constant with respect to the spatial integration over $\\vec{r'}$. We can pull it out of the integral:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\vec{v}(t_r)}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\n    The remaining integral is exactly what we evaluated for V, but without the $1/\\epsilon_o$ factor. So:\n    $\\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n    Therefore, using the problem's notation:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right)$\n\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    The derived potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match option C. Note that the vector potential can also be written in terms of the scalar potential:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} V = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$. Option C correctly relates $\\vec{A}$ and V in this way. Option B has an incorrect sign in the denominator. Options A and D use the static potential form, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects retardation effects.\n\n<<<C>>>"
