    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For a relativistic particle moving in a conservative potential `U(x)`, the total energy `E` is conserved. This total energy is the sum of the relativistic energy of the particle (`γmc²`) and its potential energy (`U(x)`).\n    `E = γmc² + U(x)`\n    where `m` is the rest mass, `c` is the speed of light, `v` is the particle's speed, and `γ` is the Lorentz factor, given by `γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the potential energy `U(x)`**.\n    The force is given by Hooke's Law: `F = -kx`. The potential energy is related to the force by `F = -dU/dx`. We can find the potential energy by integrating the force:\n    `U(x) - U(0) = -∫_0^x F dx' = -∫_0^x (-kx') dx' = 1/2 kx²`\n    By convention, we set the potential energy at the equilibrium position `x=0` to be zero, so `U(0) = 0`. Thus, the potential energy function is:\n    `U(x) = 1/2 kx²`\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points in the oscillation.**\n\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops. Therefore, its velocity `v = 0`.\n        When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1/√(1 - 0²/c²) = 1`.\n        The total energy `E` at this point is:\n        `E = (1)mc² + U(A) = mc² + 1/2 kA²`\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is minimum (`U(0) = 0`), which means the kinetic energy and the speed are at their maximum. Let this maximum speed be `v_max`.\n        The Lorentz factor at this speed is `γ_max = 1/√(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n        The total energy `E` at this point is:\n        `E = γ_max * mc² + U(0) = γ_max * mc² + 0 = γ_max * mc²`\n\n4.  **Equate the expressions for total energy and solve for `v_max`**.\n    Since the total energy `E` is conserved throughout the oscillation, the energy at `x=A` must be equal to the energy at `x=0`.\n    `mc² + 1/2 kA² = γ_max * mc²`\n\n    Now, we solve for `γ_max`:\n    `γ_max = (mc² + 1/2 kA²) / mc²`\n    `γ_max = 1 + kA² / (2mc²) `\n\n    Next, we use the definition of `γ_max` to find `v_max`:\n    `γ_max = 1/√(1 - v_max²/c²) `\n    Substitute the expression we found for `γ_max`:\n    `1 + kA² / (2mc²) = 1/√(1 - v_max²/c²) `\n\n    To solve for `v_max`, we can first solve for the term `(1 - v_max²/c²)`:\n    `√(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))`\n    Square both sides:\n    `1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate `v_max²/c²`:\n    `v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²`\n\n    Finally, multiply by `c²` and take the square root to get `v_max`:\n    `v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²]`\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for `v_max` is:\n    `v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}`\n    This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
