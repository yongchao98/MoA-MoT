    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Identify the system and the potential:**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations in all three dimensions (x, y, z).\n\n**2. Determine the energy eigenvalues:**\nThe Hamiltonian for this system can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in Cartesian coordinates:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x_i^2$ for $i=x,y,z$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_n = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n**3. Find the energy of the third excited state:**\nThe energy levels are indexed by the quantum number $n$.\n*   Ground state: $n=0$, $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   First excited state: $n=1$, $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Second excited state: $n=2$, $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state:** $n=3$, $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Determine the degeneracy of the third excited state:**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that give the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. We need to find the number of ways to choose three non-negative integers that sum to $n=3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nWe can also list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0): Permutations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). (3 states)\n*   (2, 1, 0): Permutations are (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). (6 states)\n*   (1, 1, 1): Only one combination. (1 state)\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**5. Compare with the given options:**\n*   Energy: $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Number of eigenfunctions (degeneracy): 10\n\nThis matches option B. The energy expression in options A and C is incorrect for a harmonic oscillator.\n\nLet's use a simple python script to confirm the calculations.\n```python\n# The principal quantum number 'n' for the energy levels of a 3D isotropic\n# harmonic oscillator starts from n=0 for the ground state.\n# Ground state: n=0\n# First excited state: n=1\n# Second excited state: n=2\n# Third excited state: n=3\nn = 3\n\n# The energy of the n-th level is given by E_n = (n + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n# For n=3, E_3 = (3 + 3/2) * hbar * omega = (9/2) * hbar * omega.\nenergy_numerator = 2 * n + 3\nenergy_denominator = 2\n\n# The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for the n-th level\n# is given by the formula g_n = (n+1)*(n+2)/2.\ndegeneracy = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2\n\nprint(f\"Energy of the third excited state is ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) * hbar * omega\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is {int(degeneracy)}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n```python\n# The principal quantum number 'n' for the energy levels of a 3D isotropic\n# harmonic oscillator starts from n=0 for the ground state.\n# Ground state: n=0\n# First excited state: n=1\n# Second excited state: n=2\n# Third excited state: n=3\nn = 3\n\n# The energy of the n-th level is given by E_n = (n + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n# For n=3, E_3 = (3 + 3/2) * hbar * omega = (9/2) * hbar * omega.\nenergy_numerator = 2 * n + 3\nenergy_denominator = 2\n\n# The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for the n-th level\n# is given by the formula g_n = (n+1)*(n+2)/2.\ndegeneracy = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2\n\nprint(f\"Energy of the third excited state is ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) * hbar * omega\")\nprint(f\"The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is {int(degeneracy)}\")\n```\n</execute_code>\n[execution_results]\nEnergy of the third excited state is (9/2) * hbar * omega\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10\n[/execution_results]\nThe code confirms that for the third excited state ($n=3$), the energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10.

    "The problem asks for the energy and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Energy Levels of the 3D Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, meaning the total Hamiltonian is a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x_i^2$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the i-th dimension.\n\nThe total energy for the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nNow we identify the energy of the third excited state:\n*   **Ground state:** $n = 0$, $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** $n = 1$, $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** $n = 2$, $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** $n = 3$, $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**2. Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that yield the same value of $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ can sum to $n=3$.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level is given by:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($n=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, we can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x+n_y+n_z=3$:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n*   (1, 1, 1): Only one unique state. This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.
