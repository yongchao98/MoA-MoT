    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt piece by piece to identify the unknown substances X, Y, W, G, and B.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance B's Melting Point:** \"The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 K is equal to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B from G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   Since B is D₂O, G must be a compound that decomposes upon heating to produce D₂O. This is characteristic of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which dehydrates (or in this case, \"de-deutero-oxides\") to a metal oxide and heavy water.\n        *   So, G is a metal deuteroxide, with a formula like M(OD)ₙ.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction `X + Y -> W + G`:**\n        *   We know G is a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₙ. The \"OD\" groups must come from the reactants.\n        *   The reaction is violent and involves a liquid, Y.\n        *   For the product to be M(OD)ₙ, the liquid Y must be D₂O. This provides the necessary Deuterium and Oxygen atoms. So, **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W:** \"release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n        *   Let's check some simple gas molecules. We need to find one where the total number of protons (p) equals the total number of neutrons (n).\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): p=2, n=0. (p≠n)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. D₂ has p=2, n=2. (p=n). This is a strong candidate.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): p=2, n=1. (p≠n)\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen): ¹⁴N has p=7, n=7. N₂ has p=14, n=14. (p=n). Possible.\n        *   O₂ (Oxygen): ¹⁶O has p=8, n=8. O₂ has p=16, n=16. (p=n). Possible.\n        *   The reaction is now `X + D₂O -> W + M(OD)ₙ`. Given that D₂O is a reactant, the most logical gas to be produced is D₂. This fits the (p=n) rule. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Identifying Substance X:**\n        *   The reaction is `X + D₂O -> D₂ + M(OD)ₙ`. This is the classic reaction of a metal deuteride with heavy water.\n        *   The prompt also states \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\". This confirms X must contain Deuterium.\n        *   So, X is a metal deuteride. Which one?\n        *   **Clue 5a: Organic Chemistry Reagent:** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common laboratory reagents. Analogs would be the hydrogen version vs. the deuterium version.\n        *   **Clue 5b: Keto Acid Reaction:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from 3 to 2 is a reduction. Specifically, the reduction of both the ketone to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OH) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CH₂-OH) would result in a diol, a product with 2 oxygens. This double reduction requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n        *   The most common powerful reducing agent for this purpose in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, used for isotopic labeling, is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n            *   It contains a heavy isotope (D). Yes.\n            *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a major reagent. Yes.\n            *   It's a strong reducing agent that would convert a keto acid to a diol (2 oxygens). Yes.\n            *   Its reaction with Y (D₂O) should be: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n                *   Is the reaction violent? Yes, extremely.\n                *   Is the gas W = D₂? Yes.\n                *   Is a precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ formed? Yes, aluminum deuteroxide is a precipitate, analogous to aluminum hydroxide.\n        *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The note clarifies that if multiple atoms of an element are present, all their masses should be summed.\n    *   Substance X = **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   Lightest element: **Hydrogen**. The isotope present is Deuterium (D). There are **4** atoms of D.\n    *   Heaviest element: **Aluminum**. There is **1** atom of Al.\n    *   We need the atomic masses for the calculation. We can use integer mass numbers, which is standard for this type of problem.\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D, or ²H) ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (²⁷Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   Calculate the total mass for the lightest element: 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Calculate the total mass for the heaviest element: 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative mass: 8 amu + 27 amu = **35 amu**.\n\n3.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   The options are A) 25, B) 31, C) 35, D) 29.\n    *   The result matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and all clues are satisfied. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n<<<C>>>"
